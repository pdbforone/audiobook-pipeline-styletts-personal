# Phase 3 Chunking Configuration - Optimized for Fish Speech TTS

json_path: pipeline.json
chunks_dir: chunks

# Fish Speech optimized chunk sizes (MUCH larger than Chatterbox)
chunk_min_words: 200   # ~750 chars (was 60)
chunk_max_words: 400   # ~1750 chars (was 100)
chunk_min_chars: 1000   # Minimum chunk size (was 200)
chunk_max_chars: 2000  # Maximum chunk size (was 312)

# Quality thresholds
coherence_threshold: 0.4  # LOWERED: Classical texts have lower coherence due to aphorisms
flesch_threshold: 60
max_chunk_duration: 45.0  # Increased from 25s (Fish Speech can handle longer)

# Fish Speech can handle much larger chunks than Chatterbox (500 chars max)
# This reduces total chunk count and overhead significantly
# Example: 441 chunks (old) → ~150 chunks (new) for same audiobook
