Nothing is more disgraceful than a wolfish
friendship, false friendship. Avoid this most of all. The good and simple and benevolent show all these
things in the eyes, and there is no mistaking. As to living in the best way, this power is in the
soul, if it be indifferent to things which are
indifferent.
