Nor yet
desiring time wherein thou shalt have longer
enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society
of men with whom thou mayest live in harmony? Wilt thou never be such that thou
shalt so dwell in community with gods and men as
neither to find fault with them at all, nor to be
condemned by them?
