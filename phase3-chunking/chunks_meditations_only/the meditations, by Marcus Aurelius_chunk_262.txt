For those parts which have felt will complain, if they choose. But I, unless I think that what has happened is an evil, am not injured. And it is in my power not to think so. Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold, or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour.
