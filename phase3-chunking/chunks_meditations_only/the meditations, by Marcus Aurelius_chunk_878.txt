And even if
the tempest carry thee away, let it carry away the
poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else; for the
intelligence at least it will not carry away. Does the light of the lamp shine without losing its
splendour until it is extinguished; and shall the
truth which is in thee and justice and temperance be
extinguished before thy death?
