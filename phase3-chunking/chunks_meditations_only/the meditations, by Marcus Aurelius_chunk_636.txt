It is thy duty to leave another man's wrongful act
there where it is.
\nTermination of activity, cessation from movement and
opinion, and in a sense their death, is no evil. Turn
thy thoughts now to the consideration of thy life,
thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old
age, for in these also every change was a death.
