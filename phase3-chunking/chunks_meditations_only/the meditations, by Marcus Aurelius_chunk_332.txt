Remember this power which thou hast from nature. Speak both in the senate and to every man, whoever he may be, appropriately, not with any affectation: use plain discourse. Augustus' court, wife, daughter, descendants, ancestors, sister, Agrippa, kinsmen, intimates, friends, Areius, Maecenas, physicians and sacrificing priests, the whole court is dead.
