Thou wilt consider this then when thou art dying,
and thou wilt depart more contentedly by reflecting
thus: I am going away from such a life, in which even
my associates in behalf of whom I have striven so
much, prayed, and cared, themselves wish me to
depart, hoping perchance to get some little advantage
by it.
