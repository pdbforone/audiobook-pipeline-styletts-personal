With respect to pain, then, and
pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour,
which the universal nature employs equally, whoever
is not equally affected is manifestly acting
impiously. It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from
mankind without having had any taste of lying and
hypocrisy and luxury and pride.
