If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show
him his error. But if thou art not able, blame
thyself, or blame not even thyself. Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee
from all eternity; and the implication of causes was
from eternity spinning the thread of thy being, and
of that which is incident to it.
