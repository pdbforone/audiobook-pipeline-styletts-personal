If then there is an
invincible necessity, why dost thou resist? But if
there is a Providence which allows itself to be
propitiated, make thyself worthy of the help of the
divinity. But if there is a confusion without
\ngovernor, be content that in such a tempest thou hast
in thyself a certain ruling intelligence.
