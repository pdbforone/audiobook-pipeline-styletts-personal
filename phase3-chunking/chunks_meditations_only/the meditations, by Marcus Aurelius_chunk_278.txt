From Plato: the man who has an elevated mind and takes a view of all time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to think that human life is anything great? it is not possible, he said. Such a man then will think that death also is no evil. Certainly not. From Antisthenes: it is royal to do good and to be abused.
