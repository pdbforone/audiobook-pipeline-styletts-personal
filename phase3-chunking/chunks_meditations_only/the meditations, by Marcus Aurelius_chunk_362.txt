Generally, wickedness does no harm at all to the universe; and particularly, the wickedness of one man does no harm to another. It is only harmful to him who has it in his power to be released from it, as soon as he shall choose. To my own free will the free will of my neighbour is just as indifferent as his poor breath and flesh.
