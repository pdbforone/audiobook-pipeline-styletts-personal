If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But
perhaps he has not done wrong. Either all things proceed from one intelligent source
and come together as in one body, and the part ought
not to find fault with what is done for the benefit
of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing
else than mixture and dispersion.
