Socrates excused himself to Perdiccas for not going
to him, saying, it is because I would not perish by
the worst of all ends, that is, I would not receive a
favour and then be unable to return it. In the writings of the Ephesians there was this
precept, constantly to think of some one of the men
of former times who practised virtue.
