Well then I have had my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind, and never stop doing such good. What is thy art? To be good. And how is this accomplished well except by general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and others about the proper constitution of man?

At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding men of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with what is shown on the stage, you should not be troubled with that which takes place on the larger stage. For you see that these things must be accomplished thus, and that even they bear them who cry out O Cithaeron. And, indeed, some things are said well by the dramatic writers, of which kind is the following especially:

me and my children if the gods neglect, this has its reason too. And again,

we must not chale and fret at that which happens. And

life's harvest reap like the wheat's fruitful ear. And other things of the same kind.
