If, then, thou
maintainest thyself in the possession of these names,
without desiring to be called by these names by
others, thou wilt be another person and wilt enter on
another life. Therefore fix thyself in the possession of
\nthese few names: and if thou art able to abide in
them, abide as if thou wast removed to certain
islands of the Happy.
