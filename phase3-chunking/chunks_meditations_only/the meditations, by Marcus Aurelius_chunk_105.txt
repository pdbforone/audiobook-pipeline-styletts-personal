And the perception of this will be more apparent to thee, if thou often sayest to thyself that I am a member of the system of rational beings. But if, using the letter r, thou sayest that thou art a part thou dost not yet love men from thy heart; beneficence does not yet delight thee for its own sake; thou still doest it barely as a thing of propriety, and not yet as doing good to thyself. Let there fall externally what will on the parts which can feel the effects of this fall. For those parts which have felt will complain, if they choose. But I, unless I think that what has happened is an evil, am not injured. And it is in my power not to think so. Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold, or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour. The ruling faculty does not disturb itself; I mean, does not frighten itself or cause itself pain. But if any one else can frighten or pain it, let him do so.
