One man prays thus: how shall I be able to lie with that woman? Do thou pray thus: how shall I not desire to lie with her? Another prays thus: how shall I be released from this? Another prays: how shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: how shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: how shall I not be afraid to lose him?
