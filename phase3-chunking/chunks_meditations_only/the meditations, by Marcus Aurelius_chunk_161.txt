But perhaps thou wilt say, the gods have placed them in thy power. Well, then, is it not better to use what is in thy power like a free man than to desire in a slavish and abject way what is not in thy power? And who has told thee that the gods do not aid us even in the things which are in our power? Begin, then, to pray for such things, and thou wilt see. One man prays thus: how shall I be able to lie with that woman? Do thou pray thus: how shall I not desire to lie with her? Another prays thus: how shall I be released from this? Another prays: how shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: how shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: how shall I not be afraid to lose him? In fine, turn thy prayers this way, and see what comes. Epicurus says, in my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily sufferings, nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me; but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from perturbations and maintain its proper good.
