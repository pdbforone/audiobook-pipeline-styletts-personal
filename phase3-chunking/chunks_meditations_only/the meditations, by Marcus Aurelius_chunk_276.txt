Love mankind. Follow God. The poet says that Law rules all. And it is enough to remember that Law rules all. About death: whether it is a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms, or annihilation, it is either extinction or change. About pain: the pain which is intolerable carries us off; but that which lasts a long time is tolerable; and the mind maintains its own tranquility by retiring into itself, and the ruling faculty is not made worse.
