If gods care not for me and for my children, there is a reason for it. For the good is with me, and the just. No joining others in their wailing, no violent emotion. From Plato: but I would make this man a sufficient answer, which is this: thou sayest not well, if thou thinkest that a man who is good for anything at all ought to compute the hazard of life or death, and should not rather look to this only in all that he does, whether he is doing what is just or unjust, and the works of a good or a bad man.
