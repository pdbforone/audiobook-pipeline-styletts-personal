Suppose that thou hast detached thyself from the natural unity, for thou wast made by nature a part, but now thou hast cut thyself off, yet here there is this beautiful provision, that it is in thy power again to unite thyself. God has allowed this to no other part, after it has been separated and cut asunder, to come together again.
