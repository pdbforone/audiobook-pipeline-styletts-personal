For the movement towards injustice and intemperance
and to anger and grief and fear is nothing else than
the act of one who deviates from nature. And also
when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything
that happens, then too it deserts its post: for it is
constituted for piety and reverence towards the gods
no less than for justice.
