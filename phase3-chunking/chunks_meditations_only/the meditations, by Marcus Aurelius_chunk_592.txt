Wouldst thou wish to
please a man who does not please himself? Does a man
please himself who repents of nearly everything that
he does?
No longer let thy breathing only act in concert with
the air which surrounds thee, but let thy
intelligence also now be in harmony with the
\nintelligence which embraces all things.
