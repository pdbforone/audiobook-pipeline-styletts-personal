If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it. For let thy efforts be,

in everything always observe what the thing is which produces for thee an appearance, and resolve it by dividing it into the formal, the material, the purpose, and the time within which it must end. Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and more divine than the things which cause the various affects, and as it were pull thee by the strings.
