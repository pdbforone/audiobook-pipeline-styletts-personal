Conformably to
piety, that thou mayest be content with the lot which
is assigned to thee, for nature designed it for thee
and thee for it. Conformably to justice, that thou
mayest always speak the truth freely and without
disguise, and do the things which are agreeable to
law and according to the worth of each.
