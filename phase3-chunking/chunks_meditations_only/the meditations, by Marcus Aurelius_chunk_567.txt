Does pain or sensuous pleasure
affect thee? The senses will look to that. Has any
obstacle opposed thee in thy efforts towards an
object? if indeed thou wast making this effort
absolutely, unconditionally, or without any
reservation, certainly this obstacle is an evil to
thee considered as a rational animal.
