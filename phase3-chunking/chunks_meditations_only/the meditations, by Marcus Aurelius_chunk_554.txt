Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and
be ready to let it go. If thou didst ever see a hand cut off, or a foot, or
a head, lying anywhere apart from the rest of the
body, such does a man make himself, as far as he can,
who is not content with what happens, and separates
himself from others, or does anything unsocial.
