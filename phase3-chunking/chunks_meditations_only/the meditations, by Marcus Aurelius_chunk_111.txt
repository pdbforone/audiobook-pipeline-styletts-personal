And consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another hide the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon covered by those which come after. From Plato: the man who has an elevated mind and takes a view of all time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to think that human life is anything great? it is not possible, he said. Such a man then will think that death also is no evil. Certainly not. From Antisthenes: it is royal to do good and to be abused. It is a base thing for the countenance to be obedient and to regulate and compose itself as the mind commands, and for the mind not to be regulated and composed by itself. It is not right to vex ourselves at things, for they care nought about it. To the immortal gods and us give joy. Life must be reaped like the ripe ears of corn: one man is born; another dies. If gods care not for me and for my children, there is a reason for it. For the good is with me, and the just. No joining others in their wailing, no violent emotion.
