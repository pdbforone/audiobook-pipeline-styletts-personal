But some insuperable obstacle is in the
way? Do not be grieved then, for the cause of its not
being done depends not on thee. But it is not worth
while to live if this cannot be done. Take thy
departure then from life contentedly, just as he dies
who is in full activity, and well pleased too with
the things which are obstacles.
