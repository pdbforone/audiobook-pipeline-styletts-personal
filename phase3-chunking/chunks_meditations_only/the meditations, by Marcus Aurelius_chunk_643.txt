Thou hast endured infinite troubles through not being
contented with thy ruling faculty, when it does the
things which it is constituted by nature to do. But
enough of this. When another blames thee or hates thee, or when men
say about thee anything injurious, approach their
poor souls, penetrate within, and see what kind of
men they are.
