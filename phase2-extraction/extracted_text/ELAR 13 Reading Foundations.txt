Factors Affecting ESL Students
So, how long does it take to acquire a new language? There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question because several factors are at play. So, how long does it take to acquire a new language? There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question because several factors are at play.
Cognitive, linguistic, practical, and affective factors influence second language acquisition. Cognitive, linguistic, practical, and affective factors influence second language acquisition.
Affective Factors - Emotional factors that can affect a student's ability to learn
Many studies show a positive relationship between high self-esteem and academic achievement. Many studies show a positive relationship between high self-esteem and academic achievement.
Inhibition discourages risk-taking, which is an essential element in language learning. The lower a student's inhibition, the faster they may acquire the new language.

Cognitive / Academic Factors
The higher a student's intelligence and the stronger their academic background, the easier it will be for the student to acquire a new language. The higher a student's intelligence and the stronger their academic background, the easier it will be for the student to acquire a new language.
Once a child has studied and acquired their native language, meaning they have a high level of literacy development, their skill at learning another language will increase.

The stronger a student's skills are in their native language, the easier it will be for them to acquire a new language. The stronger a student's skills are in their native language, the easier it will be for them to acquire a new language.
Linguistic Factors
Students who are learning a second language from the same language family as their first language have, in general, a simpler task than those who aren't. For example, Spanish is a Romance language. Native Spanish speakers would most likely have an easier time learning another Romance language, such as French or Italian, than English, which is a Germanic language.

Practical Factors
Length of time in the U. S. is a factor because increased exposure to native speakers expedites student language development. Length of time in the U. S. is a factor because increased exposure to native speakers expedites student language development.
Age is a factor with multiple implications. It is generally believed that children are better at language acquisition than adults, but adults are better at learning language rules and systems. Children are less self-conscious and will speak more without fear of making a mistake, while adults are more concerned with grammar and following the rules of the language.

Culturally Responsive Reading Instruction
Teachers make many considerations to help all students feel welcome in the class environment and have opportunities to expand their worldviews. One important consideration is the books used in the classroom. To promote culturally responsive reading instruction, it is important for students to be exposed to a diverse selection of texts written by a variety of authors in different genres and styles.

One important consideration is the books used in the classroom. To promote culturally responsive reading instruction, it is important for students to be exposed to a diverse selection of texts written by a variety of authors in different genres and styles.
Students should be exposed to texts that reflect the diversity of the classroom and school communities. This includes having a variety of characters that exhibit diversity in:
Race and ethnicity
Gender
Socioeconomic status
Ability
Age
National origin
Ideally, each student should be able to see themselves in addition to those completely different than themselves represented in the texts they read. Ideally, each student should be able to see themselves in addition to those completely different than themselves represented in the texts they read.
It is an effective practice for teachers to select texts with universal themes common to most cultures, such as love, courage, friendship, and good succeeding over evil. Folktales tend to have universal themes, making them well-suited for students in a multicultural classroom.

Integration of Language Skills
Language skills include reading, writing, listening, speaking, and achieving higher levels of thinking. For students to become proficient and perform on grade level in all these areas, instructional time must be dedicated to integrating these skills. This is best accomplished when teachers integrate different skills into daily activities. For example, a lesson can begin with a shared reading, continue with individual and paired writing assignments, and end with a student-led discussion. As language skills are practiced in the classroom, the teacher must balance the expressive and receptive uses of language to develop students in all areas.

Expressive Uses of Language
Expressive language occurs when we make sounds or write down language with the intent to communicate. The language expressed varies depending on one's age, language abilities, purpose for communicating, and emotional state. There are many ways to encourage students in the classroom to integrate language skills and express language effectively.

Receptive Uses of Language
Receptive language occurs when we receive the messages of others through listening, reading, or viewing a presentation or type of visual media. Students should be encouraged to receive this information actively instead of passively. Active participants pay attention with their whole bodies: watching, listening, thinking, and responding with attention. Passive participants can let their minds wander elsewhere, often missing key pieces of information being shared with them. There are many ways to encourage students to be active participants in receiving language while at the same time integrating the language skills.

Literacy Instruction for Students with Dyslexia
There are many possible reasons why a student might struggle with reading and spelling despite receiving appropriate instruction. Decoding-related difficulties and disabilities represent the most common source of reading difficulty. There are many possible reasons why a student might struggle with reading and spelling despite receiving appropriate instruction. Decoding-related difficulties and disabilities represent the most common source of reading difficulty.
One of the more common decoding-related learning disorders is dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects a student's ability to read, spell, write, and speak. Students identified as having dyslexia typically experience some or all of the following characteristics:
Difficulty with phonological awareness (including phonemic awareness)
Difficulty reading words in isolation
Difficulty decoding unfamiliar words
Slow, inaccurate, or labored (without prosody) oral reading
Difficulty spelling
Limited reading fluency
As a result, these students often experience difficulties in reading comprehension and/or written expression and limited vocabulary growth due to limited reading experiences. As a result, these students often experience difficulties in reading comprehension and/or written expression and limited vocabulary growth due to limited reading experiences.
According to the Texas Education Agency Dyslexia Handbook, some early indicators of dyslexia include:
Preschool
Delayed speech
Difficulty with rhyming
Difficulty pronouncing words
Poor auditory memory of nursery rhymes and chants
Difficulty adding new words to vocabulary
Poor word retrieval skills (or inability to recall the right word)
Trouble learning and naming letters and numbers
Dislike of print (doesn't enjoy following along as a book is read aloud)
Kindergarten-Grade one
Difficulty breaking words into smaller parts or syllables
Difficulty identifying and manipulating sounds
Difficulty remembering the names of letters and their sounds
Difficulty decoding single words (reading words in isolation)
Difficulty spelling words phonetically (the way that they sound) or remembering letter sequences of common words often seen in print
Grade two-three
*Previously described behaviors still exist along with:
Difficulty recognizing common sight words
Difficulty recalling the correct sounds for letters and letter patterns in reading
Difficulty connecting speech sounds with appropriate letter combinations and omitting letters in words for spelling
Difficulty reading fluently
Difficulty decoding unfamiliar words
Reliance on picture clues, story theme, or guessing at words
Difficulty with written expression
Effective literacy instruction is essential for all students and is especially critical for students identified with dyslexia. Dyslexia instruction should focus on structured, systematic, and explicit instruction in the following:
Phonological Awareness (including phonemic awareness) - identifying and manipulating sounds
Sound-Symbol Association (alphabetic principle) - knowledge of the speech sounds and corresponding letter or letter combinations
Syllabication - rules related to the types and division of syllables
Orthography - the written spelling patterns and rules in a language
Morphology - the study of how morphemes (units of meaning) are combined to form words
Syntax - the set of principles regarding the sequence and function of words in a sentence
Reading Comprehension Strategies
Reading Fluency
To accommodate students with dyslexia, teachers can provide students with:
An opportunity to pre-read texts in small groups before reading aloud
Additional time for class assignments and tests or reduced/shortened assignments (without eliminating concepts)
An alternative testing location or priority seating with reduced distractions
Oral reading of directions or written materials
Word banks
Audiobooks
Text-to-speech and/or speech-to-text
Electronic spellers and/or electronic dictionaries
Adaptive learning tools
Besides academic struggles, some students with dyslexia may exhibit other complex conditions and/or behaviors. The most common co-occurring disorders with dyslexia are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific developmental language disorders, like dysgraphia.

Recognizing and Instructing Students with Dysgraphia
Difficulty with handwriting, or dysgraphia, is a different language-based disorder that frequently occurs in children with dyslexia. Those with dysgraphia struggle with writing mechanics, resulting in impaired or illegible handwriting that interferes with spelling, written expression, or both, which is unexpected for the student's age/grade.

Those with dysgraphia struggle with writing mechanics, resulting in impaired or illegible handwriting that interferes with spelling, written expression, or both, which is unexpected for the student's age/grade.
Messy handwriting (due to issues such as poor formation of letters, improper size, spacing between letters or words, or slant of words) is the main sign of dysgraphia. Additionally, some of the following characteristics can indicate dysgraphia:
Slow or labored written work
Poor pencil grip
Inadequate pressure during handwriting (too hard or too soft)
Excessive erasures
Inability to recall accurate orthographic patterns for words
"B" and "d" reversals beyond the developmentally appropriate time
Inability to copy words accurately
Inability of the student to read what was previously written
overuse of short familiar words such as "big"
Avoidance of written tasks
Difficulty with visual/motor-integrated sports or activities
Difficulty writing can make it harder for students to learn spelling, thus making children with dysgraphia poor spellers. It also causes students to write slowly, which can affect their ability to express themselves in writing.

It also causes students to write slowly, which can affect their ability to express themselves in writing.
Teachers can use many simple accommodations for writing to help students with dysgraphia, such as providing children with printed copies of the notes, giving students graph paper to assist with their writing, or allowing students to use an audio recorder in class. Teachers could also offer students assistive technology, ranging from simple pencil grips to keyboards, touchscreens, and dictation software. In addition to teacher accommodations, children with dysgraphia would benefit from seeing an occupational therapist.

Remember that just because a student struggles with decoding, it does not mean he or she has a language disorder. Students can struggle with decoding for many different reasons. Vision or hearing problems, a lack of prior language and literary experiences, underlying phonological awareness problems, or first language interference can each result in decoding difficulties.

Graphic Organizers
Graphic organizers are commonly used tools to support reading comprehension, literary analysis, and writing. For writing, they are primarily used as a prewriting tool to brainstorm and organize ideas before beginning a rough draft. To support reading comprehension and analysis, graphic organizers are used to scaffold student understanding by graphically representing the organization of the text. For example, a plot diagram visually represents the arc of a story as students determine the difference between rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.

The following list includes common graphic organizers and an overview of their application to reading and writing:
Venn Diagram
Venn diagrams are used to compare and contrast. They can be used in the prewriting stage for a compare and contrast essay, or they can be used to compare and analyze two different texts. You might see a Venn diagram used to compare two or more texts that share a topic but are different genres. Venn diagrams are used to compare and contrast.

T-Chart
T-Charts are also used to compare, but they do not provide a space to collect similarities. This type of graphic organizer is commonly used to plan for persuasive writing by collecting support for one argument on the first side and the opposing argument on the other side.

This type of graphic organizer is commonly used to plan for persuasive writing by collecting support for one argument on the first side and the opposing argument on the other side.
Cluster, Mind Map, or Idea Web
This type of graphic organizer is most often used as a brainstorming tool. The main idea or topic is written in the center circle, and students write their related ideas in the surrounding circles. This type of graphic organizer is most often used as a brainstorming tool. The main idea or topic is written in the center circle, and students write their related ideas in the surrounding circles.
Concept Map
Concept maps have some characteristics in common with idea webs but are more hierarchical and deliberately structured. For example, this concept map could be used to facilitate the planning of an academic essay, with the thesis statement included in the main box, and the three specific supporting ideas in the three boxes below. This type of graphic organizer is more appropriate for prewriting that occurs after a topic has been selected as opposed to the idea webs which are designed to broadly explore a concept.

Each event or each step of a process is written in a box, with additional boxes added to accommodate all parts of the series.
Cause and Effect Diagram
Similar in structure to the sequencing chart, this graphic organizer is used to reflect cause and effect relationships, not just the order of them. The versions shown here demonstrate the variety of ways information can be causally linked. For example, in the first graphic, there is one cause followed by one effect. However, the second graphic depicts a situation in which there are multiple causes of one effect, then the effect leads to multiple additional effects. Cause and effect diagrams can easily be confused with sequencing charts. It is important to consider how the information in each box is related to the information in other boxes to correctly identify this type of graphic organizer.

Linear Array
Linear arrays are used to show the degree of change between words with similar or related meaning. For example, the linear array shown below could be filled with sets of words such as: cool - cold - freezing or pleased - happy - ecstatic. Linear arrays can also be used to show the relationship between two opposite words. To do this, two opposite words are placed at both ends of the array, and words showing a gradient of meaning are placed in between. For example, a linear gradient could show: whispered - spoke - exclaimed - shouted or exhausted - tired - alert - awake.

Testing Tips for Graphic Organizer Questions
You can expect to see the following two types of graphic organizer questions:
Graphic organizer questions paired with a passage. The questions will most likely ask you to identify the graphic organizer that best visually represents the information in the passage. This essentially requires you to analyze the text's organization and connect it to a graphic organizer. Graphic organizer questions paired with a passage.
