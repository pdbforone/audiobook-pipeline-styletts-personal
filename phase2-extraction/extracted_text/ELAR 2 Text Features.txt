English language arts two text features.
Common themes in literary works.
A theme, or the core idea or message the writer would like to convey, can be implicit (suggested by the author) or explicit (stated by the author). Many novels contain multiple themes, especially for different character arcs. Many themes are universal and relatable for most people regardless of age, gender, or cultural background. Textual evidence such as the plot, character growth and interaction, and other literary devices should help identify and support a theme.
Themes, especially when universal, can be very personal. Authors from different literary periods or genres may uniquely approach the same theme due to the time they wrote their text and their individual experiences. The same goes for readers as they identify and analyze a text's theme. A theme is a subjective expression of an idea and, therefore, up for interpretation and discussion.
Theme good versus evil. Description the battle of a protagonist against an evil villain. Examples the chronicles of Narnia the Pevensie children versus the white witch. The Harry Potter series Harry Potter versus Voldemort.
Theme coming of age. Description follows one or more characters as they grow up in some manner. Examples the catcher in the rye Holden Caulfield comes to terms with growing up as he roams N Y C. A tree grows in Brooklyn Francie Nolan discovers the realities of life as she grows up in the slums of Williamsburg.
Theme peace and war. Description often discusses death, hopelessness, loss, and courage amidst a war. Examples farewell to arms lieutenant Frederic Henry navigates the Italian ambulance corps and his love for an English nurse. Slaughterhouse five an anti war story exploring the life of Billy Pilgrim and his challenging experiences during and after world war two.
Theme death and mortality. Description explores the mysteries of existence, including the inevitability of death. Examples the fault in our stars two teenage cancer patients fall in love in the face of death. The death of Ivan Ilyich the protagonist confronts his own mortality and the life he has lived.
Theme power and corruption. Description explores how power impacts individuals and society, a common theme in dystopian stories. Examples nineteen eighty four Winston Smith rebels against a totalitarian society that seeks to oppress individuality with the observations of big brother. In the time of butterflies the Mirabel sisters fight for freedom against the dictatorship of the late twentieth century Dominican Republic.
Theme love. Description can vary from romance to friends and family, but it often discusses the power of love and heartbreak. Types of love include forbidden, unrequited, sacrificial, or fated. Examples Romeo and Juliet two young lovers navigate forbidden love. Pride and prejudice the love story of Elizabeth Bennet and mister Darcy as they overcome first impressions.
Theme courage and perseverance. Description characters triumph in the face of adversity. Examples to kill a mockingbird lawyer Atticus Finch stands up against the racism of a small town as his young daughter, Scout, learns from his actions. The lord of the rings shows how even the smallest of characters, Frodo, can overcome any adversary with goodness and determination.
Theme identity and belonging. Description characters explore who they are and how they fit into society. Examples the awakening Edna Pontellier realizes her individuality as a woman but becomes alienated from society. The color purple a poor, uneducated black girl named Celie overcomes the oppression and abuse of those around her and discovers her power and individuality.
Theme forgiveness and redemption. Description characters reflect on their mistakes and strive to change. Examples the kite runner Amir confronts his past in a war torn Afghanistan in this story of friendship. Les miserables ex con Jean Valjean reforms his life and strives to help those around him, including others on their own paths to redemption.
Theme the American dream. Description a common theme of modernist and contemporary literature, these stories explore the pursuit of happiness and the contrast between expectations and reality. Examples the great Gatsby Jay Gatsby finds success in any way possible to win back his lost love and repeat the past. A raisin in the sun a black family in south Chicago attempts to improve their circumstances amidst housing discrimination, racism, and assimilation.
Other universal themes include faith versus doubt, family, fate versus free will, survival, the environment, justice, hubris, isolation.
Narrative techniques.
In narrative works, the author uses several techniques to communicate their message to the reader most effectively. These techniques typically focus on developing a plot and utilizing point of view to achieve particular effects.
Plot the five part sequence of interconnected events within the story of a narrative.
Exposition introduction of character, conflict, and setting.
Rising action complications create tension, advance the plot.
Turning point climax the point of highest tension, highest emotion, and highest interest.
Falling action clarification of events, easing of tension.
Resolution denouement concluding the story by resolving conflicts.
A plot diagram illustrating the structure of a story. It includes five labeled sections one exposition at the bottom left defined as introduces the setting, characters, and background information. Two rising action at the bottom left but slightly higher is defined as develops conflicts and builds suspense. Three climax at the top center is defined as when tension peaks in the main conflict. Four falling action at the top right is defined as resolves immediate consequences of the climax and begins the conclusion. And five resolution at the bottom right is defined as provides available closure to the conflict and outcomes. The sections are arranged in a triangular shape, with the climax at the peak. Each section is enclosed in a rectangular box. Below the triangle is a long rectangular box labeled beginning, middle, and end, lining up with the sequence of events above it.
Plot development techniques.
Backstory information about past events that explains a character's actions or motivations.
Cliffhanger an ending that leaves the reader with unanswered questions or unresolved conflict.
Deus ex machina this Latin phrase translates into god from the machine. Deus ex machina is a narrative technique in which the problem in the story is suddenly solved. This can be for comedic effect, to bring about a perfect ending, or to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem. This technique is common in dramatic works.
Flashback a shift back in time that shows earlier events or experiences.
Flashforward flashforward takes place when the narrator moves the narrative forward in time to show future events.
Foreshadowing hints or clues about what may happen later in the story.
In media res a story that begins in the middle of the action instead of at the chronological start of the events.
Denouement another term for resolution, or when all parts of the story come together to reveal the final outcome.
Point of view the perspective from which a story is narrated.
First person narrator is a character in the story.
Second person narrator is speaking to the audience.
Third person narrator is not a character in the story.
Third person omniscient narrator knows and can relate the thoughts perspectives of any character in the story.
Third person limited narrator's knowledge of thoughts perspectives is limited to those of a single character in the story.
Stream of consciousness a narration technique that presents a continuous flow of a character's thoughts and feelings. Examples of this include James Joyce's Ulysses and the Benjy Compson portion of William Faulkner's the sound and the fury.
Soliloquy a solo speech in which a character speaks their thoughts aloud, typically in drama, to reveal feelings or inner conflict to the audience.
Archetypes in literature.
Literary archetypes are story patterns that connect human beings across time, place, and culture. Such patterns can be found in the plot, setting, symbols, and characters. Carl Jung, a famed Swiss psychologist, believed that human beings have a connective unconscious that links them through time and space, and the archetypes of our stories express our natural similarities. It makes sense since many ancient cultures had no means of communication but featured similar character and plot archetypes in their storytelling, from Greek mythology to native American creation stories to African folktales.
Literary archetypes can be traced back hundreds of thousands of years to ancient texts. Over the centuries, authors have adapted them again and again. Archetypes are an essential element of literature because they allow for a universal understanding of a story, regardless of time period or culture. They also evoke strong emotions from readers because they are so familiar. Archetypes are patterns that bridge the gap between people of different cultures and remind us of our shared humanity.
When analyzing archetypes in literature, it's common to identify the archetype and its purpose in the story and to compare and contrast it with representations of the same archetype in other stories.
Character archetypes.
Archetype the hero. Description overcomes obstacles to achieve greatness. Examples king Arthur of medieval literature. Odysseus of Greek mythology. Celie of the color purple.
Archetype the wise sage. Description guides and advises the hero. Examples Athena of Greek mythology. Merlin of Arthurian legend. Obi Wan Kenobi of star wars.
Archetype the sidekick. Description faithful best friend of the protagonist. Examples Patroclus of Greek mythology. John Watson of Sherlock Holmes. Samwise of the lord of the rings.
Archetype the everyman. Description the average individual whom readers easily relate to and who evokes humility and a desire to belong. Examples Arthur Dent of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. Bilbo Baggins of the hobbit. Winston Smith of nineteen eighty four.
Archetype the villain. Description the antagonist who opposes the hero and creates conflict. Examples Iago of Othello. The evil witches of fairytales. Voldemort of Harry Potter.
Archetype the trickster. Description clever and cunning character who uses deception to achieve their goals. Examples Loki of Norse mythology. Puck of a midsummer night's dream. Coyote of native American mythology.
Archetype the outcast. Description marginalized or rejected by their community or society. Examples Hades of Greek mythology. Quasimodo of the hunchback of Notre Dame. Boo Radley of to kill a mockingbird.
Archetype the innocent. Description childlike, naive, and morally pure. Examples Scout of to kill a mockingbird. Lennie Small of of mice and men. Disney's snow white.
Archetype the creator. Description visionary who is motivated to create something new. Examples god of Christianity. Zeus of Greek mythology. Doctor Victor Frankenstein of Frankenstein.
Plot archetypes.
Archetype the quest. Description the protagonist conquers many obstacles on their journey to reach a location or goal. Examples the bible's story of Moses. The Iliad. The hobbit.
Archetype overcoming the monster. Description the hero must conquer an evil force, whether physical or metaphysical. Examples David and Goliath. Beowulf. Moby Dick.
Archetype rags to riches. Description an underdog gains something they lack (money, power, love). Examples great expectations. The prince and the pauper. Aladdin.
Archetype rebirth. Description the main character changes their ways and becomes a better person. Examples a Christmas carol. Pride and prejudice. The secret garden.
Archetype voyage and return. Description characters go to a strange, new world and return with wisdom and experience. Examples Orpheus and Eurydice. Alice in wonderland. The chronicles of Narnia.
Archetype comedy. Description humor, absurdity, and confusion eventually lead to a happy ending. Examples a midsummer night's dream. Catch twenty two. The importance of being earnest.
Archetype tragedy. Description a character flaw or fate eventually causes the protagonist's downfall. Examples Romeo and Juliet. Anna Karenina. The picture of Dorian Gray.
Types of figurative language.
Language features include elements that distinguish it, such as the choice and order of words, punctuation, definitions, semantics meaning, and function or purpose. Figurative language is one of the most common ones to analyze.
Many texts contain these figurative language choices to convey meaning alliteration repeating the first letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words. Mom made me move the mushrooms.
Hyperbole exaggeration in a statement or claim to make a point. It's raining cats and dogs.
Personification giving human characteristics to objects or animals. The moon smiled at me.
Onomatopoeia words that mimic the sound of the object or action referred to. Achoo. Boom.
Oxymoron using contradictory terms in conjunction with each other. Walking dead. Disgustingly delicious.
Symbolism when an item stands for an idea or larger meaning usually used throughout a piece of literature. Gold standard. Smoking gun.
Allusion a reference to someone or something outside of the text. You're being a Scrooge. He was a real Romeo with the ladies.
Idiom a phrase or expression that does not mean the same as the literal words. Break a leg is a way of saying good luck no one is hoping for broken limbs.
Irony an incongruity between what the reader expects the author to mean and what they actually mean. There are people who think that honesty is always the best policy. This is a superstition there are times when the appearance of it is worth six of it. This quote from Mark Twain uses a common expression, but uses it as a setup to debunk the expression.
Parable a simple story that illustrates a moral lesson. The boy who cried wolf from Aesop's fables teaches a lesson about lying.
These comparison techniques convey an idea using something familiar to the reader.
Analogy comparisons between two things, often to drive home a point. That's as useful as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.
Metaphor comparing an object or action to something else that is not literally applicable. My office is a disaster. Life is a roller coaster.
Simile comparing two things using like or as. Her skin was as soft as butter. I am as blind as a bat without my glasses.
On the exam, you might need to identify which type of figurative language is being used. The process of elimination is usually the best strategy.
Advanced figurative language.
As secondary students refine their literary analysis skills, they move beyond simply identifying figurative language to interpreting its deeper meaning and impact. They also explore more advanced figurative language choices, as seen in the table below.
By analyzing these devices in context, students can uncover layers of meaning, recognize the nuances of tone and symbolism, and appreciate the artistry behind poetic and literary expression. Understanding figurative language at this level allows students to engage more critically with texts and thoughtfully apply these techniques in their writing.
Term allegory. Definition a metaphor extended to an entire work where characters, events, or settings symbolize deeper meanings, often moral, political, or religious. Traits the symbolic meaning is carried throughout the entire story. Often teaches a lesson or critiques society. Examples the crucible by Arthur Miller. Animal farm by George Orwell.
Term allusion. Definition a reference to a well known person, event, work of literature, or cultural idea. Traits relies on shared knowledge. Can be biblical, mythological, historical, literary, or pop culture. Examples five score years ago M L K alluding to Lincoln's Gettysburg address.
Term aphorism. Definition a short, witty statement that expresses a general truth or principle. Traits often uses contrast or paradox. Memorable and philosophical. Examples an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind attributed to Gandhi.
Term apostrophe. Definition a direct address to an absent person, an abstract idea, or an inanimate object. Traits sometimes begins with oh or o. Common in poetry and drama to indicate a direct address. Examples o happy dagger this is thy sheath Romeo and Juliet.
Term antithesis. Definition a rhetorical device that places contrasting ideas side by side to highlight differences. Traits often structured in parallel syntax. Emphasizes opposition or contrast. Examples the greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time Lyndon B Johnson.
Term extended metaphor simile. Definition a comparison between two unlike things that continues throughout a passage or an entire work. Traits develops deeper meaning. Used in poetry and prose beyond just a single phrase. Examples all the world's a stage as you like it by William Shakespeare.
Term foreshadowing. Definition a clue that hints at future events in a story. Traits creates suspense or prepares the reader for what's to come. Examples Lennie killing small animals foreshadows greater violence in of mice and men.
Term hyperbole. Definition an extreme exaggeration used for emphasis or humor. Traits not meant to be taken literally. Often used in speech and poetry. Examples it was so cold the geese flew backward and the snow turned blue legend of Paul Bunyon.
Term imagery. Definition descriptive language that appeals to the senses (sight, sound, taste, touch, smell). Traits uses sensory details and figurative language to create vivid mental pictures. Examples on every rail and gate, wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick great expectations.
Term metonymy. Definition a figure of speech where something is referred to by an associated object (or part of a whole). Traits commonly used in rhetoric and literature. Examples the white house issued a statement, where the white house refers to the united states government.
Term parallelism. Definition the repetition of grammatical structures in phrases or clauses for rhythm and emphasis. Traits creates a sense of balance, clarity, and persuasive impact. Examples ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country J F K.
Term personification. Definition giving human traits to inanimate, non living objects. Traits makes description more vivid and relatable. Can make abstract concepts more concrete. Examples because I could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me the carriage held but just ourselves and immortality Emily Dickinson.
Term repetition. Definition deliberately reusing words, phrases, or structures to emphasize a point. Traits strengthens impact and rhythm. Common in speeches and poetry. Examples I have a dream Martin Luther King junior.
Term rhetorical question. Definition a question asked for effect rather than to get an actual answer. Traits encourages thought, persuasion, or emphasis. Examples what's in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet Romeo and Juliet.
Example question.
A red, red rose by Robert Burns.
O my luve is like a red, red rose that's newly sprung in June o my luve is like the melody that's sweetly played in tune.
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass, so deep in luve am I and I will luve thee still, my dear, till a the seas gang dry.
Till a the seas gang dry, my dear, and the rocks melt with the sun I will love thee still, my dear, while the sands of life shall run.
And fare thee weel, my only luve and fare thee weel awhile and I will come again, my luve, though it were ten thousand mile.
How does the use of hyperbole contribute to the theme of the poem?
A it exaggerates the lover's feelings for a comical effect.
B it exaggerates the lover's feelings to demonstrate how much he feels for her.
C the heavily descriptive language paints a visual image of love in the reader's mind.
D it conveys a dual meaning about the narrator's love.
Answer choice explanations.
For this question, you need to assess the use of a specific figurative language device hyperbole. Remember that hyperbole is an exaggeration used for effect. That automatically makes the correct answer either choice A or B.
Read the answer options and consider which point the poet is trying to make is he humorous or sincere? The best interpretation is choice B.
Choice C is a definition of imagery, not hyperbole. Choice D is incorrect because hyperboles are not figurative devices that convey two meanings.
Skill box identify tone.
Tone is the author's attitude toward the subject he or she is writing about. This literary term is often confused with mood, which is how the excerpt makes the reader feel. The tone of a literary piece may be ironic, arrogant, sentimental, or humorous, to name a few. Depending on the type of text, the tone will vary widely.
Identify tone recognize it.
You will notice the questions asking the reader to identify tone are structured similarly. They are straightforward, asking directly what the tone is or identifying the author's attitude.
The writer's attitude toward X is.
The tone of the passage is.
The author's attitude is.
Identify tone tips.
Remember the difference between tone and mood. Sometimes, a distractor answer choice identifying the piece's mood will confuse you.
Focus on determining whether the words in the piece have a mostly positive or negative connotation. For example, if the piece contains the words immature and disappointing, the piece most likely has a more negative tone.
Example question.
Read the excerpt from birches by Robert Frost and answer the question that follows.
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snow crust such heaps of broken glass to sweep away you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long, they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground, like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter of fact about the ice storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows some boy too far from town to learn baseball, whose only play was what he found himself, summer or winter, and could play alone.
The writer's attitude toward the boy is A sorrowful. B sympathetic. C casual. D pitiful.
Answer choice explanations.
Choice B is the correct answer because the writer has a positive attitude towards the boy, and sympathetic is the only tone word choice with a positive connotation. The author notes he would prefer to have some boy bend them (the birch trees), with prefer illustrating his positive view of the boy. The fact that the boy could play alone impresses the author. However, the author ultimately feels sympathy for the boy because he lives too far from town to learn baseball and has to find his own fun and places to play. Choices A and D have a negative connotation, and answer choice C has a neutral connotation.
Skill box author's use of literary devices.
Literary devices can encompass a wide range of stylistic tools authors use to convey meaning to the reader. The following terms refer to the same set of stylistic conventions authors use in their writing literary devices, stylistic choices, figurative language, and poetic devices. When these terms are used, they could refer to devices like metaphor, simile, analogy, imagery, alliteration, personification, repetition, onomatopoeia, hyperbole.
Author's use of literary devices recognize it.
Analyzing how and why an author uses a literary device is a complex task. It goes beyond simply defining the device you must also be able to explain its intent, considering the text and its purpose. Question stems you may come across include which of the following sentences describes how a literary device is used in X? Which of the following statements most accurately describes how X uses figurative language in X? In the text, X uses figurative language and imagery to discover which of the following themes? Which statement below most closely describes how X uses figurative language to develop characterization in X? In the X sentence of the excerpt, X uses an analogy to show the meaning of which word from the excerpt? Which sentence most closely describes the author's use of a literary device in this excerpt? Which of the following most accurately describes the author's reasoning for including the X sentence in this passage?
Author's use of literary devices tips.
After reading the excerpt and the question, read the excerpt again, noting the author's stylistic moves.
Consider why the author chose to use that particular literary device.
Think about the meaning and intent behind why the author included that literary device.
Ask yourself how is this excerpt improved with the inclusion of this device?
Author's use of literary devices example.
Example question.
An excerpt from birches by Robert Frost.
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snow crust such heaps of broken glass to sweep away you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long, they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground, like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter of fact about the ice storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows some boy too far from town to learn baseball, whose only play was what he found himself, summer or winter, and could play alone.
Which sentence most closely describes the author's use of a literary device in this excerpt?
A Frost personifies the ice left over from the ice storm as it shatters, falls off the trees, and lands on the ground to melt away.
B Frost uses a simile to compare the boy's play options in a nearby town with the country setting in which he now finds himself.
C Frost sets up an extended metaphor between the changing nature of the trees and the human life cycle from birth to death.
D Frost personifies the birch trees in the forest by comparing their movements after the ice storm with human characteristics.
Answer choice explanations.
Choice D is the correct answer because the movements of the birch trees are personified and can be compared to human characteristics. The trees shed and are bowed in one position for a long period. Frost makes this choice to make the trees more human like to the reader.
Choices A, B, and C each describe literary devices not present in the excerpt. In choice A, ice shatters, falls, and melts, making the description not personified. There is no simile as described in choice B. For choice C, there is no mention or description of the human life cycle in the excerpt.
Skill box analyze imagery.
When analyzing and making meaning of literature, you will often be asked to examine the author's use of imagery closely. Imagery often contributes significantly to the effect and meaning of works across all genres.
Sensory imagery is the use of vivid language to appeal to the five senses sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. This includes sensory words, descriptive phrases, and figurative language.
Not only does evocative imagery keep the reader engaged, but imagery also contributes significantly to the work's mood, impact, and theme. Analyzing imagery involves identifying sensory language, categorizing it, and explaining how it contributes to the meaning of the work as a whole.
Visual imagery includes words describing everything we can see colors, shapes, light, and shadow. It is the most commonly used type of imagery because over eighty percent of sensory information for most humans is visual.
Auditory imagery includes words describing the sounds in a scene or passage. Consider how words or phrases describing the sounds of chirping birds, the howling or the wind, or the booming of cannons could contribute to the mood or meaning of a work.
The other three senses touch, taste, and smell show up less often in literature but can effectively convey a mood or theme. They are respectively called tactile imagery, gustatory imagery, and olfactory imagery.
Once you have identified the sensory language, your task is to consider why the author chose to use these specific phrases in this particular passage. In other words, it is not enough to simply quote examples of imagery and say that the author has used visual imagery to paint a picture in the reader's mind. Instead, consider how the imagery contributes to the tone of the passage, aligns with the overall mood of the scene, creates an effect such as building suspense, helps develop the author's theme.
Sensory categories are just one of the ways to group imagery. Literary analysis may involve noticing that the author has created a pattern of using words that you can group together. You might encounter the need for phrases such as nature imagery, religious imagery, or cooking imagery.
Notice these patterns and whether they are literal or metaphorical descriptions. Consider how the author's language use contributes to the passage's mood, effect, or theme.
Analyze imagery recognize it.
Look for these kinds of question stems which of the following is an example of X imagery? What sensory imagery is most prevalent in this passage? Which of the following best describes the mood created by imagery in this passage? Which of the following best describes the theme conveyed by imagery in this passage?
Analyze imagery tips.
Pay particular attention to descriptive sections of the text, but remember imagery can appear anywhere.
Remember, not all details are imagery. Look for vivid words and phrases that stimulate the senses.
Notice sensory language and consider which of the five senses it engages.
Consider the type of sensory language the author uses and the most emphasized sense.
Analyze imagery example.
Read the excerpt from the tell tale heart and answer the questions.
When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing the lie down, I resolved to open a little a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
It was open wide, wide open and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the sense? Now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme. It grew louder, I say, louder every moment do you mark me well?
Which of the following is an example of visual imagery?
A it increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
B there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
C it was open wide, wide open and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.
D a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
Choice D is the correct answer, considering the five senses and using the process of elimination. The phrase paints a vivid image of a very thin ray of light on the old man's eye.
The other choices are not as strong.
A the beating of the drum is an example of auditory imagery.
B a watch's low, dull sound is another example of auditory imagery. It has a very different impact than choice A.
C this line mentions an open door and the narrator gazing at the old man's eye, but it is not a strong example of visual imagery.
Which of the following best states the effect created by Poe's use of imagery in this passage?
A the author uses bird imagery to create an envious mood.
B the author builds suspense and creates a foreboding mood.
C the author builds an extended metaphor about a spider and its web.
D the author uses war imagery to create a triumphant mood.
Using the process of elimination, choice B is the correct answer. The variety of vivid details in the passage as the narrator opens the door and approaches the old man helps build suspense and create the foreboding mood as the narrator sneaks into the old man's room and hopes he does not wake up. The thread of light on his eye and the sound of a beating heart grows from a dull watch to a beating drum on the battlefield.
The other choices are not as strong.
A the author does mention a vulture eye, but there isn't a pattern of bird imagery. Foreboding describes the mood more accurately than envious.
C this passage has no pattern of spider imagery or an extended web metaphor.
D the author briefly mentions a battlefield drum and a soldier, which does not contribute to a triumphant mood.
Skill analyzing characters, setting, and plot.
You may need to read an excerpt of a story and analyze one of the following characters, setting, or plot.
Recognizing question stems.
What can you conclude about?
How does the setting affect?
Core concepts.
Characters.
Who is in the story? Is there a problem that needs to be solved? Is someone trying to achieve or receive something?
What is the character's role in the story? What relationships do they have with other characters? How does the character influence the plot?
What was the character's motivation for a specific action?
How did the character change or develop during a passage? Think about their personality traits, mood, and so on.
You might see direct characterization clear explanations of a character (he was six feet tall with a long, scraggly beard).
Indirect characterization the reader has to interpret and draw a conclusion (he looked like a sasquatch).
Setting.
Setting can describe where the story takes place both the location and the social climate.
When the story takes place.
How does the setting impact the characters plot theme?
Plot.
What's happening? Is there a problem that needs to be solved? Is someone trying to achieve or receive something?
How does the plot impact the character theme?
Is there any conflict?
Character versus character.
Character versus society.
Character versus nature.
Character versus technology.
Strategies for success.
Focus only on the information presented in the passage. Do not answer based on what you may know about the story from prior readings, film adaptations, or other common knowledge you bring to the test.
Use the passage as a whole to choose an answer unless the question specifically asks you to focus on one detail or line.
Example question one.
The following is the opening of a case of identity by sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
My dear fellow, said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker street, life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man can invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction, with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions, most stale and unprofitable.
And yet I am not convinced of it, I answered. The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.
A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect, remarked Holmes. This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.
What can you conclude about Sherlock Holmes' character after reading this passage?
A Sherlock Holmes finds police reports lacking in detail.
B Sherlock Holmes enjoys the narrator's company.
C Sherlock Holmes is very intelligent.
D Sherlock Holmes is unimpressed by unusual or extraordinary occurrences.
Answer choice explanations.
What do we know or learn about Sherlock Holmes as a person after reading this excerpt? The complex phrasing in the dialogue shows he is intelligent, making choice C the best option. The other answer choices do not assess Sherlock Holmes' character.
Choice A rephrases his opinion on police reports. This answer may be true, but it is not what the question asks.
Choice B, again, has little to do with Sherlock's character. Be careful not to assume answers based on what you may know about the story use only the passage provided. There is little in this selection to indicate whether Holmes likes or dislikes the narrator.
Choice D seems contrary to the presented opinion and does not assess his character.
Example question two.
Based on the passage's setting, what can we assume about the relationship between the narrator and Holmes?
A this is the first time they've met.
B these meetings are a frequent occurrence.
C the narrator is distrustful of Sherlock Holmes.
D the narrator is impressed by Holmes' wealth and living standard.
Answer choice explanations.
This passage provides a very brief description of the setting. We know the two characters are sitting near a fire in Holmes' residence. Using this brevity, we can infer that the setting is not unknown to the narrator he's so used to the home that he doesn't take any time to describe it to the reader or notice any unusual details about the place. B would be the best answer choice.
To eliminate the other options, consider the following.
Choice A a first encounter would likely include a more detailed setting description.
Choice C a distrustful narrator might stand or sit further away from Holmes, not near him or by a fire.
Choice D there is no indication that Sherlock Holmes is wealthy nor that his lodging is impressively decorated.

Example question.
Read the excerpt from the glossary in exploring figurative language, a middle school textbook that introduces students to literary devices used in poetry and prose.
Metaphor a figure of speech that compares two unlike things without using like or as (e g, the classroom was a zoo).
Personification giving human traits to non human things (e g, the wind whispered through the trees).
Hyperbole an extreme exaggeration used for emphasis (e g, I've told you a million times).
Alliteration the repetition of the same consonant sound at the beginning of words (e g, Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers).
How does the glossary contribute to communicating the central idea of the textbook?
A helping readers understand key literary terms that support the textbook's lessons.
B providing a summary of the textbook's main argument about figurative language.
C illustrating visual examples of figurative language.
D listing famous authors who use figurative language in their works.
Answer choice explanations.
Choice B is incorrect because a glossary does not summarize the textbook's main argument, which is typically found in the introduction or main text. Next, while examples are included, this glossary does not illustrate visual examples, so choice C is also incorrect. Choice D is the wrong answer since a glossary focuses on definitions instead of the authors who use them. Therefore, choice A is correct because the glossary defines important literary devices, helping students understand the textbook's lessons on figurative language.
Skill box word choice.
Analyzing word choice typically requires you to look at these features tone, relation of a phrase to the overall idea.
Word choice recognize it.
Look for these kinds of question stems which of the following best describes the tone of the third sentence? Which of the following best describes how the language is used to. The author probably mentions X in order to.
Word choice tips.
First, identify the primary purpose of writing. The author's word choices will likely support this.
Think of how the connotation of the given word affects the tone.
Look at the surrounding sentences or the paragraph as a whole to see how this word impacts those areas of the passage.
Example question one.
Read the passage and answer the question that follows.
Excerpt from inaugural address by John F Kennedy, January twentieth, nineteen sixty one.
One in your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.
Two now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need not as a call to battle, though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation a struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.
Three can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, north and south, east and west, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?
Four in the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.
Five and so, my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.
Six my fellow citizens of the world ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
Seven finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that here on earth god's work must truly be our own.
Which of the following best describes the tone of the passage?
A empowered.
B defeated.
C worried.
D casual.
Answer choice explanations.
When assessing tone, think about how you feel after reading the passage. Even though Kennedy mentions some grave or dire subject matter, the overall feeling is spirited and hopeful. Choice A, empowered, is the correct answer.
The other options focus too narrowly on specific points of the selection.
Choice B Kennedy mentions being at war against tyranny, poverty, and disease, but he is confident that the American people can overcome these obstacles.
Choice C Kennedy welcomes the responsibility to defend freedom and is not worried that his countrymen will fail him.
Choice D words like summoned, embattled, endeavor, or sacrifice are not generally used casually.
Example question two.
Read the passage and answer the question that follows.
Some earth changing events occur naturally, but others come from us, from humans. It's important to remember that we each have our own impact on the earth. In many cases, humans influence the earth's natural processes on purpose, speeding them up, slowing them down, or manipulating them in other ways to get something we want usually a natural resource, like oil. Some of what we do to our planet is on purpose, and some of it is accidental. Cutting down forests, building new houses, bridges, office buildings and movie theaters, are just a few of the projects that can lead to quickening natural events that might have taken much longer without humans' involvement. Ultimately, the future of the earth is in our hands.
The author probably mentions that the future of earth is in our hands in the last sentence in order to A inform readers about examples of natural events. B encourage readers to start recycling. C inform readers that using oil causes environmental problems. D inform readers of their impact on the earth and encourage them to take action.
Answer choice explanations.
In this example, you are evaluating why the author used a phrase. Think, what was his primary purpose of writing? In this example, the author explains that human actions can affect earth. This clause is at the very end and functions as a call to action. Therefore, choice D is best.
The other choices are not as strong.
Choice A the writer discusses natural events. However, he does not provide examples.
Choice B the author does not mention recycling. This might be a good answer to a question asking you to predict the idea of the following paragraph.
Choice C this is a tempting choice. Oil does appear in the passage, but this is a supporting detail for the author's main idea. This question wants you to decide how the author used the phrase the future of earth is in our hands, so choice D is best.
