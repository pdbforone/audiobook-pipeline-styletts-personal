Data gained from an assessment is only as good as the assessment itself. Teachers should be careful when designing assessments to ensure that students are given the best possible chance to show their understanding of the material. Assessments are fair if they measure student learning appropriately. To ensure assessments are fair, teachers should focus on these four key points.

Freedom from bias test items should not offend or penalize students due to their background or culture. Considering student diversity is essential when considering potential bias in an assessment. Teachers cannot assume students have the background knowledge needed to fully understand questions they may encounter. For example, students may not be adequately prepared to answer a word problem about an airport if they've never been to one before. This ties back into assessments being valid and clear.

Teachers have many responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is maintaining accurate student records. There are many purposes of records. Records can keep track of student attendance, assignments, and grades. They can monitor student academic or behavioral progress and keep a record of communication with students' families. They can even help teachers keep track of the effectiveness of different instructional methods. Teachers have many responsibilities.

They can even help teachers keep track of the effectiveness of different instructional methods.
Rules, expectations, and regulations regarding records depend on the state and school district, but the general expectations of accuracy and confidentiality are universal. Furthermore, all student records should be passed on through official channels (like the school's administrative office) following the school year. If this option is not available, the teacher is required to maintain these records for seven years, after which they can be discarded.

Matching assessments to lesson objectives. Matching assessments to lesson objectives.
When selecting or creating assessments, teachers should match the assessment to the objective and skills they are teaching. This helps ensure students are evaluated fairly using valid assessments and helps teachers plan appropriate future instruction to meet students' needs. To align assessments to the lesson or unit objectives, teachers should ask themselves the following questions does this assessment include any concepts that have not been taught. Does the assessment match the way I presented this topic to students. What level of understanding am I trying to assess (comprehension, application, analysis, for instance). Do the tasks on the assessment align with this level of understanding. Is this assessment appropriate for the students' age or grade level. Will this assessment allow me to determine if students have met the learning objective. Will this assessment help guide future instruction.

A well created assessment will cover the same concepts that were taught, assess them in a way that is similar to how it was taught, and match the anticipated level of student understanding. For example, a lesson with an objective stating students will describe main characters by their physical traits, actions, and feelings could be assessed by reading a book aloud to students and having them list words describing the main character. A poorly designed assessment might instead ask students to identify the main and supporting characters in a book and describe the story's setting.

Other important assessment terms include progress monitoring periodic assessments given to keep track of student growth toward a specific goal or objective. Curriculum based assessment measures student progress using materials taken directly from the curriculum. Performance based assessment students apply knowledge or skills to complete a process or create a product. Typically requires high order thinking. Typically scored with a rubric or checklist. Portfolio a collection of student work to show growth over time. Students often select their own pieces and include self reflection. Typically scored with a rubric or checklist. Exit slip short response completed and submitted at the end of a lesson. Example students use a new vocabulary word in a sentence and turn it in before leaving class or transitioning to the next subject. Rubric a tool that outlines specific criteria for evaluating or grading work, providing clear expectations and standards for performance. Analytic rubrics individually assess each part of the assignment with multiple graded categories. On a writing assessment with analytic scoring, grammar, spelling, and content would be graded separately, and the scores combined to find an overall score. Holistic rubrics evaluate the quality of the piece as a whole. The rubric has one score and is very general. Students use self assessment rubrics to evaluate their own work according to set criteria.

Assessment data can be viewed at different levels individual student performance or class trends. Looking at group data reveals overall strengths and weaknesses of the class in reading, writing, vocabulary, or fluency. For example, a standardized reading assessment might indicate a large portion of the class struggles with inferential thinking. Individual data, such as reading inventories or writing rubrics, pinpoints specific areas where students might need additional support, such as identifying a student struggling with decoding short vowel sounds.

The most effective approach targets the identified weakness directly. By designing a mini lesson that incorporates explicit instruction, modeling, graphic organizers, and practice with various texts, students gain the necessary skills and opportunities to develop their ability to identify main ideas independently. Matching pre determined main ideas to texts while offering exposure doesn't teach them how to find them within the text itself. While independent reading is valuable, struggling students might require more explicit instruction before relying solely on independent practice. Finally, moving on to a new unit without addressing the gap in understanding would likely create further difficulties for students as they encounter more complex texts.

The most effective intervention directly addresses the student's specific decoding difficulties. Implementing explicit instruction in sound manipulation, blending sounds to form words, and providing practice reading decodable texts focusing on C V C words equips the student with the necessary phonics skills and targeted practice opportunities to improve their decoding abilities. Introducing leveled readers with more complex vocabulary would be counterproductive for a student struggling with foundational skills like C V C decoding. Partnering the student with a stronger reader for incidental learning might not provide the necessary level of support. Finally, focusing solely on fluency activities like repeated reading wouldn't address the core problem of struggling with decoding C V C words.
