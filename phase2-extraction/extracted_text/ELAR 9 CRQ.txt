Mister Flint was hard pushed for house servants, and rather than lose me he had restrained his malice. I did my work faithfully, though not, of course, with a willing mind. They were evidently afraid I should leave them but now that I was certain my children were to be put in their power, in order to give them a stronger hold on me, I resolved to leave them that night. I remembered the grief this step would bring upon my dear old grandmother, and nothing less than the freedom of my children would have induced me to disregard her advice. I went about my evening work with trembling steps. Mister Flint twice called from his chamber door to inquire why the house was not locked up. I replied that I had not done my work. You have had time enough to do it, said he. Take care how you answer me. Mister Flint was hard pushed for house servants, and rather than lose me he had restrained his malice.

One strategy to help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the new content is to use a Venn diagram activity. This activity would involve comparing and contrasting the student's experiences or familiar scenarios with the situations faced by Linda in the text. For instance, the teacher could ask the student to think about a time when they felt pressured or controlled by someone else, and how they responded to that situation. By drawing parallels between their own experiences and Linda's struggle with mister Flint, the student can better understand the emotional and psychological aspects of the character interactions.

The student demonstrates a need to develop a deeper understanding of how specific actions and dialogue contribute to the development of the plot. While the student correctly identifies the general impact of character interactions on the plot, there is a need to delve into the nuances of how specific actions by mister Flint create tension and drive Linda's decisions.

While the student correctly identifies the general impact of character interactions on the plot, there is a need to delve into the nuances of how specific actions by mister Flint create tension and drive Linda's decisions.
To address this need, I would use a close reading strategy combined with a graphic organizer. This involves guiding the student to read the text multiple times, each time with a different focus. For the first reading, the student would focus on understanding the general plot and character dynamics. During the second reading, the focus would shift to identifying specific actions and dialogue that reveal character traits and motivations. The third reading would involve annotating the text to note how these actions and dialogue pieces influence Linda's decisions and the plot's progression.

The graphic organizer will help the student track their thinking as they read. The organizer might include columns for listing specific actions or dialogue, character traits revealed by these actions, and the resulting impact on the plot. This visual aid supports the student in organizing their thoughts and seeing connections more clearly. The graphic organizer will help the student track their thinking as they read.

This strategy is developmentally appropriate because it scaffolds the student's understanding, allowing them to build on their initial comprehension and progressively deepen their analysis. By breaking down the reading into manageable parts and providing clear objectives for each reading, the student can more effectively analyze the text.

By breaking down the reading into manageable parts and providing clear objectives for each reading, the student can more effectively analyze the text.
One developmentally appropriate method of assessment to monitor the student's progress is the use of an analytical rubric for their written literary analysis. The rubric would evaluate specific criteria such as the identification of character traits, the analysis of character interactions, the use of textual evidence, and the clarity of inferences made. Each criterion would be rated on a scale (e g, one to four), providing detailed feedback on the student's strengths and areas for improvement.

Additionally, incorporating a metacognitive activity will enhance the assessment. After completing their analysis, the student can reflect on their learning process by answering questions such as what strategies helped you understand the text better. How did the graphic organizer aid your analysis. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them. Additionally, incorporating a metacognitive activity will enhance the assessment.

How did the graphic organizer aid your analysis. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them.
Data from the analytical rubric and metacognitive reflections can be used to measure the student's progress by identifying patterns in their performance. For example, if the student consistently scores lower in the use of textual evidence, the teacher can plan targeted instruction to improve this skill, such as mini lessons on finding and integrating quotes effectively. Additionally, the teacher can use this data to adjust the difficulty of future texts, provide additional practice opportunities, and set specific goals for the student's growth.

To help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the new content in the excerpt from incidents in the life of a slave girl, I would use a strategy called text to self connections. This strategy encourages students to relate the characters and events in the text to their own experiences. For instance, I would ask the student to think about a time when they felt scared but had to act bravely, similar to Linda's situation. This connection helps the student empathize with Linda and understand her motivations more deeply.

This strategy encourages students to relate the characters and events in the text to their own experiences. For instance, I would ask the student to think about a time when they felt scared but had to act bravely, similar to Linda's situation. This connection helps the student empathize with Linda and understand her motivations more deeply.
One area of academic need that the student demonstrates is the ability to address minor errors in their writing. While the student identifies relevant quotes and makes inferences, their explanations sometimes lack precision and clarity. Addressing these errors will enhance the student's ability to communicate their ideas more effectively.

While the student identifies relevant quotes and makes inferences, their explanations sometimes lack precision and clarity. Addressing these errors will enhance the student's ability to communicate their ideas more effectively.
To address this need, I would use the mini lesson on editing for clarity strategy. This strategy involves brief, focused lessons that teach students how to identify and correct minor errors in their writing. Here's how it works identify common errors review the student's work to identify frequent minor errors, such as unclear explanations or misused punctuation. Teach correction strategies provide a mini lesson on how to correct these errors. For example, if the student often misuses commas, the lesson could focus on the correct use of commas in complex sentences. Practice editing have the student practice editing sentences or short paragraphs, focusing on the specific errors addressed in the lesson.

For example, I might teach the student to revise a sentence like, Linda is scared but brave, she decides to escape. To although Linda is scared, she bravely decides to escape. This revision addresses the comma splice and improves clarity. For example, I might teach the student to revise a sentence like, Linda is scared but brave, she decides to escape.

To monitor the student's progress toward addressing punctuation errors, I would use formative assessments such as peer editing sessions. After a lesson, I would pair the student with a classmate to exchange and review each other's work, focusing on the specific types of errors addressed in the mini lesson.

Completion the response addresses all parts of the assignment but does so only partially. While it is true that the student's writing includes minor errors, those errors do not detract from the meaning of the text. As was noted in the student teacher discussion, the student could use support in developing more relevant skills such as consistently providing evidence from the text to support their inferences. Suggestions for both strategies and assessments are rudimentary. Completion the response addresses all parts of the assignment but does so only partially.

Application of content the response demonstrates a partially accurate, partially effective application of the relevant content knowledge and skills. For example, while appropriate syntax and careful punctuation are important skills, it is not the student's most relevant academic need within the context of drawing inferences. The instructional strategy could lead to a student making more careful choices, but the response needs to include specifics about how to engage the student in the mini lessons in a way that will lead to their improvement. Further, while peer evaluation can be an effective monitoring strategy, the response needs to again provide specifics about how the teacher would scaffold the approach to peer evaluation so that students engage it in a way that will improve their writing.

Support the response provides limited evidence and examples or explanations, when provided, may be only partially appropriate. Having students remember a time when they had to be brave does connect the text to prior knowledge, but the simplicity of fear versus bravery does not adequately address the threat to the main character's life nor the fact that her choice may endanger her children, as well. Similarly, providing mini lessons on grammar and syntax does not explicitly support the learning objective of using textual evidence to make inferences.

The teacher assigns students to read the excerpt below from Abraham Lincoln's the Gettysburg address, a speech delivered on November nineteenth, eighteen sixty three, to commemorate the establishment of a new national cemetery after the battle of Gettysburg.
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Can you identify who Lincoln was directly addressing at the beginning of his speech.
Student Lincoln was addressing the audience gathered at the dedication of the Gettysburg national cemetery. He begins by referencing our fathers. I think he's talking about the founding fathers who established the nation. This connects with the audience at Gettysburg because they are honoring the soldiers who died there to preserve that nation.

To help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the content in Lincoln's Gettysburg address, I would use the strategy of linking historical context to present day issues. For example, I could ask the student to think about recent speeches or events that commemorate significant sacrifices, such as memorial day or September eleventh memorials. Discussing how these modern events reflect similar themes of honor, sacrifice, and national unity can help students draw parallels between the past and present.

The student demonstrates proficiency in identifying Lincoln's overarching purpose, to honor those who died in battle, while also urging the nation to stay united and committed to its founding principles. However, the analysis lacks a clear understanding of the specific audience and how Lincoln's choices appeal to that audience. The student uses inclusive pronouns such as we and us to refer to the audience, as if Lincoln had been targeting his message to all Americans throughout time. The lack of specificity in identifying the audience results in an attempt at analysis that mostly interprets Lincoln's words rather than analyzing his choices. In the conversation with the teacher, it is clear that the student is capable of doing stronger analysis when encouraged to think about a specific audience.

To address this need, I would use a strategy called close reading with historical context. This involves reading the text closely while integrating background knowledge about the Gettysburg address's immediate context. Providing primary source materials such as letters from soldiers who fought in the battle, newspaper articles from the time, or photographs of the Gettysburg dedication can enrich the student's understanding of the audience and setting. Multimedia resources like documentaries or dramatizations of the speech can also help students visualize the historical context.

A formative assessment strategy I would use is the think pair share method. After providing background information and multimedia resources, I would ask students to think about and write down their thoughts on how Lincoln's language specifically addresses the audience at Gettysburg. Then, they would pair up with a classmate to discuss their ideas before sharing with the larger group. This method encourages active engagement and allows the teacher to gauge the students' understanding in real time. A formative assessment strategy I would use is the think pair share method.

Using data from the think pair share activity, I would look for evidence of students' ability to identify and analyze Lincoln's specific audience. This includes noting whether they reference the immediate audience at Gettysburg and how they connect Lincoln's language to this audience. If students show a strong understanding, I can move on to more complex analysis tasks. If not, I can provide additional support, such as more targeted discussions or supplementary materials to reinforce their comprehension.

To help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the new content and contexts in the excerpt provided, one strategy would be to encourage the student to think about modern speeches they have heard in their lifetime. Asking the student to consider speeches by contemporary leaders and the messages they convey can create a bridge between their prior knowledge and the historical context of Lincoln's Gettysburg address. This strategy would help students understand that speeches often serve to unite people and address significant societal issues.

An area of academic need demonstrated by the student relates to their understanding of the specific historical context of Lincoln's speech. While the student identifies Lincoln's purpose and general audience, they need a deeper comprehension of how the historical context influences the speech's content and delivery. This gap indicates a need for more background knowledge about the civil war and the significance of the battle of Gettysburg.

To address this need, a developmentally appropriate instructional strategy could involve having the student watch a full length movie about Abraham Lincoln and the civil war. Students like to watch movies, so they would be more likely to pay attention to the information rather than listening to the teacher lecture. I would include a viewing guide to make sure that all of the students were paying attention.

Furthermore, a multiple choice test can check the student's recall of historical facts however, it does not measure their ability to analyze Lincoln's purpose and audience within the speech. Multiple choice tests are often limited to surface level understanding and may not reflect the student's analytical skills or depth of comprehension. Additionally, this approach does not provide insights into the student's ability to apply historical knowledge to their analysis of the speech. Therefore, while it offers a general indication of the student's recall abilities, it does not inform how well the student can connect historical context to Lincoln's rhetorical strategies.

Oh my dear mister Bennet, as Mrs Bennet entered the room, we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked and mister Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of that, my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her. But, however, he did not admire her at all indeed, nobody can, you know and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger.

If he had had any compassion for me, cried her husband, mister Bennet, impatiently, he would not have danced half so much. For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance. If he had had any compassion for me, cried her husband, mister Bennet, impatiently, he would not have danced half so much.

In Jane Austen's pride and prejudice, the historical context of early nineteenth century England greatly influences the characters and the plot. Back then, social status and marriage were super important, especially for women, which is clear in how the characters act and what they care about.

Mrs Bennet's excitement after the ball shows how much pressure there was to make good marriages. She is thrilled that mister Bingley admired Jane, talking endlessly about how he danced with her twice and seemed really interested. Her happiness is all about the idea that a wealthy man might marry her daughter, which would be a big deal for their family.

On the other hand, mister Bennet's reaction to his wife's excitement shows a different attitude. He gets impatient and even jokes that he wishes mister Bingley had sprained his ankle to avoid dancing so much. This suggests that mister Bennet is tired of all the social games and doesn't take them as seriously as his wife does.

Student well, back then, women didn't have many options for independence. They needed to marry well to secure their future. Mrs Bennet knows this, so she's really eager to see her daughters married off to wealthy men like mister Bingley. Student well, back then, women didn't have many options for independence.

Teacher exactly. Her concerns are rooted in the social and economic realities of the time. It's important to include that thinking in your essay. Right now, you've stated that social status and marriage were super important to nineteenth century women, but you haven't explained why. How does the pressure to marry well shape the plot and the actions of other characters, like Jane or mister Bennet. Teacher exactly.

Student for Jane, it means that she has to present herself well and catch mister Bingley's eye, which she does successfully at the ball. For mister Bennet, though, he seems more relaxed and even mocks the whole process, showing that he's not as stressed about the social expectations as his wife is.

One effective strategy to help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the new content in pride and prejudice is to use a comparative analysis approach. This strategy involves comparing the historical context of the novel to contemporary social norms and expectations regarding marriage and social status. By drawing parallels between the nineteenth century setting of the novel and present day societal norms, the student can better understand the motivations and actions of the characters.

By drawing parallels between the nineteenth century setting of the novel and present day societal norms, the student can better understand the motivations and actions of the characters.
For instance, the teacher can initiate a class discussion on how societal expectations regarding marriage and social status have evolved over time. Students can share their own experiences or observations about the pressures and expectations related to marriage in their communities. This discussion will help students relate personally to the content and recognize the universality of certain social themes, thereby deepening their comprehension of the text.

The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the historical context and its impact on characterization. However, there is a need for the student to include more specific textual evidence to support their claims. The analysis lacks detailed references to the text, which are crucial for substantiating the points made about the characters and their actions. Further, the analysis would benefit from a clearer explanation of why marriage and social status were an important societal value for women in the nineteenth century.

To address the identified need, the teacher can implement a close reading strategy. This strategy involves guiding the student to carefully examine specific passages of the text to identify and analyze key details that support their claims. During close reading sessions, the teacher can prompt the student with questions that direct their attention to relevant quotes and details that illustrate the historical context and its influence on the characters. To address the identified need, the teacher can implement a close reading strategy. This strategy involves guiding the student to carefully examine specific passages of the text to identify and analyze key details that support their claims. During close reading sessions, the teacher can prompt the student with questions that direct their attention to relevant quotes and details that illustrate the historical context and its influence on the characters.
For example, the teacher can ask the student to identify quotes that showcase Mrs Bennet's obsession with securing advantageous marriages for her daughters, such as her excitement over mister Bingley dancing with Jane. Similarly, the teacher can prompt the student to find evidence of mister Bennet's cynicism, such as his impatient remarks about the ball. This focused analysis will help the student develop a habit of supporting their interpretations with specific textual evidence.

This focused analysis will help the student develop a habit of supporting their interpretations with specific textual evidence.
A suitable method of assessment to monitor the student's progress toward the identified skill is a written response that requires the student to integrate specific textual evidence into their analysis. The assessment prompt could ask the student to revise their initial analysis, incorporating at least three direct quotes from the text that illustrate how the historical context influences the characters and plot.

The assessment prompt could ask the student to revise their initial analysis, incorporating at least three direct quotes from the text that illustrate how the historical context influences the characters and plot.
For example, the prompt could be revise your literary analysis of pride and prejudice by including at least three direct quotes from the text that demonstrate how the historical context of early nineteenth century England influences the actions and attitudes of Mrs Bennet and mister Bennet. For example, the prompt could be revise your literary analysis of pride and prejudice by including at least three direct quotes from the text that demonstrate how the historical context of early nineteenth century England influences the actions and attitudes of Mrs Bennet and mister Bennet.
The data from this written assessment will provide valuable insights into the student's ability to support their claims with textual evidence. By comparing the revised analysis with the initial response, the teacher can evaluate the student's improvement in incorporating specific details from the text. If the student successfully integrates relevant quotes and provides a more detailed analysis, it indicates progress in their analytical skills.

If the student successfully integrates relevant quotes and provides a more detailed analysis, it indicates progress in their analytical skills.
Based on the assessment results, the teacher can plan future instruction to further enhance the student's critical reading and writing abilities. If the student still struggles with integrating textual evidence, the teacher might schedule additional close reading sessions, focusing on different sections of the text or other literary works. The teacher could also provide more targeted feedback on the use of evidence in writing and offer practice opportunities through short analytical exercises.

To help the student connect prior knowledge and real world experiences to the new content and contexts in the excerpt from pride and prejudice, I would suggest using a strategy that involves watching a contemporary movie adaptation of the novel. By viewing a movie like pride and prejudice and zombies, students can visually see the historical setting and see that even old stories can get a new life with a film adaptation. Adding zombies to the mix will help students get excited about the text, connect with the characters and plot on a deeper level, and relate it to a topic that they already like.

One area of academic need that the student demonstrates is the ability to fully understand the plot. Although the student has made some observations about the characters, they need to grasp the storyline better. Improving this skill will enable the student to produce a more comprehensive literary analysis. One area of academic need that the student demonstrates is the ability to fully understand the plot.

Improving this skill will enable the student to produce a more comprehensive literary analysis.
To address the student's need, I would use an instructional strategy that focuses on summarizing the plot. By having the student write a summary of the excerpt, they can practice identifying the main events and understanding how they are connected. This practice will help the student see the broader picture and improve their ability to analyze the text.

This practice will help the student see the broader picture and improve their ability to analyze the text.
A developmentally appropriate method of assessment to monitor the student's progress toward the identified skill would be to have them participate in a Kahoot activity based on the plot details. This Kahoot would test their recall of the events and ensure that they have a solid understanding of the storyline.

To measure the student's progress and plan for future instruction, I would review the Kahoot results to identify any gaps in their knowledge. If the student answers most of the questions correctly, it indicates that they are developing a better understanding of the plot. Conversely, if the student struggles with answering the Kahoot questions, it may signal the need for additional review and practice with summarizing and recalling plot details. Based on the assessment data, I can adjust future lessons to provide more targeted support, such as additional plot summaries or discussions on the storyline.
