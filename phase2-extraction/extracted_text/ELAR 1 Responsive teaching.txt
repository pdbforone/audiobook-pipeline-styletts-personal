Involving Parents in the School Community
Involving parents in the school community and strengthening the school home relationship are crucial aspects of creating a supportive educational environment. Due to various factors, some parents feel uncomfortable contacting the school, so providing regular opportunities for engagement during school events, such as drop off and pick up times or holding open house events, conveys openness and promotes parent involvement for parents who may otherwise feel alienated from the school community. It also signals that the school is well managed and attentive to both student and parent needs.

Special Programs in Early Childhood
Special programs are individualized classes or interventions that are available to certain young children in Texas. These special programs vary depending on age and ability, and can be provided by public or private entities. For students who have entered public school and are considered advanced according to state and district assessments, school based programs such as Gifted and Talented (G T) can provide additional content to further student growth.

For students who are diagnosed with a disability prior to entering public school, various private therapies may be available depending on diagnosis and severity. These students are also enrolled in Child Find, which allows local education agencies to identify these children and evaluate them for access to Early Childhood Special Education (E C S E). This service provides special education support in public schools for students ages three to five. Following completion of E C S E, students can be further evaluated for special education services in higher grades or dismissed from special education if their disability no longer impacts their educational services.

Representation in Special Programs
Historically, minority students have been overrepresented in special education services in public schools and underrepresented in G T programming. This has been attributed to a variety of factors such as teacher bias, English language learning, and models of school discipline. While this may not be reflected in every special program, teachers and administrators must take actionable steps to address implicit bias within their schools and programs to address disparity in service provision.

Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (I D E A) is a nationwide law that ensures services for students with disabilities. It governs how state and local school districts provide early interventions, special education, and related services for students with disabilities aged three to twenty one. I D E A has six main elements, shown below. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (I D E A) is a nationwide law that ensures services for students with disabilities.

Perhaps the most significant piece of I D E A is the right to a Free Appropriate Public Education (F A P E) in the Least Restrictive Environment (L R E). F A P E is a legal guarantee that children with disabilities will receive individualized and appropriate services to help them reach their highest potential. This guarantee came out of a concern that schools were just "babysitting" students with severe disabilities rather than trying to teach them. The L R E requirement is in place to ensure that students with disabilities are challenged and given the opportunity to be educated alongside non disabled grade level peers. The continuum of support ranges from completely self contained high support environments to low support inclusion in general education classrooms, and programming is developed according to each student's needs.

Identification and Child Find
School districts are responsible for providing free appropriate educational services for students who qualify with a disability. Young children who receive a diagnosis of a disability from a pediatrician or outside entity should be referred and evaluated by the school district to receive appropriate special education services. This includes children who are receiving early intervention from state health services, children with a recent diagnosis from medical professionals, or children with referrals from a health care provider for evaluation by the school district.

The legal right to F A P E includes young children who are not currently receiving services. In Texas, Child Find is a legal requirement that says schools must actively work to identify and provide services to students who may benefit from special education.

Requirement to Provide Services
Under I D E A, it is the district's responsibility to provide the required services based on outside diagnosis or in school evaluation. If the school is not able to provide the appropriate services within the school, the district is legally required under I D E A to refer the parent to a program and incur all financial obligations associated with the placement. The school must provide transportation to and from the program at no cost to the family.

Texas General Process
The general process in Texas includes the phases of identification, assessment, admission, and dismissal. The general process in Texas includes the phases of identification, assessment, admission, and dismissal.
General Process Outline:
A general or special education teacher, caretaker, or parent observes the student's lack of progress in the general education curriculum, or in social or behavioral interactions, based on all assessment data. A general or special education teacher, caretaker, or parent observes the student's lack of progress in the general education curriculum, or in social or behavioral interactions, based on all assessment data.
The general education teacher follows the Response to Intervention (R t I) process. R t I is a scientifically research based instructional intervention system delivered in the general education classroom. It is a process to monitor and measure student progress in the general education curriculum. The general education teacher follows the Response to Intervention (R t I) process. R t I is a scientifically research based instructional intervention system delivered in the general education classroom. It is a process to monitor and measure student progress in the general education curriculum.
If both the instructional and behavioral interventions are not sufficient for the student to progress in the general education curriculum, the R t I team obtains consent from the guardian to conduct a Full and Individual Initial Evaluation (F I I E). The student will then be evaluated by a Licensed Specialist in School Psychology (L S S P) or Diagnostician. The results of the evaluation will determine if the student qualifies for special education services through a variety of disability categories, including autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability, or other health impairment (among others).

The results of the evaluation will determine if the student qualifies for special education services through a variety of disability categories, including autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability, or other health impairment (among others).
The Admission, Review, and Dismissal (A R D) committee reviews the eligibility for specialized services based on the assessment of the data. If a disability and an educational need for specialized services are determined, then with parental consent, the student is eligible to receive specialized services (that is, special education). The Admission, Review, and Dismissal (A R D) committee reviews the eligibility for specialized services based on the assessment of the data. If a disability and an educational need for specialized services are determined, then with parental consent, the student is eligible to receive specialized services (that is, special education).
The A R D committee then designs the Individualized Educational Program (I E P). The purpose of the I E P is to note the student's present level of performance, measurable annual goals, including local education agency (L E A), and the district and state assessments to determine and monitor progress within the general education curriculum as supported by the modifications. The ultimate goal of the I E P is student progress within the general education curriculum as set forth by Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (T E K S). The implementation of the I E P is a collaborative effort between the general and special education teachers. The A R D committee then designs the Individualized Educational Program (I E P).

Every twelve months, there must be an A R D meeting to evaluate the student's progress toward goals. A meeting can be called at any point by any member of the committee, but it must occur at least once per year. Every twelve months, there must be an A R D meeting to evaluate the student's progress toward goals. A meeting can be called at any point by any member of the committee, but it must occur at least once per year.
Every three years, there is a review of existing evaluation data (R E E D), where the A R D committee determines if dismissal from the specialized services is appropriate. A student may meet their goals and continue to need services or new goals for the next school year and would remain in special education. They may also have mastered the skills needed to function independently in a general classroom and can be dismissed. The R E E D is a mandated review of all existing evaluation data, including the initial evaluation, any re evaluations, classroom observations, and standardized testing to determine if dismissal of services is necessary.

I D E A and B I Ps
If problem behaviors are preventing a particular student from learning effectively in the classroom environment, the teacher may initiate the process of creating a Behavioral Intervention Plan (B I P). To start the process, the teacher will seek parental permission for the student to be screened using a Functional Behavior Assessment (F B A). Often completed by a special education teacher with assistance from a behavior specialist or school psychologist, this screening tool will show the frequency of the behavior in question and attempt to determine the root cause of the behavior. From there, a B I P may be created.

A B I P will accomplish the following:
Identify the problem behaviors. Identify the problem behaviors.
Prescribe steps for the teacher to follow when these behaviors are exhibited in the classroom. Prescribe steps for the teacher to follow when these behaviors are exhibited in the classroom.

I D E A ensures that students with certain disabilities who are on a behavior plan receive appropriate services in the Least Restrictive Environment (L R E) possible. If the student has been previously identified to receive special education services, the B I P will become part of the student's I E P. Then, the B I P will be initiated and monitored through the A R D committee meetings.

Other Key Legislation
five oh four plan: Another piece of legislation that plays a role in special education is Section five hundred four of the Rehabilitation Act of nineteen seventy three, and it is often referred to as a "five oh four. " Students who do not have a disability that is severe enough to qualify for an I E P can fall under a five hundred four plan. This law has a broader definition of disability but is limited in what it offers a student. A student, under a five hundred four, must be able to perform on grade level but need assistance to accomplish this. This guarantees a student accommodations, such as extended time on a test, using a spell checker on a writing assignment, or receiving a copy of the teacher's notes for a lecture. It does not change what a student is learning or modify the curriculum. five oh four plan: Another piece of legislation that plays a role in special education is Section five hundred four of the Rehabilitation Act of nineteen seventy three, and it is often referred to as a "five oh four.

N C L B: While No Child Left Behind (N C L B) was focused on education in general, it impacted the reporting on progress of students with disabilities in three ways:
Students with disabilities be held to the same expectations as students without disabilities. Students with disabilities be held to the same expectations as students without disabilities.
Schools publicly report the performance of students with disabilities. Schools publicly report the performance of students with disabilities.
Schools be held accountable for the students' performance, as with any other subgroup of students. Schools be held accountable for the students' performance, as with any other subgroup of students.
E S S A: Every Student Succeeds Act (E S S A) has some ramifications for special education, including the following:
Sets a one percent statewide cap on which students are eligible to participate in alternative assessments (tests with alternate academic achievement standards).

Universal Design for Learning
Universal Design for Learning (U D L) is an educational framework that aims to provide all students, regardless of their learning differences, with equal opportunities to learn by addressing the variability of learners. U D L is based on the principles of universal design, which promotes creating products and environments that are accessible and usable to people with diverse abilities. Some tools and strategies commonly associated with U D L may even be listed as accommodations for some students with I E Ps but are tools from which all students may benefit. For example, many I E Ps for students with executive functioning needs require that classrooms have visual schedules posted on the wall. While this may not be required for all students, it will also help neurotypical or general education students stay organized and feel more confident in their understanding of the daily agenda.

Differentiation in Language Arts Instruction
Differentiation of language arts instruction requires a strong understanding of the students' academic and personal needs. Students of all skill and ability levels require differentiation, not just students who have not mastered a topic. Consider the following populations of students:
students with limited prior experiences with literacy. students with limited prior experiences with literacy.
students with exceptional needs. students with exceptional needs.
English learners. English learners.
students who are experiencing difficulty outside of school. students who are experiencing difficulty outside of school.
students who are performing above grade level. students who are performing above grade level.
students who are gifted and talented. students who are gifted and talented.
While differentiation often focuses on bringing students who are below grade level up to grade level mastery, it is just as important to remember to accommodate students who are struggling for other reasons. A student who doesn't have reliable internet access at home might be allowed to hand write an essay rather than type and submit digitally. A student who recently lost a family member could be given extra time to finish an assignment. Differentiating for more than just academic needs will ensure that students feel valued and are able to participate effectively in learning.

Planning for Differentiation
Individual aspects of student learning will determine the best plan for differentiation. Consider the following components of a lesson:
Topic related background knowledge - Is the student lacking necessary prior knowledge about the subject matter or vocabulary that is limiting comprehension or mastery? Topic related background knowledge - Is the student lacking necessary prior knowledge about the subject matter or vocabulary that is limiting comprehension or mastery?
Pacing - Does the student require additional instructional time to master a skill? Are you spending too much time reviewing when a student is ready to move on?

Complexity - Can the skill or content be broken down into more simple components? Can it be extended into more complex concepts? Complexity - Can the skill or content be broken down into more simple components? Can it be extended into more complex concepts?
Scaffolding - How does this content relate to the skills and content that have come before and will come after? What lower level gaps could be preventing the student from mastering the current skill?

In addition to the components of differentiation, it is also important to remember to include activities that meet students how they learn. Is most of your classroom composed of auditory learners, or are they more visual? Adding multiple modes of learning into your lesson plans is another form of differentiation.

For example, consider this day in a seventh grade language arts class. The class is reading Island of the Blue Dolphins. As students enter the room, the teacher plays a white noise track of the ocean. On the projector is an image of an Aleutian Island landscape. After taking attendance, the teacher asks students to read a short section independently. Then they listen to the teacher reread the same part. Next, they answer a discussion question about the imagery in the text. The teacher projects the question and says it aloud. Students respond in writing, then with a peer, then listen to the whole class discussion. In this activity, students have participated in written and oral responses, have read independently and with the class, and the teacher scaffolds their reading by engaging their senses through the audio and visual prompts at the beginning of the lesson. For example, consider this day in a seventh grade language arts class. The class is reading Island of the Blue Dolphins. As students enter the room, the teacher plays a white noise track of the ocean. On the projector is an image of an Aleutian Island landscape. After taking attendance, the teacher asks students to read a short section independently. Then they listen to the teacher reread the same part.

Types of Differentiation
Specific methods of differentiation will vary depending on the content of the lesson. Some examples of differentiation in a language arts classroom might include:
Different texts depending on skill level and/or student interest. Different texts depending on skill level and/or student interest.
Students who are reading below or above grade level might benefit from easier or more complex texts that cover the same content. Students who are reading below or above grade level might benefit from easier or more complex texts that cover the same content.
Variation in length and difficulty of independent practice. Variation in length and difficulty of independent practice.
For example, students who struggle to form fully organized essays might benefit from focusing on writing a well organized three paragraph essay while students who have mastered this skill complete a five paragraph response. Students who have mastered making inferences practice an additional reading comprehension skill while those who are struggling continue to focus on inferences.

Varied Work Arrangements
If your classroom allows, create space for flexible work arrangements. If your desks are arranged in clusters, but a student prefers to work alone, find an area where the student can sit independently. Pull a small group for focused instruction off to one area while the rest of the class works independently at their desks. If your classroom allows, create space for flexible work arrangements.

Student Choice
The more students have a say in their learning, the more likely they'll be engaged and successful. Allowing students to have a say in their writing prompts, assessment styles, and project formats will tap into their interests and encourage personal success.

Adaptations for Diversity - Students with Disabilities
Students who qualify for special education services will come to your classroom with an Individual Education Program (I E P). The I E P will specify the student's strengths and challenges in each content area and the accommodations and modifications required to be implemented for the student. The first step in adapting the curriculum for a student with a disability is to read through the I E P and identify these requirements. Meeting with the special education teacher can also be beneficial in ensuring that you are meeting your student's needs.

Meeting with the special education teacher can also be beneficial in ensuring that you are meeting your student's needs.
When planning learning experiences and designing assessments for students with disabilities, the teacher should make sure these students are included in content activities and do not feel isolated or overwhelmed. Group projects should be adapted to match their academic ability. Sometimes, accommodations for a student with a disability will benefit the whole class and can be used without drawing attention to or isolating that student.

Sometimes, accommodations for a student with a disability will benefit the whole class and can be used without drawing attention to or isolating that student.
The purpose of the I E P is to note the student's present level of performance, create measurable annual goals to determine and monitor progress within the general education curriculum, create accommodations to assist in the learning process, and determine the district and state assessments the student will participate in.

An I E P may include modifications to the general education curriculum or accommodations or both. Modifications to the curriculum change what the child is being taught, whereas accommodations change how it is taught. For example, a middle school student with an intellectual disability may have modifications to their English curriculum, stating they will write compound sentences (rather than compound complex) or identify three root words and their meanings (rather than five roots). Another student who qualifies for special education services and has reading challenges may not have any modifications. Still, they may need accommodations such as fewer questions on a page and larger diagrams on a test. They will learn the same material as a typical student, but will have help mastering it.
