"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing, " a famous statement attributed to Socrates, is a foundational element of philosophical skepticism. This paradox suggests that human knowledge is inherently limited, and that the wisest individual is the one who recognizes the vast extent of their own ignorance [FOOTNOTE][1]. It is a humble perspective that encourages continuous inquiry and intellectual modesty, arguing that the moment one believes they have grasped ultimate truth, they close themselves off to further learning and growth. Philosophy, in this light, is not about the accumulation of facts, but about a never-ending journey of questioning, challenging assumptions, and seeking a deeper, albeit incomplete, understanding of existence and reality.
A separate, yet equally profound concept explored by philosophers is the ethical dilemma known as the "Trolley Problem, " which highlights the clash between utilitarianism and deontology. This thought experiment asks whether it is morally permissible to pull a lever to divert a runaway trolley from a main track where it would kill five people, onto a side track where it would kill only one [FOOTNOTE][FOOTNOTE]
