About_Systematic Theology
The Christian church has a long tradition of systematic
that is_
studying theology and doctrine organized around fairly standard categories
such as the Word of God, redemption, and Jesus Christ: This introduction t0
systematic theology has several distinctive features:
A strong emphasis on the scriptural
basis for each doctrine and
teaching
Clear writing
with technical terms kepr [0
minimum
contemporary approach;
subjects of special interest t0 the
church today
A friendly tone, appealing to the emotions and the spirit as well as the
intellect
Frequent application to life
Resources for worship with each chapter
Bibliographies with each chapter that CrOsS-reference subjects to
wide
range of other systematic theologies_
theology;
treating
Gnudem s book
stands squarely in the historical Reformed tradition on
the main issues of theology; including the doctrine of Scripture, the doctrine
of God
and the doctrine of salvation.
Perhaps the strongest feature of the
book is its accessibility. Grudem does not water down the meat of
theology
But by minimizing technical terminology and by including hymns_
questions
and indications of application; he makes systematic theology much more
accessible and life-invigorating for
range of Christian readers.
Vern
Poythress_
Westminster Theological Seminary
The whole church is indebted to Wayne Grudem for
fresh presentation of
evangelical Christianity
Even those who d not share his
positions 0n
certain issues will be enriched by Grudem $ clear statement of basic
evangelical theology and his helpful cross-references

Allan Coppedge, Asbury Theological Seminary
Systematic Theology by Wayne Grudem is classic theology for today'$
church:
Beyond most theological works, Grudem addresses doctrine t0
life, in thought; practice, and worship. Although not everyone will agree with
all of Grudem'$ conclusions, he has gifted the church with
wealth of biblical
and
theological teaching in
solid

Theology:
New
Preface
have not written this book for other teachers of
theology (though
many of them will read it)_
have written
students
and not only for
students, but also for every Christian who has
hunger
[0 know the central
doctrines of the Bible in greater depth:
This
why
have called the book
An Introduction
Biblical
Doctrine_
have tried t0 make ir understandable even for Christians who have never
studied theology before.
have avoided
rechnical
terms without first
explaining them:
And most of the chapters can be read on their own_
that
someone can begin at any chapter and grasp
without having read the earlier
material:
Introductory studies do not have t0 be shallow or simplistic.
am convinced
that most Christians are able to understand the doctrinal teachings of the Bible
in considerable depth; provided that
are
presented clearly and without the
use of highly technical
language: Therefore
have nor hesitated
treal
theological disputes in some detail where
seemed necessaly.
Yet this book; despite its size, is still an introduction t0 systematic theology:
Entire books have been written
bout the topics covered in each chapter of
this book, and entire articles have been written about many of the verses
quoted in this book: Therefore each chapter is capable of opening out into
additional study in more breadth or more depth for those who are interested_
The bibliographies at the end of each chapter give some help in that direction.
The following six distinctive features of this book grow out of my convictions
about what systematic
theology is and how
should be taught:
1. A Clear Biblical Basis for Doctrines. Because
believe that theology
should be explicitly based on the teachings of Scripture, in each chapter
have attempted t0 show where the Bible gives support for the doctrines under
consideration: In fact; because
believe that the words of Scripture
themselves have power and authority greater than any human words_
have
not just given Bible references;
have frequently quoted Bible passages at
length so that readers can easily examine for themselves the scriptural
evidence and
that way be like the noble Bereans_
who were
examining the
scriptures daily tO see if these
were S0
(Acts
17:11). This conviction
about the unique nature of the Bible as God' $ words has also led t0 the
inclusion of
Scripture memory passage at the end of each chapter:
hope
or
using
they
things -
2. Clarity in the Explanation of Doctrines
do not believe that God
intended the study of theology to result in confusion and frustration. A student
who comes out of
course in
theology filled only with doctrinal uncertainty
and
thousand unanswered questions is hardly
able t0 give instruction in
sound doctrine and also t0 confute those who contradict it" (Titus 1.9).
Therefore
have tried t0 state the doctrinal
positions of this book clearly and
show where in Scripture
find
convincing evidence for those positions:
do not expect that everyone reading this book will agree with me at every
point of doctrine;
do think that every reader will understand the positions
am arguing for and where Scripture can be found to support those positions.
[think it is only fair tO readers of this book t0 say at the beginning what my
own convictions are regarding certain points that are disputed within
evangelical Christianity
hold to
conservative view of biblical inerrancy;
very much in agreement with the "Chicago Statement" of the International
Council on Biblica
Inerrancy (chapter
and
appendix
and
traditional
Reformed position with regard to questions of God'$ sovereignty and man'$
responsibility (chapter 16), the extent of the atonement (chapter 27), and the
question of predestination (chapter 32). Consistent with the Reformed view;
hold that those who are truly born again will never lose their salvation
(chapter 40)_
with
regard to male-female relationships,
argue for
view that
is neither traditional nor feminist; but "complementarian'
~namely; that God
crealed
Mall
and woman equal in value and personhood, and equal in bearing
his image, but that both creation and redemption indicate some distinct roles
for men and women in
(chapter 22) and in the church (chapter 47).
On church government,
advocate
modified
congregational form of
government, with plural elders in governing positions (chapter 47).
argue for
baptistic view of baptism; namely; that those who give
believable
profession of persona
faith should be baptized (chapter 49).
hold that
"baptism in the Holy Spirit" is
phrase best applied to conversion; and
subsequent experiences are better called "being filled with the Holy Spirit"
(chapter 39); moreover; that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in the
New Testament are still valid for today; but that
apostle" is an office_
noc
gift, and that office does not continue today (chapters 52, 53).
believe that
Christ $ second coming could occur any day; that it will be premillennial
that is_
that it will mark the beginning of his thousand-year reign of perfect
peace on the earth
but thar
will be post-tribulational
that is_
that many
Christians will go through the
tribulation (chapters 54,55).
This does not mean that
ignore other views
Where there are doctrinal
differences within
evangelical Christianity
have tried t0 represent other
positions fairly; to explain why
disagree with them; and t0 give references
marriage
grear
the best available defenses of the opposing positions. In
have made
easy for students
find
conservative
evangelical statement on each topic
from within their own theological traditions
because each chapter contains an
index to treatments of that chapter's subject in
four other
'theology
texts
classified by denominational background. (If
have failed t0 represent an
opposing view accurately
would appreciate
letter from anyone who holds
that view, and
will attempt t0 make corrections if
subsequent edition of
this book is published )
3. Application to Life_
do not believe that God intended the study of
theology
be dry and boring-
is the study of God and all his
works!
is meant [0 be lived and
prayed and sung! All of the great
doctrinal writings of the Bible (such as Paul 's epistle t0 the Romans) are full
of praise to God and personal application t0 life. For this reason
have
incorporated notes on application from time t0 time in the text; and have
added "Questions for Personal
Application'
at the end of each chapter, as
well as
hymn related to the topic of the chapter: True theology
"teaching
which accords with
godliness'
Tim. 6.3), and
when studied
rightly will lead to growth in our Christian lives, and
worship_
Focus On the Evangelical World:
do not think that
[rue
system of
theology
can be constructed from within what we may call the "liberal"
theological
tradition
that is, by people who
the absolute truthfulness of
the Bible_
who do not think the words of the Bible t0 be God' s
words
(see chapter
on the authority of Scripture). For this reason, the other writers
interact with in this book are mostly within what
today called the larger
conservative
evangelical" tradition
from the great Reformers John Calvin
and Martin Luther; down to the writings of evangelical scholars today
write
as an
evangelical and for evangelicals.
This does not mean that those in the
liberal tradition have
valuable t0 say; it simply means that differences
with them almost always boil down t0 differences over the nature of the Bible
and its authority. The amount of doctrinal agreement that can be reached by
people with widely divergent bases of authority is quite limited
am thankful
tor my
evangelical friends who write extensive critiques of liberal theology;
but
do not think that everyone
called t0 do that;
that an extensive
analysis of liberab
views
the most helpful way to build
positive system of
theology based on the total truthfulness of the whole Bible. In
somewhat
like the boy in Hans Christian Andersen'
tale who shouted, " The Emperor
has no clothes!"
think someone needs t0 say that it is doubtful that liberal
theologians have given us any significant insights into the doctrinal teachings
of Scripture that are not already
be found
evangelical writers

Theology
Theology

nothing
facl,
It is not
always appreciated that the world of conservative evangelical
scholarship is s0 rich and diverse that it affords ample opportunity for
exploration of different viewpoints and insights into Scripture
think that
ultimately we will attain much more depth of
understanding of Scripture
when we are able [0 study it in the company of
number of scholars
who all begin with the conviction that the Bible is completely true and
absolutely authoritative.
The cross-references to thirty-four other evangelical
systematic theologies that
have put at the end of each chapter reflect this
conviction: though they are broken down into seven broad
theological

Pentecostal), they all would hold to the inerrancy of the Bible and would

5. Hope for Progress in Doctrinal Unity in the Church:
believe that there
is still much hope for the church to attain deeper and purer doctrinal
understanding; and to overcome old barriers
even those that have persisted
for centuries. Jesus is at work
perfecting his church "that he might present the
church to himself in splendor; without spot or wrinkle Or any such thing-
that
she might be holy and without blemish" (Eph: 5.27), and he has given gifts to
equip the church
until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Son of God" (Eph 413). Though the past history of the
church may discourage US, these Scriptures remain true; and we should not
abandon hope of greater agreement: In fact; in this century we have already
seen much greater
understanding and some greater doctrinal agreement
between Covenant and Dispensational theologians
and berween charismatics
and noncharismatics
moreover;
think the church's understanding of biblicab
inerrancy and of spiritual gifts has also increased significantly in the last few
decades.
believe that the current debate over appropriate roles for men and
women in marriage and the church will eventually result in much greater
understanding of the teaching of Scripture as well, painful though the
controversy may be at the present time_
Therefore, in this book
have nOr
hesitated to raise again some of the old differences (over baptism, the Lord' s
Supper; church government; the millennium and the tribulation; and
predestination, for example)

but even toward greater doctrinal consensus in

the church:
A Sense of the
Urgent Need for Greater Doctrinal Understanding in the
Whole Church_
am convinced that there is an urgent need in the church
today for much greater
understanding of Christian doctrine, Or systematic
theology Not only pastors and teachers need to understand theology in
greater depth
the whole church does as well. One day by God $ grace we
may have churches full of Christians who can discuss, apply; and live the
doctrinal teachings of the Bible as readily as they can discuss the details of
their own jobs or hobbies

doctrine; it is just that
must have access [0 it in an understandable form:

Introduction to Systematic Theology
What is systematic theology?
should Christians study it? How
should we study it?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Definition
Systematic Theology
What is
systematic theology? Many different definitions have been
given;, but for the purposes of this book the following definition will
be used: Systematic theology is any Study that answers tne question,
What does the whole Bible teach us today?
about any given
topic:
This definition indicates that systematic
theology involves
collecting and understanding all the relevant passages in the Bible
various topics and then summarizing their teachings clearly so
that we know what to believe about each topic
Relationship to Other Disciplines
The emphasis of this book will not
therefore be on historical theology (a historical study of how Christians in
different periods have understood various theological topics) or philosophical
theology (studying theological topics largely without use of the Bible
but
using the tools and methods of philosophical reasoning and what can be
known about God from observing the universe
apologetics (providing
defense of the truthfulness of the Christian faith for the purpose of
convincing
unbelievers). These three subjects; which are worthwhile subjects for
Christians
pursue; are sometimes also included in
broader definition of
the term systematic theology: In
some consideration of historical,
philosophical, and apologetic matters will be found at points throughout this
book:
is because historical
study informs uS of the insights gained and
the mistakes made by others previously
understanding Scripture;
philosophical study helps 4s understand right and wrong thought forms
common in our culture and others; and apologetic study helps uS
the
teachings of Scripture
bear on the objections raised by unbelievers
But
Why
fact,
This
bring
these areas of study are not the focus of this volume; which rather interacts
directly with the biblical text in order t0 understand what the Bible itself says
us about various theological subjects
If someone prefers t0 use the term systematic theology in the
broader sense just mentioned instead of the narTow sense which has
been defined above
it will not make much difference
Those who
use the narrower definition will agree that these other areas of study
definitely contribute in
positive way [0
understanding of
systematic
theology; and those who use the broader definition will
certainly agree that historical
theology; philosophical theology, and
apologetics can be distinguished from the process of collecting and
synthesizing all the relevant Scripture passages for various topics_
Moreover; even though historical and philosophical studies do
contribute [0 our
understanding of theological questions, only
Scripture has the final authority t0 define what we are t0 believe_
and it is therefore appropriate t0 spend some time
focusing
on the
process of analyzing the teaching of Scripture itself.
Systematic theology; as we have defined it, also differs from Old
Testament theology; New Testament theology; and biblical theology
These three disciplines organize their topics historically and in the
order the topics are presented in the Bible. Therefore; in Old
Testament
theology;
one might ask; "What does Deuteronomy teach
about
prayer?" or
What do the Psalms teach about prayer?" 0r
"What does Isaiah teach about
0r even,
"What does the
whole Old Testament teach about prayer and how is that
teaching
developed over the history of the Old Testament?" In New
Testament theology one might ask; "What does John'$ gospel teach
about prayer?" or
What does Paul teach about prayer?" or even
"What does the New Testament teach about prayer and what is the
historical development of that teaching as it progresses through the
New
Testament?"
"Biblical
theology"
has
technical meaning in theological studies_
It is the larger category that contains both Old Testament
theology
and New Testament theology as we have defined them above_
Biblical
theology gives special
attention t0 the
individual authors and sections of Scripture; and to the place of
each
teaching in the historical development of Scripture_
So one
might ask; "What is the historical development of the
player?"
teachings
teaching
about prayer as it is seen throughout the history of the Old
Testament and then of the New Testament?" Of course, this
question comes very close to the question; "What does the whole
Bible teach us today about prayer?" (which would be systematic
theology by our definition). It then becomes evident that the
boundary lines berween these various disciplines often overlap at
the edges_
and parts of one study blend into the next:
Yet there is
still
difference_
for biblical
theology
traces the historical
development of
doctrine and the way in which one
place at
SUME
point in that historical development affects one'$
understanding and application of that particular doctrine.
Biblical
theology also focuses on the
understanding of each doctrine that the
biblicab
authors and their original hearers Or readers possessed_
Systematic theology, on the other hand,
makes use of the material
of biblical theology and often builds on the results of biblical
theology:
At some points, especially where great detail and care is
needed in the development of
doctrine, systematic theology will
even use
biblical-theological method,
analyzing the development
of each doctrine through the historical development of Scripture_
But the focus of systematic theology remains different: its focus
on the collection and then the summary of the
teaching of all the
biblical
passages 0n
particular subject Thus systematic theology
asks, for example; "What does the whole Bible teach US today about
prayer?" It attempts tO summarize the
of Scripture in
brief; understandable;
and very carefully formulated statement:
Application to Life: Furthermore, systematic theology focuses on
summarizing each doctrine as it should be understood by present-day
Christians
This will sometimes involve the use of terms and even concepts
that were not themselves used by any individual biblical author; but that are
the proper result of combining the teachings of two Or more biblical authors
particular subject: The terms Trinity; incarnation, and deity of Christ, for
example_
are not found in the Bible, but they usefully summarize biblical
concepts_
Defining systematic theology
include
what the whole Bible
teaches uS today" implies that application to life is
necessary part
of the proper pursuit of systematic theology: Thus
doctrine under
consideration is seen in terms of its practical value for
the
Christian life_
Nowhere in Scripture do we find doctrine studied for
its Own sake 0r in isolation from life. The biblical writers
teaching
Living,
consistently apply their teaching to life: Therefore; any Christian
reading this book should find his or her Christian life enriched and
deepened during this study; indeed, if personal spiritual growth
does not occur; then the book has not been written properly by the
author Or the material has nOt been rightly studied by the reader:
Systematic Theology and Disorganized Theology
If we use this
definition of systematic
theology
will be seen that most Christians actually
do systematic theology (r at least make systematic-theological statements)
many times
week: For example:
Bible says that everyone who believes
in Jesus Christ will be saved:
"The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the only
way to God:
"The Bible says that Jesus
coming
These are all
summaries of what Scripture says and, as such; they are systematic-
theological statements
In fact, every time
Christian says something about
what the whole Bible says; he or she is in
sense
'systematic
theology
according
our definition
by thinking about various topics and
answering the question
"What does the whole Bible teach us
today?"
How then does this book differ from the
systematic
theology" that
MOSL
Christians do? First; it treats biblical topics in_
carefully
organized way to guarantee that all important topics will receive
thorough consideration. This organization also provides one sort of
check against inaccurate analysis of individual topics
for it means
that all other doctrines that are treated can be compared with each
topic for consistency in
methodology and absence of contradictions
in the relationships between the doctrines. This also helps to
ensure
balanced consideration of complementary doctrines: Christ'$ deity
and humanity are studied together; for example_
as are God $
sovereignty and man'
responsibility; so that Wrong conclusions
will not be drawn from an imbalanced emphasis 0n only one aspect
of the full biblical presentation:
the adjective systematic in systematic
should be
understood t0 mean something like
carefully organize=
by topics_
with the understanding that the topics studied
be seen t0 fit
together in
consistent way; and will include all the major doctrinal
topics of the Bible. Thus

opposite of "randomly

second difference between this book and the way most Christians
do systematic theology is that

theology
than most Christians do. For example; an ordinary Christian a5
result of regular reading of the Bible may make the theological
stalement;
The Bible says that everyone who believes in Jesus
Christ will be saved:
That is
perfectly true summary of _
major
biblical teaching_
However; in this book we devote several pages t0
elaborating more precisely what
means to "believe in Jesus
Christ;'
and twelve chapters (chapters 32
43) will be devoted [0
explaining what it means to "be saved" in all of the many
implications of that term:
Third,
formal study of systematic
theology will make
possible
formulate summaries of biblical teachings with much more
accuracy than Christians would nommally arrive at without such
study: In systematic theology; summaries of biblical teachings must
be worded precisely to guard
misunderstandings and tO
exclude false teachings_
Fourth,
good theological analysis must find and treat fairly all the
relevant Bible passages for each particular topic_
nor just some Or
few of the relevant passages. This often means that it must depend
on the results of careful exegesis (or interpretation) of Scripture
generally agreed upon by evangelical interpreters O; where there
are
significant differences of interpretation; systematic theology
will include detailed exegesis at certain points
Because of the large number of topics covered in
study of
systematic theology and because of the great detail with which
these topics are analyzed_
it is inevitable that someone studying
systematic theology text Or taking
course in
systematic theology
for the first time
have many of his or her Own personal beliefs
challenged or modified, refined or enriched. It is of utmost
importance therefore that each person beginning such
course
firmly resolve in his or her Own mind t0 abandon as false any idea
which is found to be clearly contradicted by the teaching of
Scripture.
But it is also very important for each person
resolve
not to believe any individual doctrine simply because this textbook
or some other textbook or teacher says that -
is tnue; unless this
book or the instructor in
course can convince the student from the
text of Scripture itself. It is Scripture alone; not

authority; that must
function as the normative authority for the definition of what

What Are Doctrines? In this book, the word doctrine will be understood
in the following way:_

since

Understood in this way; doctrines can be
broad 0r very
narrow. We can speak of "the doctrine of God" as
major doctrinal category;
including
summary of all that the Bible teaches us today about God. Such
doctrine
be exceptionally large. On the other hand, we may also speak
more narrowly of the doctrine of God'$ eternity; or the doctrine of the Trinity;
or the doctrine of God 's justice:
The book is divided into seven major sections
according
seven
major
doctrines'
or areas of study:
Part 1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
Pairt 2: The Doctrine of God
Part 3: The Doctrine of Man
Pait 4
The Doctrines of Christ and the Holy Spirit
Part 5: The Doctrine of the Application of Redemption
Pait 6: The Doctrine of the Church
Part 7: The Doctrine of the Future
Within each of these major doctrinal categories many more specific
have been selected as
appropriate for inclusion. Generally these meet at least
one of the following three criteria:
they are doctrines that are mOSt
emphasized in Scripture;
they are doctrines that have been most
significant throughout the history of the church and have been important for
all Christians at all times;
are doctrines that have become important
for Christians in the present situation in the history of the church (even though
some of these doctrines may not have been of such great interest earlier in
church history).
Some examples of doctrines in the third category would be
the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture; the doctrine of baptism in the Holy
Spirit; the doctrine of Satan and demons with particular reference t0 spiritual
warfare, the doctrine of spiritual gifts in the New Testament age, and the
doctrine of the creation of man as male and female in relation t0 the

relevance to the contemporary situation; doctrines such as these have received
more emphasis in the present volume than in most traditional textbooks of
systematic theology:
Finally; what is the difference berween systematic
theology and
Christian ethics? Although there is inevitably some overlap
between the study of theology and the study of ethics,
have tried
[O maintain
distinction in emphasis_
The emphasis of systematic
theology is on what God wants uS to believe and to know; while the
emphasis in Christian ethics is 0n what God wants US [0 d0 and
what attitudes he wants US t0 have_
Such
distinction is reflected in
the
following definition: Christian ethics is any Study that answers
the question;
What does God require US t0 do and what attitudes
does he require uS
have today?
with regard to any given
situation Thus theology focuses on ideas while ethics focuses on
situations in life.
Theology tells us how we should think while
ethics tells us how we should live_

would discuss topics such as marriage and divorce, lying
and
the truth, stealing and ownership of property; abortion,
birth control, homosexuality; the role of civil government;
discipline of children, capital punishment, war; care for the pOOI;
racial discrimination, and s0 forth:
Of course there is some overlap:
theology must be applied to life (therefore
is often ethical t0 some
degree)
And ethics must be based on proper ideas of God and his
world (therefore it is theological to some degree):
This book will emphasize systematic theology; though

readily. Still, for
thorough treatment of Christian ethics, another
textbook similar to this in scope would be necessary:

things
Why should Christians study systematic theology? That is, why
should we engage in the process of collecting and summarizing the
teachings of many individual Bible passages 0n particular topics?
Why is it not sufficient simply to continue
the Bible
regularly every day
our lives?
The Basic Reason: Many answers have been given to this question, but tOo
often they leave the impression that systematic
somehow can
"improve-
on the Bible by doing
better job of organizing its teachings 01
explaining them more clearly than the Bible itself has done
Thus we may
begin implicitly to
the clarity of Scripture (seechapter 6) or the
sufficiency of Scripture (see chapter 8).
However; Jesus commanded his disciples and nOw commands uS
also t0 teach believers t0 observe all that he commanded:
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching
them [0 observe all that
have commanded you; and lo,
am with you
always, to the close of the age
(Matt. 28.19-20)
Now
teach all that Jesus commanded, in
narrow sense, is simply tO teach
the content of the oral teaching of Jesus as it is recorded in the gospel
narratives_
However; in a broader sense; "all that Jesus commanded" includes
the interpretation and application of his life and teachings, because in the
book of Acts it is implied that
contains
narrative of what Jesus continued
do and teach through the apostles after his resurrection (note that 1:1
speaks of=
all that Jesus began to do and teach") "All that Jesus commanded"
can also include the Epistles_
since they were written under the supervision of
the Holy Spirit and were also considered to be
command of the Lord"
Cor: 14.37; see also John 14.26; 16.13;
Thess. 4.15;
Peter 3.2; and Rev:
1.1-3). Thus in
larger sense_
all that Jesus commanded" includes all of the
New Testament.
Furthermore, when we consider that the New Testament writings
endorse the absolute confidence Jesus had in the authority and
reliability of the Old Testament Scriptures as God $ words (see
chaprer
and when we realize that the New Testament epistles
also endorse this view of the Old Testament as absolutely
authoritative words of God_
then it becomes evident that

including all of the Old
Testament (rightly understood in the various ways
which it

theology

applies t0 the new
Covenant
age in the history of redemption) as
well:
The task of
fulfilling the Great Commission includes therefore not
only evangelism but also teaching: And the task of
teaching all that
Jesus commanded uS is, in
broad sense_
the task of teaching what
the whole Bible says tO US today To effectively teach ourselves and
to teach others what the whole Bible says, it is necessary t0 collect
and summarize all the Scripture passages on
particular subject
For example, if someone asks me,
What does the Bible teach
about Christ'$ return?"
could say; "Just keep
your Bible
and you
find out.
But if the questioner begins reading at Genesis
1:l it will be
time before he 0r she finds the answer t0 his
question: By that time many other questions will have needed
answers, and his list of unanswered questions will
begin tO grow
very long indeed.
What does the Bible teach about the work of the
Holy Spirit? What does the Bible teach about prayer? What does
the Bible teach about sin? There simply
not time in our lifetimes
read through the entire Bible looking for an answer for ourselves
every time
doctrinal question arises:
Therefore, tOr US t0 learn
what the Bible says, it is very helpful to have the benefit of the
work of others who have searched through Scripture and found
answers t0 these various topics:
We can teach others most effectively if we can direct them t0 the
most relevant passages and suggest an appropriate summary of the
teachings of those passages_
Then the person who questions 4s can
inspect those passages quickly for himself or herself and leam
much more rapidly what the teaching of the Bible is on
particular
subject Thus the necessity of systematic theology for teaching what
the Bible says comes about primarily because
are finite in
memory and in the amount of time at our disposal.
The basic reason for studying systematic theology; then; is that it
enables uS t0 teach ourselves and others what the whole Bible says;
thus fulfilling the second part of the Great Commission.
2. The Benefits to Our Lives. Although the basic reason for studying
systematic theology is that it is
means of obedience
Lord's command
there are some additional specific benefits that come from such study.
First, studying theology helps US overcome our wrong ideas_
reading

our

could read the Bible from cover

and, although we would not immediately learn everything
in the Bible_
most likely learn only true things about God
and his creation. Every time we read it we would learn more true
things and we
would not rebel 0r refuse to accept anything we
found written there:
But with sin in Our hearts we retain some
rebelliousness against God.
At various points there are
for all of
biblical
which for one reason 0r another we do not
want t0 accept The study of systematic
theology is of help in
overcoming those rebellious ideas
For example, suppose there is someone who does not want to
believe that Jesus
personally coming back to earth again. We
could show this person one verse Or perhaps tWo that speak of
Jesus' return to earth, but the person might still find
way [0 evade
the force of those verses 0r read
different meaning into them. But
if we collect twenty-five O1 thirty verses that say that Jesus is
coming back to earth personally and write them all out on paper;
our' friend who hesitated t0 believe in Christ'$ return is much more
likely to be persuaded by the breadth and diversity of biblical
evidence for this doctrine. Of course, we all have areas
that;
areas where 0ur
understanding -
of the Bible'
is inadequate.
these areas;
is helpful fOr US t0 be confronted with the total
weight of the teaching of Scripture on that subject; SO that we Will
more readily be persuaded even against our initial wrongful
inclinations
Second, studying systematic theology helps us to be able to make
better decisions later on new questions of doctrine that may arise
We cannot know what new doctrinal controversies will arise in the
churches in which we will live and minister ten, twenty; or thirty
years from nOw, if the Lord does nOt return before then. These new
doctrinal controversies will sometimes include questions that no
one has faced very carefully before
Christians
be asking;
"What does the whole Bible say about this subject?" (The precise
nature of biblical inerrancy and the appropriate
understanding of
biblicaB
gifts of the Holy Spirit are Lwo examples of
questions that have arisen in our century with much more
forcefulness than ever before in the history of the church:)
Whatever the new doctrinab
controversies are in future years_
those
who have learned systematic theology well
be much better able
would

Will
to answer the new questions that arise. The reason for this is that
everything that the Bible says is somehow related t0 everything else
the Bible says (for it all fits together in
consistent way; at least
within God:
own
understanding of reality; and in the nature of God
and creation as they really are). Thus the new question will be
related to much that has already been learned from Scripture. The
more thoroughly that earlier material has been learned, the better
able
will be tO deal with those new questions
This benefit extends even more broadly: We face problems of
applying Scripture t0 life in many more contexts than formal
doctrinal
discussions. What does the Bible teach about husband-
wife relationships? About raising children? About witnessing to

more mature Christians. If it does not do this
we are not
studying it
in the way God intends_
the Bible often connects sound doctrine with maturity in
Christian living: Paul speaks of "the teaching which accords with
godliness"
6.3) and says that his work as an apostle is "to
further the faith of God*$ elect and their knowledge of the truth
which accords with
godliness" ( Titus 1:1) By contrast; he indicates
that all kinds of disobedience and immorality are
contraly [0 sound

(1 Tim: 1:10).
In connection with this idea it is appropriate t0 ask what the
difference is between
major doctrine
and
minor doctrine
Christians often say
want t0 seek agreement in the church on
major doctrines but also t0 allow for differences on minor doctrines_
have found the following guideline useful:
A major doctrine is one that has
significant impact on our
thinking
abour other doctrines
or that has
significant impact on how we live
the Christian life
A minor doctrine
one that has
little impact
on how
think about other doctrines
and very little impact on how
we live the Christian life:
By this standard doctrines such as the authority of the Bible
(chapter 4) , the Trinity (chapter 14), the deity of Christ (chapter
26) , justification by faith (chapter 36), and many others would
rightly be considered major doctrines. People who disagree with the
historic evangelical understanding of any of these doctrines will
have wide areas of difference with evangelical Christians who
affirm these doctrines_
By contrast;
seems t0 me that differences
over forms of church government (chapter 47) 0r some details
about the Lord's Supper (chapter 50) or the
of the great
tribulation (chapter 55) concern minor doctrines_
Christians who
differ over these
can agree on perhaps every other area of
doctrine_
live Christian lives that differ
important way;
and can have genuine fellowship with one another:
Of course; We may find doctrines that fall somewhere between
"major" and "minor" according t0 this standard For example;
Christians may differ over the degree of significance that should

A Note on Two Objections to the Study of Systematic Theology
#The Conclusions Are
Too Neat' to be True.
Some scholars look with
suspicion at systematic theology when
or even because
teachings fit
rogether in
noncontradictory way: They object that the results are
too neat"
and that systematic theologians must therefore be squeezing the Bible $
teachings into an artificial mold, distorting the true meaning of Scripture
get an orderly set of beliefs
To this objection LWo responses can be made: (1) We must first ask
the people making the objection
tell us at what specific points
Scripture has been misinterpreted
and then we muSt deal with the
understanding of those passages. Perhaps mistakes have been made;
and in that case there should be corrections
Yet it is also possible that the objector will have no specific
passages in mind, O no clearly erroneous interpretations tO point tO
in the works of the most responsible
evangelical theologians. Of
couise _
incompetent exegesis can be found in the writings of the
less competent scholars in any field of biblical studies, not just in
systematic
theology; but those "bad examples"
constitute an
objection not against the scholar's field but against the incompetent
scholar himself:
It is very important that the objector be specific at this point
because this objection is sometimes made by those who
perhaps
unconsciously
have adopted from Our culture
skeptical view of
the possibility of finding universally true conclusions about
anything, even about God from his Word. This kind of skepticism
regarding theological truth
especially common in the modern
university world where "systematic theology'
-if it is studied at all
is studied only from the perspectives of philosophical theology
and historical
theology (including perhaps
historical study of the
various ideas that were believed by the early Christians who wrote
the New 'Testament; and by other Christians at that time and
throughout church history) In this kind of intellectual climate the
study of "systematic theol
as defined in this chapter would be
considered impossible; because the Bible would be assumed to be
merely the work of many human authors who wrote out of diverse
cultures and experiences over the course of more than one thousand
years: trying
find
what the whole Bible teaches'
about any
subject would be thought nearly as hopeless as trying to find "what
all philosophers teach" about some question; for the answer in both
cases would be thought to be not one view but many diverse and
often
conflicting views. This skeptical viewpoint must be rejected
evangelicals who see Scripture as the product of human and
divine authorship, and therefore as
collection of
that
teach noncontradictory truths about God and about the universe he
created_
(2) Second,
must be answered that in God'$ own mind, and in the
nature of reality itself; true facts and ideas are all consistent with
one another: Therefore if we have accurately understood the
of God in Scripture we should expect our conclusions tO
"fit together" and be mutually consistent: Internal consistency;
is an argument for; not against; any individual results of systematic
theology:
#The Choice of Topics Dictates the Conclusions_
Another general
objection t0 systematic theology concerns the choice and arrangement of
topics, and even the fact that such topically arranged study of Scripture, using
categories sometimes different from those found in Scripture itself, is done at
all Why are these theological topics treated rather than just the topics
emphasized by the biblical authors, and why are the topics arranged in this
way rather than in some Other way? Perhaps
this objection would say
our
traditions and our cultures have determined the topics we treat and the
arrangement of topics,
that the results of this systematic-theological study
of Scripture; though acceptable in our own theological tradition; will in fact
be untrue to Scripture itself:
A variant of this objection is the statement that our starting point
logy"
wrilings
teachings =
then,
often determines our conclusions on controversial topics: if we
decide t0 start with an emphasis on the divine authorship of
Scripture, for example
we will end up believing in biblical
inerrancy; but if we start with an emphasis on the human authorship
of Scripture, we will end up believing there are some errors in the
Bible: Similarly; if we start with an emphasis on God $ sovereignty;
we will end up as Calvinists
but if we start with an emphasis on
man '$ ability
make free choices_
we will end up as Arminians_
and so forth This objection makes it sound as if the most important
theological questions could probably be decided by flipping
coin
to decide where to start; since different and equally valid
conclusions will inevitably be reached from the different starting
points_
Those who make such an objection often suggest that the best way
avoid this problem is not to study or teach systematic theology at
all, but to limit our topical studies t0 the field of biblical
theology;
treating only the topics and themes the biblical authors themselves
emphasize and describing the historicab_
development of these
biblical
themes through the Bible_
In response t0 this objection, much of the discussion in this chapter
about the necessity [0 teach Scripture
be relevant. Our choice
of topics need not be restricted t0 the main concerns of the biblical
authors, for our
is t0 find out what God requires of us in all
areas of concern t0 US today:
For example; it was not the main concern of any
Testament
author to explain such topics as "baptism in the Holy Spirit;
women $ roles in the church;
the doctrine of the Trinity; but these
valid areas of concern for uS
and we must look at all the
places in Scripture that have relevance for those topics (whether
those specific terms are mentioned 0r nOt; and whether those
themes are of primary concemn t0 each passage we examine Or nOt)
if we are going t0 be able to understand and explain to others
what
the whole Bible teaches
about them:
The only alternative
for we will think something about those
subjects
to form our opinions haphazardly from
general
impression of what we feel to be
~biblical" position 0n each
subject, or
perhaps
buttress our positions with careful analysis of
one Or LWO relevant texts, yet with no guarantee that those texts

Such an alternative is t00 subjective and too subject to
cultura
pressures_
It tends toward doctrinal fragmentation and
widespread doctrinal uncertainty; leaving the church theologically
immature, like
children; tossed t0 and fro and carried about with
every wind of doctrine'
(Eph: 414).
Concerning the objection about the choice and sequence of topics_
there
prevent us from
going
Scripture t0 look for
answers t0 any doctrinal questions, considered in any sequence:
The sequence of topics in this book is
common one and has
been adopted because
is orderly and lends itself well to
and teaching_
But the chapters could be read
any sequence one
wanted and the conclusions should not be different; nor should the
persuasiveness of the arguments
are rightly derived from
Scripture
be significantly diminished
In fact;
suspect that most
readers of this book will not read it through from chapter
chapter 57
but will begin with the chapters of most interest [0
them; and read others later: That does not really matter; because
have tried
write the chapters SO that they can be read as
independent units_
and
have added cross-references t0 sections in
other chapters where relevant: Whether one reads the chapter on the
new heavens and new earth (chapter 57) first or last or somewhere
in between, the arguments will be the same, the Scripture passages
quoted for support will be the same, and the conclusions should be
the same.

How then should we study systematic theology? The Bible provides
some
guidelines for answering this question.
1. We Should Study Systematic
With Prayer: If studying
systematic
theology is simply
certain way of studying the Bible, then the
passages in Scripture that talk about the way in which we should study God $
Word give
guidance
uS in this task. Just as the
psalmist prays in Psalm
119.18,
Open my eyes, that
may behold wondrous
out of your Iaw;
S0 we should pray and seek God s help
understanding his Word:
Paul tells
uS in
Corinthians 2.14 that "the unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of
nothing

thinps
the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he
not able t0 understand
them because they are spiritually discerned
Studying theology is therefore
spiritual activity in which we need the help of the Holy Spirit.
No matter how intelligent; if the student does not continue t0 pray
for God to give him or her an understanding mind and
believing
and humble heart; and the student does not maintain
personal
walk with the Lord, then the teachings of Scripture will be
misunderstood and disbelieved
doctrinal error will result; and the
mind and heart of the student will not be changed for the better but
for the worse_
Students of systematic theology should resolve at the
beginning
their lives free from any disobedience to God or
any known sin that would disrupt their relationship with him. They
should resolve t0 maintain with great regularity their own personal
devotional lives. They should continually pray for wisdom and
understanding
Scripture_
Since it is the Holy Spirit who gives uS the ability rightly to
understand Scripture_
we need t0 realize that the proper

particularly when we are unable

is to pray for God's help. Often what
need is not more data but more insight into the data we already
have available.
This insight is given only by the Holy Spirit (cf:
Cor: 2.14; Eph 1.17-19).
We Should Study Systematic
With Humility: Peter tells uS_
"Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another; for
God
opposes the proud_
but gives grace t0 the humble
(1 Peter 5.5). Those who
study systematic
will leam many

their churches 0r by relatives who are older in the Lord than
are. They
may also find that they understand things about Scripture that some of their
church officers do not understand, and that even their pastor has perhaps
forgotten or never learned well:
In all of these situations it would be very easy to adopt an attitude
of pride or superiority tOward others who have nOt made such
study: But how ugly it would be

deductions we draw from the statements of Scripture are nOt equal to the
statements of Scripture themselves in certainty Or authority; for our ability t0

What then are the limits 0n our use of our reasoning abilities to
draw deductions from the statements of Scripture? The fact that
reasoning t0 conclusions that g0 beyond the mere statements of

studying Scripture;
and the fact that Scripture itself is the ultimate standard of truth,
combine t0 indicate [0 US that we are free t0 use our reasoning
abilities to draw deductions from any passage of Scripture SO
as these deductions do not contradict the clear teaching of some
other passage of Scripture:
This principle puts

Our supposedly logical
deductions may be erroneous, but Scripture itself cannot be
erroneous.
Thus, for example
we may read Scripture and find that

God (John 20.28; Titus 2.13), and that God the Holy Spirit is called

God (Acts 5.3-4).
We might deduce from this that there are three
Gods. But then we find the Bible explicitly teaching US that God is
one (Deut: 6.4; James 2.19). Thus we conclude that what
thought to be
valid logical deduction about three Gods was wrong
and that Scripture teaches both (a) that there are three separate
persons (the Father; the Son, and the Holy Spirit), each of whom is
fully God_
and (b) that there is one God.

We can

reconciled, even though at this point God's thoughts are higher than
our thoughts (Isa_

Ultimately, there is no internal contradiction either in
Scripture 0r in God
own thoughts.
We Should Study Systematic

We
need to be thankful that God has put teachers in the church
And God has

We Should Study Systematic
by Collecting and
Understanding All the Relevant Passages of Scripture on Any Topic: This
point was mentioned in OU1 definition of systematic theology at the beginning
of the chapter; but the actual process needs to be described here: How does
one g0 about making
doctrinal summary of what all the passages of
Scripture teach on
certain topic? For topics covered in this book, many
people will think that studying the chapters in this book and
the Bible
verses noted in the chapters is enough But some people will want t0 do
further study of Scripture on
particular topic 0r study some new topic not
covered here. How could
student go about using the Bible to research its
on some new subject; perhaps one not discussed explicitly in any of
his or her systematic
theology textbooks?
The process would look like this: ( 1) Find all the relevant verses.
The best help in this step is
good concordance_
which enables one
look up key words and find the verses
which the subject is
treated
For example,
studying what
means that man is created
in the image and likeness of God_
one needs t0 find all the verses in
which "image'
and "likeness"
and
creale'
occur: (The words
"man" and
God" occur t00 often to be useful for
concordance
search:
studying the doctrine of prayer; many words could be
looked up (pray, prayer; intercede, petition, supplication, confess,
confession, praise , thanks, thanksgiving _
et al:)
and perhaps the
list of verses would grow too long to be manageable, so that the
student would have t0 skim the concordance entries without
up the verses,
the search would probably have t0 be
divided into sections or limited in some other way: Verses can also
be found by thinking through the overall history of the Bible and
then
to sections where there would be information on the
topic at hand
for example;
student studying prayer would want
read passages like the one about Hannah'$ prayer for
son (in
Sam: 1)
Solomon'
prayer at the dedication of the temple (in
8) , Jesus
prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (in Matt: 26
and parallels), and so forth Then in addition t0 concordance work
and reading other passages that one can find on the subject;
checking the relevant sections in some systematic
theology books
will often bring to light other verses that had been missed,
sometimes because none of the key words used for the concordance
were in those verses
The second step is t0 read_
make notes On, and try [0 summarize
the
points made in the relevant verses
Sometimes
theme will be

repeated often and the summary of the various verses will be
relatively easy: At other
times
there will be verses difficult tO
understand, and the student will need to take some time t0 study
verse in depth (just by
the verse in context over and over; or
by using specialized tools such as commentaries and dictionaries)
until
satisfactory understanding is reached_
(3) Finally; the teachings of the various verses should be
summarized into one Or more points that the Bible affirms about
that subject: The summary does not have t0 take the exact form of
anyone else $ conclusions on the subject; because we each may see
in Scripture that others have missed, or we may organize the
subject differently 0r emphasize different things.
On the other hand, at this point it is also helpful
read related
sections, if any can be found, in several systematic
theology books
This provides
useful check against error and oversight; and often
makes one aware of alternative
perspectives and arguments that
may cause 4S
modify or strengthen Our position If
student
finds that others have argued for strongly differing conclusions,
then these other views need t0 be stated tairly and then answered
Sometimes other
theology books will alert US
historical or
philosophical considerations that have been raised before in the
history of the church, and these will provide additional insight
wamings against error:
The process outlined above is possible for any Christian who can
read his or her Bible and can look up words in
concordance. Of
course people will become faster and more accurate in this process
with time and experience and Christian maturity, but
would be
tremendous help t0 the church
Christians generally would give
much more time [0 searching out topics in Scripture for themselves
and drawing conclusions in the way outlined above_
The joy of
discovery of biblical themes would be richly rewarding: Especially
pastors and those who lead Bible studies would find added
freshness in their understanding of Scripture and in their
teaching:
6. We Should Study Systematic
With
Rejoicing and Praise
The
study of theology is not merely
theoretical exercise of the intellect_ It is _
study of the living God
and of the wonders of all his works in creation and
redemption. We cannot study this subject dispassionately! We must love all
that God is, all that he says and all that he does_

Our response t0 the study of the
theology of Scripture should be that of the psalmist who said, "How precious
[O me are YOUI thoughts_
0 Godl" (Ps. 139.17). In the study of the teachings
of God s Word, it should not surprise US if we often find our hearts
spontaneously breaking forth in expressions of praise and
delight like those of
the psalmist:
The precepts of the LORD are right;
rejoicing the heart: (Ps. 19.8)
In the way of your testimonies
delight
as much as in all riches. (Ps. 119.14)
How sweet are your words t0 my taste,
sweeter than honey to my mouth! (Ps. 119:103)
Your testimonies are my heritage for ever;
yea, they are the joy of my heart: (Ps. 119.111)
[rejoice at your word
like one who finds great
(Ps. 119.162)
Often in the study of theology the response of the Christian should be similar
[0 that of Paul in
reflecting
on the
theological argument that he has just
completed at the end of Romans 11:32. He breaks forth into joyful praise at
the richness of the doctrine which God has enabled him t0 express:
0 the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
Students have repeatedly mentioned that one of the most valuable
parts of any of their courses in college Or seminary has been the
Scripture passages
were required to memorize:
have hidden
your word in my heart thal
might not sin against you" (Ps. 119:11
NIV): In each chapter; therefore;
have included an appropriate
memory passage S0 that instructors may incorporate Scripture
memory into the course
requirements wherever possible. (Scripture

passages at the end of each chapter are taken from the
RSV These same passages in the NIV and NASB may be found in

Matthew 28.18-20: And Jesus came and said t0 them; "All authority in

all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit; teaching them t0 observe all that

the close of the age:
HYMN
Systematic theology at its best will result in praise:
It is appropriate
therefore at the end of each chapter t0 include
hymn related t0 the
subject of that chapter: In a classroom setting_
the hymn can be sung
together
the beginning or end of class. Alternatively, an
individual reader can sing
privately or simply meditate quietly on
the words:
For almost every chapter the words of the hymns were found in
Trinity Hymnal (Philadelphia: Great Commission Publications,
1990),
the hymnal of the Presbyterian Church in America and the
Orthodox Presbyterian Church; but most of them are found in many
other common hymnals. Unless otherwise noted_
the words of
these hymns are nOw in public domain and no longer subject t0
copyright restrictions: therefore they may be freely copied for
overhead projector use

Why have
used s0 many old hymns? Although
personally like
many of the more recent worship songs that have come into wide
use
when
select hymns that would correspond
the
doctrines of the Christian faith;
realized that the great hymns
of the church
throughout history have
doctrinal richness and
breadth that is still unequaled: For several of the chapters in this
book;
know of no modern worship song that covers the same
subject in an extended way
perhaps this can be
challenge
modern songwriters t0 study these chapters and then write songs
reflecting the teaching of Scripture on the respective subjects_
For this chapter; however;
found no hymn ancient Or modem that
thanked God for the privilege of studying systematic theology from
the pages of Scripture: Therefore
have selected
hymn of general
praise, which is always appropriate:
"0 for

This hymn by Charles Wesley (1707-

Chapter 2
The Word 3of God
What are the different forms of the Word of God?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
What is meant by the phrase "the Word of God"? Actually; there are
several different meanings taken by this phrase in the Bible. It is
helpful
distinguish these different senses clearly at the beginning
of this study:
"The Word
Jesus Chnc
Sometimes the Bible refers t0 the Son of God as "the Word of
God.
In Revelation 19.13, John sees the risen Lord Jesus in heaven
and says _
"The name by which he is called is The Word of God:
Similarly; in the beginning of John's gospel we read, "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God" (John 1:1). It is clear that John is speaking of the Son of
God here
because in verse 14 he says
"And the Word became flesh
and dwelt among 4s, full of grace and truth;
have beheld his
glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father:
These verses (and
perhaps
John 1.1) are the only instances where the Bible refers to
God the Son as "the Word" or "the Word of God
sO this usage
not common But it does indicate that among the members of the
Trinity it is especially God the Son who in his person as well as in
his words has the role of
communicating the character of God t0 US
and of expressing the will of God for 4S_
The Word
SpEch
God's Decrees. Sometimes God $ words take the form of powerful decrees
that cause events [0
happen or even cause things tO come into being:
And
God said,
'Let there be light'
and there was light" (Gen: 1.3). God even
created the animal world by speaking his powerful word:
And God said,
Let
the earth bring forth living creatures according
their kinds: cattle and
F"ze4:
creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds_
And
was
(Gen: 1.24). Thus_
the psalmist can say; "By the word of the Lord the
heavens were made
and all their host by the breath of his mouth'
(Ps. 33.6).
These powerful, creative words from God are often called God'$
decrees_
decree of God is
word of God that causes something
happen: These decrees of God include not only the events of the
original creation but also the
continuing
existence of all
Hebrews 1:3 tells us that Christ is continually "upholding the
universe by his word of power:
God's Words of Personal Address:
God sometimes communicates with
people on earth by speaking directly t0 them
These can be called instances of
God'$ Word of personal address: Examples are found throughout Scripture
At the very beginning of creation God
Adam:
And the LORD God
commanded the man, saying_
You may freely eat of every tree of the
garden;
but of the tree of the knowledge of
and evil you shall not eat; for in the
that you eat of it YOu shall die'
(Gen_
2.16-17)
After the sin of Adam
and Eve_
God still comes and speaks directly and personally to them in the
words of the curse (Gen. 3.16-19).
Another prominent example of God's
direct persona
address
people on earth is found
the giving of the 'Ten
Commandments:
And God
all these words
saying; `T am the LORD
your God, who brought YOu out of the land of Egypt; out of the house of
bondage_
You shall have no other
before me
(Ex. 20.1-3). In the
Vew Testament; at Jesus' baptism, God the Father spoke with
voice
heaven, saying; "This is my beloved Son, with whom
am well pleased"
(Matt: 317).
In these and several other instances where God spoke words of
personal address t0 individual people it was clear to the hearers that
these were the actual words of God: they were hearing God $
voice_
and they were therefore hearing words that had absolute
divine authority and that were absolutely trustworthy: To disbelieve
disobey any of these words would have been t0 disbelieve or
disobey God and therefore would have been sin:
Though the words of God'$ personal address are always seen in
Scripture
be the actual words of God,
are also "human
words in that they are spoken in ordinary human language that is
immediately understandable.
The fact that these words are spoken
in human
language does not limit their divine character Or authority
in any way: they are
entirely the words of God, spoken by the
things;
speaks
Bood
day
spoke
gods
from
vely
they
still
voice of God himself:
Some theologians have
that since human language is always
some sense "imperfect;
any message that God addresses tO uS in
human language muSt also be limited in its authority Or
truthfulness _
But these passages and many others that record
instances ot God'
words of personal address t0 individuals give no
indication of any limitation of the authority or truthfulness of God $
words when they are spoken in human language_
Quite the contrary
true_
fOr the words always place an absolute
obligation
upon the
hearers [0 believe them and t0
them fully. To disbelieve 0r
disobey any part of them is t0 disbelieve Or disobey God himself.
3. God's Words as Speech Through Human Lips. Frequently in Scripture
God raises up prophets through whom he speaks. Once
it is evident thar
although these are human words, spoken in ordinary human language by
ordinary human beings_
the authority and truthfulness of these words is in no
way diminished:
still completely God's words as well.
In Deuteronomy 18,
God says to Moses:
[will raise up for them
prophet like you from among their brethren;
and
will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak t0 them all
that
command him: And whoevel
not give heed to my words
which he shall speak in my name
myself will require it of him. But
the prophet who presumes t0
speak
word in my name which
have
not commanded him t0 speak; or who speaks in the name of other
that same prophet shall die_
(Deut. 18.18-20)
God made
similar statement t0 Jeremiah:
Then the LORD puL
forth his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said tO me
Behold,
have put my words in your mouth
(Jer: 1.9). God tells
Jeremiah; "Whatever
command you YOu shall speak" (Jer: 1:7; see
also Ex. 4.12; Num_
22.38;
Sam
15.3,18, 23;
20.36;
Chron. 20.20; 25.15-16; Isa. 30.12-14; Jer: 6.10-12; 36.29-31; et
al.). Anyone who claimed to be speaking for the Lord but who had
not received
message from him was severely punished (Ezek:
13.1-7; Deut: 18.20-22).
Thus God*$ words spoken through human lips were considered to
be just as authoritative and just as true as God $ words of personal
address_
There was no
diminishing of the authority of these words
when they were spoken through human lips. To disbelieve Or"
argued
obey
again,
they
will
gods,
Kings
disobey any of them was t0 disbelieve or disobey God himself:
God's Words in Written Form (the Bible): In addition
God'$ words of
decree;
God $ words of personal address _
and God's words spoken through the
lips of human
we also find in Scripture several instances where God'$
words were put in written form The first of these is found in the narrative of
the giving of the two tablets of stone on which were written the Ten
Commandments:
And he gave to Moses_
when he had made an end of
speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables
of stone
written with the finger of God" (Ex. 31:18)
And the tables were the
work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables
(Ex: 32.16; 34.1, 28).
Further writing was done by Moses:
And Moses wrote this law, and gave it tO the priests the sons of Levi,
who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD; and t0 all the elders
ot Israel. And Moses commanded them;
At the end of every seven
years
you shall read this law before all Israel in their
that
may hear and leam t0 fear the LORD your God;
and be
careful t0 do all the words of this law, and that their children, who
have not known it; may hear and learn
fear the LORD your
God
(Deut: 31.9-13)
This book which Moses wrote was then deposited by the side of the ark of the
covenant:
When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in
book;
to the very end, Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the
covenant of the LORD,
Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the
ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, thar
may be there for
witness
you
(Deu 31.24-26).
Further additions were made
this book of God $ words_
And
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God" (Josh:
24.26). God commanded Isaiah,
And now; g0, write it before them
tablet;, and inscribe it in a book; that
may be fOr the time [0
come as
witness for ever" (Isa. 30.8). Once again; God said to
Jeremiah; "Write in

Several benefits come from the writing down of God's words. First,
there
much more accurate preservation of God's words for
subsequent generations_
To depend on memory and the repeating of
oral tradition is
less reliable method of preserving these words
throughout history than is their recording
writing (cf:
Deut:
31:12-13). Second, the opportunity for repeated inspection of
words that are written down permits careful study and discussion,
which leads to better understanding and more complete obedience:
Third, God's words in
are accessible t0 many more people
than they are when preserved merely through memory and oral
repetition. They can be inspected at any time by any person and are
limited in accessibility t0 those who have memorized them 0r
those who are able to be present when they are recited orally Thus
the reliability; permanence; and accessibility of the form in which
God's words are preserved are all greatly enhanced when they are
written down Yet there is no indication that their authority or
truthfulness is diminished:

Chapter ?
The Canon of Scripture
What belongs in the Bible and what does not belong?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The previous chapter concluded that it is especially the written
words of God in the Bible to which we are to give ur attention.
Before
can do this_
however;
must know which writings
belong in the Bible and which do not This is the question of the
canon of Scripture, which may be defined as follows: The canon of
Scripture is the list of all the books that belong in the Bible:
We must not underestimate the importance of this question: The
words of Scripture are the words by which we nourish our spiritual
lives. Thus we can reaffirm the comment of Moses t0 the people of
Israe
in reference t0 the words of God s law: "For it is nO trifle for
you_
buc
is your life, and thereby YOu shall live
in the land
which you are going over the Jordan t0 possess
(Deut: 32.47).
To add to or subtract from God's words would be to prevent God' $
people from obeying him fully; for commands that were subtracted
would not be known t0 the people_
and words that were added
might require extra
of the people which God had not
commanded: Thus Moses warned the people of Israel; "You shall
add to the word which
command YOu, nor take from it; that
you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which
command you'
(Deut: 4.2)
The precise determination of the extent of the canon of Scripture is
therefore of the utmost importance_
If we are t0 trust and obey God
absolutely we must have
collection of words that we are certain
are God' $ own words [0 uS_
If there are any sections of Scripture
about which we have doubts whether they are God'$ words or not,
we will not consider them t0 have absolute divine authority and we
will not trust them as much as we would trust God himself:

Old Teune
Canon
Where did the idea of
canon begin
tthe idea that the people of
Israel should preserve
collection of written words from God?
Scripture itself bears witness to the historical development of the
canon.
The earliest collection of written words of God was the Ten
Commandments
The Ten Commandments thus form the beginning
of the biblical canon. God himself wrote on two tablets of stone the
words which he commanded his people:
And he gave to Moses;
when he had made an end of speaking with him upon Mount Sinai;
the two tables of the testimony; tables of stone, written with the
finger of God" (Ex. 31:18). Again we read_
And the tables were
the work of God
and the writing was the writing of God, graven
upon the tables"
(Ex. 32.16; cf:
Deut. 413; 10.4). The tablets were
deposited in the ark of the covenant (Deut: 10.5) and constituted the
terms of the covenant between God and his people
This collection of absolutely authoritative words from God grew in
size throughout the time of Israel $ history. Moses himself wrote
additiona
words to be deposited beside the ark of the covenant
(Deut: 31.24-26). The immediate reference is apparently t0 the
book of Deuteronomy; but other references t0
by Moses
indicate that the first four books of the Old Testament were written
by him as well (see Ex. 17.14; 24.4; 34.27; Num 33.2; Deut:
31.22). After the death of Moses, Joshua also added to the
collection of written words of God:
Joshua wrote these words in
the book of the law of God" (Josh: 24.26). This is especially
surprising in light of the command not t0 add t0 0r take away from
the words which God gave the people through Moses:
You shall
not add t0 the word which
command you, nor take from
(Deut. 4.2; cf: 12.32). In order to have disobeyed such
specific
command, Joshua
have been convinced that he was nOL
taking
it upon himself to add to the written words of God_
but that God
himself had authorized such additional writing
Later; Others in Israel, usually those who fulfilled the office of
prophet; wrote additional
words from God:
Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he
wrole them in
book and laid
before the LORD
Sam. 10.25)
The acts of King David, from first to last; are written in the Chronicles
writing
MuSt

of Samuel the seer; and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet; and in
the Chronicles of Gad the seer: (1 Chron: 29.29)
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat; from first t0
are Written in
the chronicles of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the
Book of the
of Israel. (2 Chron: 20.34; cf:
16.7 where
Jehu the son of Hanani is called
prophet)
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first t0
Isaiah the prophet
the son of Amoz wrote.
(2 Chron. 26.22)
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold;
are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the
Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. (2 Chron. 32.32)
Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in
book all the words
that
have spoken to you:
(Jer: 30.2)
The content of the Old Testament canon continued t0 grow until the
time of the end of the writing process_
If we date
Haggai to 520
B.C.
Zechariah to 520-518 B.C. (with perhaps more material
added after 480 B.C.) and Malachi around 435 BC
we have an
idea of the approximate dates of the last Old Testament prophets.
Roughly coinciding with this period are the last books of Old
Testament history
Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther: Ezra went to
Jerusalem in 458 BC
and Nehemiah was in Jerusalem from 445-
433 BC_
Esther was written sometime after the death of Xerxes
Ahasuenus) in 465 B.C ; and
date during the reign of
Artaxerxes
(464-423 B.C.) is probable
after approximately
435 B.C. there
were no further additions
the Old Testament
canon: The subsequent
of the Jewish people was recorded in
other
writings, such as the books of the Maccabees; but these
writings were not thought worthy t0 be included with the
collections of God $ words from earlier years.
When we turn t0 Jewish literature outside the Old Testament; we
that the belief that divinely authoritative words from God had
ceased is clearly attested in several different strands of extrabiblical
Jewish literature. In
Maccabees (about 100 BC.) the author
writes of the defiled

altal ,
They apparently knew of no one who could speak with the
authority of God as the Old Testament prophets had done: The
memory of an authoritative prophet among the people was one that
belonged t0 the distant past, for the author could speak of
great
distress
such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased t0
appear among them
Macc: 9.27; cf: 14.41).
Josephus (bom
AD 37/38) explained,
"From Artaxerxes
own times
complete history has been written, but has not been
deemed worthy of equal credit with the earlier records, because of
the failure of the exact succession of the prophets'
(Against Apion
1.41). This statement by the greatest Jewish historian of the first
century AD. shows that he knew of the writings now considered
part of the
Apocrypha
but that he (and many of his
contemporaries_
considered these other writings
not
worthy of
equal credit" with what we now know as the Old Testament
Scriptures. There had been, in Josephus
viewpoint; no more
"words of God" added to Scripture after about 435 BC:
Rabbinic literature reflects
similar conviction in its repeated
statement that the Holy Spirit (in the Spirit's function of
inspiring
prophecy) departed from Israel.
After the latter prophets Haggai,
Zechariah_
and Malachi had died, the Holy Spirit departed from
Israel, but they still availed themselves of the bath gol"
(Babylonian 'Talmud, Yomah 9b, repeated in Sota 48b, Sanhedrin
Ila, and Midrash Rabbah on Song of Songs, 8.9.3).
The Qumran community (the Jewish sect that left behind the Dead
Sea Scrolls) also awaited
prophet whose words would have
authority tO supersede any existing
regulations (see
QS 9.11), and
other similar statements are found elsewhere in ancient Jewish
literature (see
Baruch 85.3 and Prayer of Azariah 15). Thus,
writings subsequent t0 about 435 B.C.

not accepted by the
Jewish people generally as having equal authority with the rest of
Scripture.
In the New Testament; we have no record of any dispute between
Jesus and the Jews over the extent of the canon. Apparently there
full agreement between Jesus and his disciples
on the one
hand, and the Jewish leaders
Jewish people, on the other hand,
that additions t0 the Old Testament canon had ceased after the time
of Ezra
Nehemiah, Esther; Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi: This
fact is confirmed by the quotations of Jesus and the New Testament
authors from the Old Testament: According to one count; Jesus and
the New Testament authors quote various parts of the Old
Testament Scriptures as divinely authoritative over 295 times,
but
not once do they cite any statement from the books of the
Apocrypha 0r any other writings as having divine authority.
The
absence of any such reference
other literature as divinely
authoritative, and the extremely frequent reference t0 hundreds of
places in the Old Testament as divinely authoritative, gives strong
confirmation t0 the fact that the New Testament authors agreed that
the established Old Testament canon,
MOrE
and no

be taken as God $ very words_
What then shall be said about the Apocrypha, the collection of
books included in the canon by the Roman Catholic Church but
excluded from the canon by
Protestantism?"
These books
Were
never accepted by the Jews as Scripture, but throughout the early
history of the church there was
divided opinion on whether
should be pait of Scripture or nOt. In
the earliest Christian
evidence is decidedly against viewing the Apocrypha as Scripture,
but the use of the Apocrypha gradually increased in some parts of
the church until the time of the Reformation_
The fact that these
books were included by Jerome in his Latin Vulgate translation of
the Bible (completed in A.D_
404) gave support t0 their inclusion,
even
though Jerome himself said they were not "books of the
canon'
but merely "books of the church" that were helpful and
useful for believers. The wide use of the Latin Vulgate in
subsequent centuries guaranteed their continued accessibility; but
the fact that
had no Hebrew origina_
behind them, and their
exclusion from the Jewish canon, aS well as the lack of their
citation in the New Testament; led many t0 view them with
suspicion or to reject their authority. For instance, the earliest
Christian list of Old Testament books that exists today
by Melito_
bishop of Sardis_
about AD 170:
When
came to the east and reached the place where these things
were preached and done_
and learnt accurately the books of the Old
Testament;

is noteworthy here that Melito names none of the books of the Apocrypha;
but he includes all of our present Old Testament books except Esther:
Eusebius also quotes Origen as affirming most of the books of Our present
Old Testament canon (including Esther) , but no book of the Apocrypha is
affirmed as canonical, and the books of Maccabees are explicitly said t0 be
outside of these [canonical books]
Similarly; in AD. 367, when the great
church leader Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria_
wrote his Paschal Letter; he
listed all the books of our present New Testament canon and all the books of
our present Old Testament canon except Esther: He also mentioned some
books of the Apocrypha such as the Wisdom of Solomon_
the Wisdom of
Sirach;
Judith, and Tobit, and said these are
nor indeed included in the
Canon; but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who newly join uS_
and who wish for instruction in the word of
godliness_
However; other
early church leaders did quote several of these books as Scripture_
There are doctrinal and historical inconsistencies with
number of
these books_
E. J Young notes:
[here are n0 marks in these books which
attest
divine
origin.
both Judith and Tobit contain historical, chronological and
geographical errors_
The books justify falsehood and deception and
make salvation to depend upon works of merit:
Ecclesiasticus and
the Wisdom of Solomon inculcate
morality based upon
expediency:
Wisdom teaches the creation of the world out of pre-existent matter
(11.17).
Ecclesiasticus teaches that the giving of alms makes
atonement for sin (3.30). In Baruch it is said that God hears the
prayers of the dead (3.4), and in
Maccabees there are historical and
geographical errors_
was not until 1546, at the Council of Trent, that the Roman
Catholic Church officially declared the Apocrypha to be part of the
canon
the exception of
and
Esdras and the Prayer of
Manasseh) It is significant that the Council of Trent was the

response of the Roman Catholic Church t0 the
of Martin
Luther and the rapidly spreading Protestant Reformation, and the
books of the Apocrypha contain support for the Catholic teaching

In affirming the Apocrypha as within the canon_
Roman
Catholics would hold that the church has the authority t0 constitute
literary work as "Scripture

church cannor make

iS nOL.
Only the official treasury of
nation can make money that is real
money; similarly; only God can make words to be his very words
and worthy of inclusion in Scripture:)
Thus the writings of the Apocrypha should not be regarded as
of Scripture: (1) they do not claim for themselves the same kind of
authority as the Old Testament writings; (2
were not
regarded
as God $ words by the Jewish people from whom
originated;
were not considered t0 be Scripture by Jesus Or the New
Testament authors; and (4) they contain
teachings inconsistent with
the rest of the Bible_
We must conclude that -
are merely human
words_
not God-breathed words like the words of Scripture. They
do have value tor historical
and linguistic research, and they
contain
number of helpful stories about the courage and faith of
many Jews during the period after the Old Testament ends_
but
have never been part of the Old Testament canon, and they should
not be thought of as part of the Bible
Therefore
they have no
binding authority for the thought or life of Christians today:
In conclusion, with
to the canon of the Old Testament;
Christians today should have no WOrry that
anything needed has
been left out or that anything that is not God $ words has been
included_

Scripture primarily occurs in connection with God'$ great acts in
redemptive history The Old Testament records and interprets for 4S
the
calling of Abraham and the lives of his descendants, the exodus
from Egypt and the wilderness wanderings, the establishment of
God'
the land ot Canaan
the establishment of the
monarchy; and the Exile and return from captivity.
Each of these
great acts of God in history is interpreted for US in God's Own
words in Scripture
The Old Testament closes with the expectation
of the Messiah t0 come (Mal. 31-4 41-6). The next
redemptive history is the coming of the Messiah, and it is not
surprising that no further Scripture would be written until this next
and greatest event in the history of redemption occured
This is why the New Testament consists of the writings of the
apostles:
It is primarily the apostles who are given the ability
the Holy Spirit to recall accurately the words and deeds of
Jesus and to interpret them rightly for subsequent
generations_
Jesus promised this empowering to his disciples (who were called
apostles after the resurrection) in John 14.26: "But the Counselor;
the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name
he will
teach you all
and bring to your remembrance all that
have
said t0 you_
Similarly, Jesus promised further revelation of truth
from the Holy Spirit when he told his disciples
"When the Spirit of
truth comes
he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not
on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak;
and he will declare to YOu the things that are
come. He Will
glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you"
(John 16.13-14). In these verses the disciples are promised amazing
gifts t0 enable them to write Scripture: the Holy Spirit would teach
them
would cause them
remember "all" that Jesus
had said_
and would guide them into
all the truth:
Furthermore
those who have the office of apostle in the early
church are seen
claim an authority equal tO that of the Old
Testament prophets
an authority tO

Similarly, Paul tells the Corinthians, "If any one thinks that he is
prophet; or spiritual; he should acknowledge that what

translated

Thus
Paul claims that his directives t0 the church
at Corinth are not merely his own but.
command of the Lord:
Later; in
defending his apostolic office, Paul says that he will give
the Corinthians "proof that Christ is
speaking in me
(2 Cor: 13.3).
Other similar verses could be mentioned (for example,
Rom_
2.16;
Gal: 1.8-9;
Thess. 2.13; 4.8, 15; 5.27;
Thess. 3.6, 14).
The apostles; then, have authority t0 write words that are God'$
own words, equal in truth status and authority to the words of the
Old Testament Scriptures_
[hey do this

But in this verse;
Peter classifies Paul's writings with the
other Scriptures" (meaning
the Old Testament Scriptures). Paul'$ writings are therefore
considered by Peter also 0 be worthy of the title "Scripture

thus worthy of inclusion
the canon:
A second instance is found in
Timothy 5.17-18. Paul says,

The first

is found in Deuteronomy 25.4, but the
second quoration;, "The laborer deserves his wages_
is found
nowhere in the Old Testament It does occur; however; in Luke 10.7
(with exactly the same words in the Greek text) So here
have
Paul apparently quoting
portion of Luke'$ gospel
and
calling it
"Scripture
thac is_
something that is to be considered part of the
canon.
In both of these passages (2
3.16 and
Tim. 5.17 -
18) we see evidence that
early in the history of the church the
of the New Testament
began to be accepted as part of the
canon.
Because the apostles
by virtue of their apostolic office; had
authority to write words of Scripture; the authentic written
of the apostles were accepted by the early church as part
of the canon of Scripture
If we accept the arguments for the
traditional views of authorship of the New Testament writings
then we have most of the New Testament in the canon because of
direct authorship by the apostles:
would include Matthewz
John; Romans to Philemon (all of the Pauline epistles); James;
and
Peter;
2, and 3 John; and Revelation:
This leaves five books
Mark, Luke,
Acts
Hebrews
and Jude;
which were not written by apostles_
The details of the historical
process by which these books came t0 be counted as part of
Scripture by the early church are scarce_
but Mark; Luke; and Acts
were commonly acknowledged very early; probably because of the
close association of Mark
the apostle Peter; and of Luke (the
author of Luke-Acts) with the apostle Paul. Similarly, Jude
apparently was accepted by virtue of the author
connection with

with -
James (see Jude 1) and the fact that he was the brother of Jesus:
The acceptance of Hebrews as canonical was urged by many in the
church on the basis of an assumed Pauline authorship_
But from
very early times there were others who rejected Pauline authorship
in favor of one or another of several different suggestions. Origen,
who died about AD 254_
mentions various theories of authorship
and concludes, "But who actually wrote the epistle, only God
knows
Thus, the acceptance of Hebrews as canonical was not
entirely due to
belief in Pauline authorship Rather; the intrinsic
qualities of the book itself must have finally convinced early
readers _
as they continue to convince believers today; that whoever
its human author may have been; its ultimate author can only have
been God himself The majestic glory of Christ shines forth from
the pages of the epistle to the Hebrews so brightly that no believer
who reads
seriously should ever want to question its place in the
canon.
This brings 4S t0 the heart of the question of canonicity For
book
belong in the canon
it is absolutely necessary that the book have
divine authorship. If the words of the book are God'$ words
(through human authors), and if the early church, under the
direction of the apostles, preserved the book as
of Scripture;
then the book belongs in the canon.
But if the words of the book are
not God'$ words
does nOL
belong in the canon. The question of
authorship by an apostle
impontant because it was primarily the
apostles
whom Christ gave the ability to write words with
absolute divine authority: If _
can be shown to be by an
apostle; then its absolute divine authority is automatically
established:
Thus, the early church automatically accepted as part
of the canon the written teachings of the apostles which the apostles
wanted preserved as Scripture
But the existence of some New Testament writings that were not
authored directly by apostles shows that there were others in the
early church to whom Christ also gave the ability; through the work
of the Holy Spirit; t0 write words that were God $ own words and
also therefore intended to be part of the canon: In these cases; the
early church had the task of recognizing which writings had the
characteristic of being God $ Own words (through human authors).
parte
writing
For some books (at least Mark; Luke, and Acts, and perhaps
Hebrews and Jude as well), the church had, at least in some areas_
the personal testimony of some living apostles to affirm the
absolute divine authority of these books
For example_
Paul would
have aftirmed the authenticity of Luke and Acts
and Peter would
have affirmed the authenticity of Mark as containing the gospel
which he himself preached. In other cases
and in some
geographical areas
the church simply had to decide whether it
heard the voice of God himself speaking in the words of these
writings. In these cases_
the words of these books would have been
self-attesting; that is_
the words would have borne witness [0 their
own divine authorship as Christians read them. This seems to have
been the case with Hebrews.
should not surprise us that the early church should have been able
recognize Hebrews and other writings_
nor written by apostles_
God'$ very words- Had not Jesus said "My sheep hear my voice
(John 10.27)? It should not be thought impossible or unlikely;
therefore
that the early church would be able to use
combination
of factors,
including apostolic endorsement; consistency with the
rest of
Scripture, and the perception of
writing as "God-breathed"
on the pait of an
overwhelming majority of believers, to decide that
writing
Wds
in fact God'$ words (through
human author) and
therefore worthy of inclusion
the canon
Nor should it be thought
unlikely that the church would be able
use this process over
period of time
writings were circulated t0 various parts of the
early church
and finally t0 come t0
completely correct decision;
without
excluding any writings that were in fact "God-breathed"
and withour
including any that were not.
In AD 367 the Thirty-ninth Paschal Letter of Athanasius contained
an exact list of the twenty-seven New Testament books we have
today This was the list of books accepted by the churches in the
eastern part of the Mediterranean world. Thirty years later; in AD
397_
the Council of Carthage, representing the churches in the
wester part of the Mediterranean world, agreed with the eastern
churches on the same list: These are the earliest final lists of our
present-day canon
Should we expect any more
t0 be added t0 the canon? The
opening sentence
Hebrews puts this question in the proper
historical
perspective, the perspective of the history of redemption:
wtitings _
"In many and various ways God
of old t0 our fathers by the
prophets; but in these last days he has spoken t0 us by
Son, whom
he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created
the world" (Heb: 1.1-2).
The contrast between the former speaking
of old" by the prophets
and the recent
speaking "in these last days" suggests that God's
speech to us by his Son is the culmination of his speaking to
mankind and is his greatest and final
revelation t0 mankind in this
period of redemptive history: The exceptional greatness of the
revelation that comes through the Son, far exceeding any revelation
in the old covenant; is emphasized again and
throughout
chapters
and 2 of Hebrews- These facts all indicate that there is
finality t0 the revelation of God in Christ and that once this
revelation has been completed, no more is t0 be expected_
But where do we learn about this revelation through Christ? The
New Testament -
contain the final, authoritative_
and
sufficient interpretation of Christ'$ work of redemption. The
apostles and their close companions report Christ'$ words and
deeds and interpret them with absolute divine authority. When they
have finished their
there is no more
be added with the
same absolute divine authority: Thus_
once the
of the New
Testament apostles and their authorized companions are completed_
we have in written form the final record of everything that God
wants US to know about the life, death, and resurrection of Christ,
and its meaning for the lives of believers for all time. Since this is
God's greatest revelation for mankind
more is t0 be expected
once this is complete.
In this way; then_
Hebrews 1:1-2 shows uS
why no more
can be added t0 the Bible after the time of
the
Testament The canon is nOw closed
A similar kind of consideration may be drawn from Revelation
22.18-19:
warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if
any one adds to them; God will add to him the
plagues described in
this book, and if any one takes away from the words of the book of
this prophecy; God will take away his share in the tree of life and in
the holy city; which are described in this book
The primary reference of these verses is clearly to the book of
spoke
again
writings
writing:
wuitings
writings
New
Revelation itself, for John refers t0 his
as "the words of the
prophecy of this book" in verses
and 10 of this chapter (and the
entire book is called
prophecy in Rev: 1.3). Furthermore_
the
reference [0 "the tree of life and
the holy city; which are
described in this book" indicates that the book of Revelation itself
intended:
It is, however; not accidental that this statement comes at the end of
the last chapter 0f Revelation, and that Revelation is the last book
in the New Testament: In fact; Revelation has to be placed last in
the canon: For many books, their placement in the
assembling of
the canon is of little consequence_
But just as Genesis must be
placed first (for it tells us of creation), so Revelation must be placed
last (for its focus is tO tell uS of the future and God' $ new creation).
The events described in Revelation are historically subsequent to
the events described in the rest of the New Testament and require
that Revelation be placed where it is. Thus_
not inappropriate
for uS to understand this exceptionally strong warning at the end of
Revelation as
applying in
secondary way t0 the whole of
Scripture. Placed here, where
must be placed, the warning forms
appropriate conclusion t0 the entire canon of Scripture. Along
with Hebrews 1:1-2 and the history-of-redemption perspective
implicit in those verses, this broader application of Revelation
22.18-19 also suggests t0 4S that we should expect no more
Scripture t0 be added beyond what we already have_
How do
know; then, that we have the right books in the canon of
Scripture we
MUY
possess? The question can be answered in [WO
different ways:
if we are
upon what we should base
OuI confidence
the answer must ultimately be that our confidence
is based on the faithfulness of God. We know that God loves his
people, and
is supremely important that God's people have his
own words_
for they are our life (Deut: 32.47
Matt: 4.4).
are
more precious
more important tO uS than anything else in this
world_
We also know that God our Father is in control of all history;
and he is nOt the kind of Father who will trick uS or fail t0 be
faithful 0 4S 0r
from 4s something we absolutely need_
The severity of the punishments in Revelation 22.18-19 that come
those who add t0 0r take from God's words also confirms the
importance for God '=
people of having
correct canon. There could
be no greater punishments than these
for they are the punishments
writing
Fitsl;
asking "
They
keep
of eternal
judgment This shows that God himself places supreme
value on our having
correct collection of God-breathed writings_
no more and no less. In the light of this fact, could it be right for uS
to believe that God our Father; who controls all history; would
allow all of his church for almost tWo thousand years t0 be deprived
of something he himself values so highly and is s0 necessary for
our spiritual lives?
The preservation and correct assembling of the canon of Scripture
should ultimately be seen by believers
then
not as part of church
history subsequent t0 God's great central acts of redemption for his
people, but as an integral part of the history of redemption itself:
Just as God was at wOrk in creation, in the
calling of his
Israel, in the life, death; and resurrection of Christ; and in the early
work and writings of the apostles_
God was at work in the
preservation and assembling together of the books of Scripture for
the benefit of his people for the entire church age. Ultimately; then;
we base our confidence in the correctness of our present canon on
the faithfulness of God
The question of how we know that we have the right books can,
secondly; be answered in
somewhat different way: We might wish
focus on the process by which we become persuaded that the
books
have nOw in the canon are the right ones_
In this process
TWO
factors are at work: the activity of the Holy Spirit
convincing
uS as we read Scripture for ourselves_
and the historical data that we
have available for our consideration
As we read Scripture the Holy Spirit works
convince US that the
books we have in Scripture are all
God and are his words
4s. It has been the testimony of Christians throughout the
that
read the books of the Bible
the words of Scripture speak to
their hearts as no other books do. Day after day; year after year;
Christians find that the words of the Bible are indeed the words of
God speaking t0 them with an authority;
power; and
persuasiveness that no other writings possess. Truly the Word of
God is "living and active
sharper than any two-edged sword_
piercing to the division of soul and
of joints and marrow; and
discerning
the
thoughts and intentions of the heart" (Heb. 4.12).
Yet the process by which
become persuaded that the present
canon is right is also helped by historical data.
Of course, if the
people
from
ages
they
spirit,
assembling of the canon was one part of God's central acts in the
history of redemption (as was stated above), then Christians today
should not presume
take it upon themselves t0 attempt t0 add
subtract from the books of the canon: the process was completed
long ag0_
Nevertheless_
thorough investigation of the historical
circumstances surounding the
assembling of the canon is helpful in
confirming
conviction that the decisions made by the early
church were correct decisions_
Some of this historical data has been
mentioned in the preceding pages
Other; more detailed data is
available for those who wish tO pursue more specialized
investigations_
Yet one further historical fact should be mentioned. Today there
exist nO strong candidates for addition tO the canon and no strong
objections t0 any book presently in the canon. Of those writings
that some in the early church wanted t0 include in the canon, it is
safe t0 say that there are none that present-
evangelicals would
want t0 include.
Some of the very early writers distinguished
themselves
clearly trom the apostles and their
trom
the writings of the apostles. Ignatius, for example; about AD. 110,
said, "Ido not order You as did Peter and Paul; they were apostles,
am
convict;
were
am even until now
slave"
(Ignatius, To the Romans, 4.3; compare the attitude tOward the
apostles in
Clement 42.1,
2; 44.1-2 [AD 95]; Ignatius,
To the
Magnesians_
7.1; 13.1-2; et al.)
Even those writings that were for
time thought by some t0 be
worthy of inclusion in the canon contain doctrinal
that is
contradictory
the rest of Scripture
"The Shepherd" of Hermas
for example, teaches
necessity of
penance
and
possibility
of the forgiveness of sins at least once after baptism
The author
seems t0 identify the Holy Spirit with the Son of God before the
Incaration, and t0 hold that the Trinity came into existence only
after the humanity of Christ had been taken up into heaven'
Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,
641).
The Gospel of Thomas, which for
time was held by some to
belong
the canon, ends with the following absurd statement (par:
114):
Simon Peter said t0 them: "Let
g0 away from US, for women are
not worthy of life_
Jesus said: "Lo,

male; that she t0o may become
living spirit; resembling
yOu males. For every woman who makes herself
male will enter the
kingdom of heaven:
All other existing documents that had in the early church any
possibility of inclusion in the canon are similar t0 these
that they
either contain explicit disclaimers of canonical status or include
some doctrinal aberrations that clearly make them unworthy of
inclusion in the Bible_
On the other hand_
there are no strong objections
any book
currently in the canon. In the case of several New Testament books
that were slow t0
gain approval by the whole church (books such as
Peter 0r 2 and
John), much of the early hesitancy over their
inclusion can be attributed t0 the fact that they were not initially
circulated
widely; and that
knowledge of the contents of
all the New Testament
spread through the church rather
slowly: (Martin Luther"
hesitancies concerning James are quite
understandable in view
the doctrina
controversy
which he
Was
engaged_
but such hesitancy was certainly not necessary The
apparent doctrinal conflict with Paul $
is easily resolved
once it is recognized that James is using three key terms_
justification; faith, and works in senses different from those with
which Paul used them:)
There is therefore historical confirmation for the correctness of the
current canon: Yet it must be remembered in connection with any
historical investigation that the work of the early church was not to
bestow divine authority 0r even ecclesiastical authority upon some
merely human
but rather to
recognize the divinely
authored characteristic of writings that already had such
quality:
This is because the ultimate criterion of canonicity is divine
authorship, not human 0r ecclesiastical
approval.
At this point someone may ask
hypothetical question about what
should do
another one
of Paul'$ epistles were discovered, for
example.
Would we add it to Scripture? This is
difficult question,
because [WO
conflicting considerations are involved:
On the one
hand, if
great majority of believers were convinced that this was
indeed an authentic Pauline epistle, written in the course of Paul $
fulfillment of his apostolic office_
then the nature of Paul $ apostolic
full

writings
teaching
wtitings,
authority would guarantee that the
would be God'$ very
words (as well as Paul's), and that its teachings would be consistent
with the rest of Scripture. But the fact that it was nOt preserved as
part of the canon would indicate that it was not among the writings
the apostles wanted the church to preserve as
of Scripture_
Moreover;
must immediately be said that such
hypothetical
question
just that: hypothetical. It is exceptionally difficult to
imagine what kind of historical data might be discovered that could
convincingly demonstrate t0 the church as
whole that
letter lost
for over 1,900 years was genuinely authored by Paul, and it is more
difficult still to understand how our sovereign God could have
faithfully cared for his people for over
900 years and still allowed
them t0 be continually deprived of something he intended them
have as part of his final revelation of himself in Jesus Christ: These
considerations make it s0 highly improbable that any such
manuscript would be discovered at some time in the future
that
such
hypothetical question really does not merit further serious
consideration.
In conclusion, are there any books in our present canon that should
not be there? No_
We can rest Our confidence in this fact in the
faithfulness of God our Father; who would not lead all his people
for nearly two thousand years to trust as his Word something that is
not: And we find our confidence repeatedly confirmed both by
historical investigation and by the work of the Holy Spirit in
enabling
uS t0 hear God $ voice in
unique way as we read from
every one of the sixty-six books in our present canon of Scripture
But are there any
missing books
books that should have been
included in Scripture but were not? The answer must be no_
In all
known literature there are no candidates that even come close t0
Scripture when consideration is given both to their doctrinal
consistency with the rest of Scripture and to the type of authority
they claim for themselves (as well as the way those claims of
authority have been received by other believers). Once again, God $
faithfulness to his people convinces US that there is
from Scripture that God thinks we need to know for obeying him
and trusting him fully: The canon of Scripture today is exactly what
God wanted it [0 be _
and it will stay that way until Christ returns.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Why is
important to your Christian life to know which writings are
writing-
part
nothing
mnissing
God $ words and which are not? How would your relationship with God
be different if you had to look for his words that were scattered among
all the writings of Christians throughout church history? How would
your Christian life be different if God's words were contained not only in
the Bible but also in the official declarations of the church throughout
history?
Have you had doubts or questions about the canonicity of any of the
books of the Bible? What caused those questions? What should one do to
resolve them?
Mormons_
Jehovah's Witnesses; and members of other cults have

those claims? In practice, do these people treat the Bible as

Chapter
The Four Characteristics of Scripture: (1)
Authority
How do we know that the Bible is God'$ Word?
In the previous chapter our
was 0 determine which writings
belong in the Bible and which
do not: But once
have
determined what the Bible is_
our next step is t0 ask what it is like
What does the whole Bible teach us about itself?
The major
of the Bible about itself can be classified into
four characteristics (sometimes termed attributes): (1) the authority
of Scripture; (2) the clarity of Scripture; (3) the necessity of
Scripture; and
the sufficiency of Scripture_
with
to the first characteristic, most Christians would agree
that the Bible is our authority in some sense. But in exactly what
sense does the Bible claim to be our authority? And how do we
become persuaded that the claims of Scripture t0 be God s Word are
true? These are the questions addressed in this chapter:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The authority of Scripture means that all the words
Scripture are
God $ words in such
way that I0 disbelieve or disobey any word of
Scripture is to disbelieve or disobey God.
This definition may nOw be examined in its various parts.
Kn
LnTdr
~CNpuTe ArE Godl
Klnror
1. This Is What the Bible Claims for Itself: There are frequent claims in the
Bible that all the words of Scripture are God'$ words (as well as words that
were written down by men)
In the Old Testament, this is frequently seen in
the introductory phrase; "Thus says the LORD_
which appears hundreds of
goal
writings
reachings
regard =
times_
the world of the Old Testament; this phrase would have been
recognized as identical in form to the phrase,
Thus says king
which
Wds
used
preface the edict of
king to his subjects, an edict that could not
be challenged or questioned but that simply had to be obeyed_
Thus,
when
the prophets say,
Thus says the Lord,
they are claiming t0 be messengers
from the sovereign
of Israel, namely; God himself;, and they are claiming
that their words are the absolutely authoritative words of God_
When
prophet spoke in God s name in this way; every word he spoke had t0 come
from God_
or he would be
false prophet (cf: Num 22.38; Deut: 18.18-20;
Jer: 1.9; 14.14; 23.16-22; 29.31-32; Ezek: 2.7; 13.1-16).
Furthermore, God is often said t0 speak
'through" the prophet
Kings 14.18; 16.12
34; 2 Kings 9.36; 14.25; Jer: 37.2; Zech. 7:7
12). Thus_
what the prophet says in God'$ name_
God says
13.26 with v 21;
21.19 with 2
9.25-26; Hag:
1.12;
Sam: 15.3, 18) . In these and other instances in the Old
Testament; words that the prophets spoke can equally be referred to
aS words that God himself
Thus, t0 disbelieve or
disobey
anything
prophet says is t0 disbelieve
disobey God himself
(Deut: 18.19;
Sam: 10.8; 13.13-14; 15.3,19,23;
Kings 20.35,
36).
These verses of course do not claim that all the words in the Old
Testament are God $ words, for these verses themselves are
referring only to specific sections of spoken or written words in the
Old Testament: But the cumulative force of these passages,
including the hundreds of passages that begin
Thus says the Lord;
is [0 demonstrate that within the Old Testament we have written
records f words that are said t0 be God $ Own words.
These words
when written down constitute large sections of the Old Testament
In the New Testament,
number of passages indicate that all of the
Old Testament writings are thought of as God s words_
Second
Timothy 3.16 says,
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for
teaching; rebuking; correcting and training in righteousness'
(NIV)
Here
Scripture'
(graphe) must refer to the Old Testament
written Scripture
for that is what the word graphe refers t0 in every
one of its fifty-one occurrences in the New Testament:
Furthermore, the
sacred writings'
of the Old Testament are what
Paul
has just referred t0 in verse 15.
King
Kings
Kings
Kings
spoke:
Paul here affirms that all of the Old Testament writings are
theopneustos_
breathed out by God.
Since it is writings that are
said to be
breathed out;
this breathing must be understood as
metaphor for speaking the words of Scripture
This verse thus states
in brief form what was evident
many passages in the Old
Testament: the Old Testament writings are regarded as God 's Word
in written form: For every word of the Old Testament; God is the
one who
(and still speaks) it; although God used human
agents
write these words down:
A similar indication of the character of all Old Testament writings
as God $ words
found in 2 Peter 1:21. Speaking of the prophecies
of Scripture
20), which means at least the Old Testament
Scriptures tO which Peter encourages his readers to give careful
attention
19) , Peter says that none of these prophecies ever came
"by the impulse of man;
but thar
moved Dy the
Spirit
spoke from God
It is not Peter'
intention t0
completely
human volition or personality in the
of Scripture (he says
that the men
spoke'
but rather
say that the ultimate source of
every prophecy was never
man'$ decision about what he wanted
to write, but rather the Holy Spirit $ action in the prophet's life,
carried out in ways unspecified here (01; in
elsewhere in
Scripture). This indicates
belief that all of the Old Testament
prophecies
in light of vv: 19-20_
this probably includes all of
the written Scripture of the Old Testament) are spoken "from God" =
that is, they are God $ Own words
Many other New Testament passages speak in similar ways about
sections of the Old Testament: In Matthew 1.22.
[saiah's words in
Isaiah 7.14 are cited as
what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
In Matthew 4.4 Jesus says t0 the devil,
shall not live by bread
alone_
but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.
the context of Jesus' repeated citations from Deuteronomy t0
4nswer
temptation, the words that proceed
the mouth
of God" are the written Scriptures of the Old Testament:
In Matthew 19.5
the words of the author in Genesis 2.24,not
attributed to God
the Genesis narrative, are quoted by Jesus as
words thar God "said:
In Mark 7.9-13, the same Old Testament
passage can be called interchangeably "the commandment of God,
what "Moses said,
word of God:
In Acts 1:16, the
words of Psalms 69 and 109 are said t0 be words which "the
spoke
~mien
Holy
deny
writing
fact;
(and;
"Man
"from
every
"the
Holy
Spirit
beforehand by the mouth of David
Words f
Scripture are thus said to be spoken by the Holy Spirit. In Acts
2.16-17, in quoting
what was spoken by the prophet Joel" in Joel
2.28
Peter inserts
God declares_
thus
attributing
to God
words written by Joel, and claiming that God is presently saying
them:
Many other passages could be cited (see Luke 1:70; 24.25; John
5.45-47; Acts 3.18, 21; 4.25; 13.47; 28.25; Rom: 1.2; 3.2; 9.17;
Cor: 9.8-10; Heb: 1.1-2, 6 _
but the pattern of attributing to God
the words of Old Testament Scripture should be very clear:
Moreover; in severa
places it is all of the words of the prophets or
the words of the Old Testament Scriptures that are said to compel
belief or to be from God (see Luke 24.25,27, 44; Acts 3.18; 24.14;
Rom: 15.4).
But if Paul meant only the Old Testament writings when he spoke
Scripture'
in 2 Timothy 3.16, how can this verse apply to the
New Testament writings as well? Does it say
anything about the
character of the New Testament writings? To answer that question,
must realize that the Greek word graphe
scripture
was
technical
term for the New Testament writers and had
very
specialized meaning
Even though it is used fifty-one times in the
New Testament, every one of those instances uses it to refer t0 the
Old Testament writings, not tO any other words or writings Outside
the canon of Scripture_
Thus_
everything that belonged in the
category
scripture
had the character of being
breathed" :
words
God $ very words.
But at two places in the New Testament we see New Testament
writings also being called
scripture
along with the Old Testament
writings_
As we noted in chapter 3, in 2 Peter 3.16, Peter shows not
only an awareness of the existence of written epistles from Paul, but
also
clear willingness to classify "all of his [Paul 's] epistles
with
other scriptures.
This is an indication that very early in the
history of the church all of Paul $ epistles were considered to be
God'$ written words in the same sense aS the Old Testament texts
were. Similarly, in
Timothy 5.18, Paul quotes Jesus"
words as
found in Luke 10:7 and calls them
scripture.
These Lwo passages taken together indicate that during the time of
the writing of the New Testament documents there was an
spoke
~God-C
Were
"the
awareness
that additions were being made to this special category
of writings called
scripture
writings that had the character of
being God'$
words_
Thus
once we
establish that
New
Testament
belongs to the special category
scripture_
then
we are correct in applying
Timothy 3.16 to that writing as well,
and saying that that writing also has the characteristic Paul
attributes [0
all scripture"
it is
God-breathed;'
and all its words
are the very words of God:
there further evidence that the New Testament writers thought of
their own
(not just the Old Testament) as
words of
God? In some cases, there is_
Corinthians 14.37
Paul says; "If
any one thinks that he is
prophet, or spiritual, he should
acknowledge that what
am writing to YOU is
command of the
Lord:
Paul has here instituted
number of rules for church
worship at Corinth and has claimed for them the status of
commands of the Lord;
for the phrase translated "what
am
contains
plural relative pronoun in Greek (ha) and
is more literally translated "the
you are
command of the Lord
One objection to
the words of New Testament writers a5
words of God is sometimes brought from
Corinthians 7:12, where
Paul distinguishes his words from words of the Lord:
To the rest
say, not the Lord
A proper understanding of this passage
from verses 25 and 40
however: In verse 25 Paul says he
has no command of the Lord concerning the unmarried but will
give his own opinion. This must mean that he had possession of no
earthly word that Jesus had spoken on this subject and probably
also that he had received no subsequent revelation about it from
Jesus. This is unlike the situation in verse 10 where he could simply
repeat the content of Jesus' earthly teaching; "that the
should
separate from her husband" and "that the husband should not
divorce his wife.
Thus
verse 12 muSt mean that Paul has no
record 0f any earthly teaching of Jesus on the subject of
believer
who
married [0 an
unbelieving spouse:
Therefore, Paul gives his
own instructions: " T[o the rest
say; not the Lord, that if any brother
has
wife who
an unbeliever; and she consents t0 live with him;
he should not divorce her"
Cor: 7.12).
It is remarkable therefore that Paul can g0 0n in verses 12-15 t0
give several specific ethical standards for the Corinthians _
Whal
very
writing '
writings
being
writing
you "
things
writing -
seeing
gained
wife
gave him the right to make such moral commands? He said that he
spoke as one
who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy" (1 Cor:
7.25). He seems to imply here that his considered judgments were
able to be placed on the same authoritative level as the words of
Jesus. Thus,
Corinthians 7.12, "To the rest
say; not the Lord,
amazingly strong affirmation of Paul $ own authority: if he did
not have any words of Jesus t0 apply to
situation, he would
simply use his own words_
for his own words had just as much
authority as the words of Jesus!
Indications of
similar view of the New Testament
are
found in John 14.26 and 16.13, where Jesus promised that the Holy
Spirit
bring all that he had said to the disciples' remembrance
and would guide them into all the truth This indicates
special
superintending work of the Holy Spirit whereby the disciples would
be able to remember and record without error all that Jesus had
said. Similar indications are also found in
Peter 3.2;
Corinthians
2.13;
Thessalonians 4.15; and Revelation 22.18-19
We Are Convinced of the Bible's Claims to Be God's Words as We
Read the Bible: It is one thing to affirm that the Bible claims to be the words
of God
Ic is another
be convinced that those claims are true:
Our
ultimate conviction that the words of the Bible are God's words comes only
when the Holy Spirit speaks in and through the words of the Bible t0 our
hearts and gives US an inner assurance that these
the words of our Creator
speaking
to uS. Just after Paul has explained that his apostolic speech consists
of words taught by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor: 2.13), he says, "The natural man
does not receive the
of the Spirit of God, for
are folly to him, and
he is not able t0 understand them because
are spiritually discerned"
Cor: 2.14). Apart from the work of the Spirit of God
person will nOL receive
spiritual truths and
particular
nOr receive 0r accept the truth that the
words of Scripture are in fact the words of God
But for those in whom God's Spirit is working there is
recognition
that the words of the Bible are the words of God_
This process is
closely analogous to that by which those who believed in Jesus
knew that his words were tnue
He said, "My sheep hear my voice,
and
know them_
and they follow me
(John 10.27). Those who are

It is important t0 remember that this conviction that the words of
Scripture are the words of God does not come apart from the words
of Scripture Or
addition t0 the words of Scripture
It is not as if
the Holy Spirit one
whispers in OUr ear; "Do you see that Bible

know that the words of that
Bible are God'$ words
It is rather as people read Scripture that
hear their Creator'$ voice
speaking
them in the words of
Scripture and realize that the book they are
is unlike any
other book; that it is indeed
book of God'$ own words speaking t0
their hearts:
Other Evidence Is Useful but Not Finally
Convincing;
The previous
section is nOt meant t0 deny the validity of other kinds of arguments that may
be used
support the claim that the Bible is God'
words_
It is helpful for uS
earn that the Bible is historically accurate, that it is internally consistent;
that
contains prophecies that have been fulfilled hundreds of years later; that
it has influenced the course of human history more than any other book; that it
has continued changing the lives of millions of individuals throughout its
history; that through it people come t0 find salvation; that it has
majestic
beauty and
profound depth of teaching unmatched by any other book; and
that
claims hundreds of times over t0 be God $
words. All of these
arguments and others are useful t0 uS and remove obstacles that might
otherwise come in the way 0f OuI
believing Scripture
But all of these
arguments taken individually or together cannot finally be convincing:
As the
Westminster Confession of Faith said in 1643-46,
We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church t0 an
high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture:
And the heavenliness
of the matter; the efficacy of the doctrine
the majesty of the style, the
consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is; t0 give all
glory to God), the full discovery
makes of the only way of man' $
salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies
and the entire
perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly
evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet notwithstanding-
our
persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority
thereof;
from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by
and with the Word in our hearts. (chap

The Words of Scripture Are Self-_
Attesting: Thus, the words of Scripture
are "self-attesting:
They cannot be "proved" to be God's words by appeal tO
any higher authority For if an appeal

accuracy or logical consistency) were used tO prove that the Bible is God $

(say,
Word, then the Bible itself would not be our highest or absolute authority: it
would be subordinate in authority to the thing
which we
appealed to prove
it to be God's Word. If we ultimately appeal to human reason; Or t0 logic; Or
historical accuracy; Or o scientific truth; as the authority by which
Scripture is shown to be God $ words, then we have assumed the thing t0
which
appealed to be
higher authority than God's words and one that is
more true 0r more reliable.
Objection: This Is
Circular Argument: Someone may object that
say
Scripture proves itself to be God $ words is t0 use
circular argument: we
believe that Scripture is God s Word because it claims to be that: And we
believe its claims because Scripture is God's Word: And we believe that it is
God's Word because it claims t0 be that, and s0 forth_
It should be admitted that this is
kind of circular argument
However; that does not make its use invalid
for all arguments for
absolute authority muSt ultimately appeal t0 that authority for
proof: otherwise the authority would not be an absolute or highest
authority. This problem is not unique tO the Christian who is
arguing for the authority of the Bible. Everyone either implicitly or
explicitly uses some kind of circular argument when defending his
her ultimate authority for belief:
Although these circular arguments are not always made explicit and
are sometimes hidden beneath lengthy discussions or are simply
assumed without proof, arguments for an ultimate authority in their
most basic form take on
similar circular appeal to that authority
itself; as some of the following examples show:
My reason is my ultimate authority because
seems reasonable t0
me t0 make it SO_
Logical consistency is my ultimate authority because it is logical t0
make it SO_
"The findings of human sensory experiences are the ultimate authority

senses have never discovered
anything else: thus, human sense
experience tells me that my principle is true.
know there can be no ultimate authority because
do not know of
any such ultimate authority:
In all of these arguments for an ultimate standard of truth; an absolute
authority for whal
believe; there is an element of circularity involved:
How then does
Christian;
anyone else_
choose among the
various claims for absolute authorities? Ultimately the truthfulness
of the Bible will commend itself as being far more persuasive than
other religious books (such as the Book of Mormon 0r the Qur'an),
than any other intellectual constructions of the human mind
(such as logic; human reason, sense experience, scientific
methodology; etc ) It will be more persuasive because in the actual
experience of life, all of these other candidates for ultimate
authority are seen t0 be inconsistent Or to have shortcomings that
disqualify them; while the Bible will be seen
be fully
accord
with all that we know about the world around uS, about ourselves
and about God.
The Bible will commend itself as being persuasive in this way; that
if we are
rightly about the nature of reality; our
perception of it and of ourselves_
and ouI
perception of God. The
trouble is that because of sin our perception and analysis of God
and creation is faulty. Sin is ultimately irrational, and sin makes uS
think incorrectly about God and about creation Thus; in a world
free from sin, the Bible would commend itself convincingly to all
people as God*s Word
But because sin distorts people'$ perception
of reality;
do nor
recognize Scripture for what
really is.
Therefore
requires the work of the Holy Spirit, overcoming the
effects of sin; t0 enable uS to be persuaded that the Bible is indeed
the Word of God and thar the claims
makes for itself are true.
Thus, in another sense, the argument for the Bible as God s Word
and our ultimate authority is not
typical circular argument The
process of persuasion is perhaps better likened t0
spiral in which
increasing knowledge of Scripture and increasingly correct
understanding of God and creation tend tO supplement one another
harmonious way; each tending
confirm the accuracy of the
other: This is not t0 say that our knowledge of the world around us
serves as
higher authority than Scripture, but rather that such
knowledge, if it is correct knowledge, continues t0 give greater and
greater assurance and deeper conviction that the Bible is the only
truly ultimate authority and that other competing claims for
ultimate authority are false:

This Does Not Imply Dictation From God
the Sole Means of
Communication: The entire preceding
of this chapter has argued that all
the words of the Bible are God $ words.
At this point
word of caution is
necessary. The fact that all the words of Scripture are God $ words should not
lead us t0 think that God dictated every word of Scripture
the human
authors_
When we say that all the words of the Bible are God's words
are
talking about the result of the process of bringing Scripture into
existence: To raise the question of dictation is t0 ask about the
process that led to that result or the manner by which God acted in
order [0 ensure the result that he intended
Ic must be emphasized
that the Bible does not speak of only one type of process Or one
manner by which God communicated t0 the biblical authors what
he wanted t0 be said. In fact, there is indication of
wide variery of
processes God used to bring about the desired result
A few scattered instances of dictation are explicitly mentioned in
Scripture.
When the apostle John saw the risen Lord in a vision on
the island of Patmos, Jesus spoke t0 him as follows: "To the
of the church in Ephesus write
(Rev: 2.1);
And to the angel of
the church in Smyrna write
(Rev: 2.8);
And t0 the
angel of the
church in Pergamum write
(Rev: 2.12). These are examples of
dictation pure and simple. The risen Lord tells John what
write,
and John writes the words he hears from Jesus
Something akin
this process
probably also seen occasionally in
the Old Testament prophets.
We read
[saiah,
Then the word of
the Lord came t0 Isaiah:
Go and say to Hezekiah; Thus says the
Lord, the God of David your father:
have heard your prayer;
have seen your tears; behold,
will add fifteen years t0
life.
will deliver you and this
out of the hand of the
of Assyria,
and defend this city'
(Isa. 38.4-6). The picture given us in this
narrative is that Isaiah heard (whether with his physical ear 0r with
very forceful impression made upon his mind is difficult to say)
the words God wanted him to say tO Hezekiah, and Isaiah;
God's messenger; then took those words and spoke them as he had
been instructed_
But in many other sections of Scripture such direct dictation from
God is certainly not the manner by which the words of Scripture
were caused t0 come into being: The author of Hebrews says that
part
angel
your
cily
king
acung =
God spoke to our fathers by the prophets "in many and various
ways
(Heb: 1:1) . On the opposite end of the spectrum from
dictation we have, for instance, Luke"
ordinary historical research
for writing his gospel. He says:
Inasmuch as many have undertaken
compile
narrative of the
which have been accomplished among US, just as they were
delivered to us by those who from the
beginning were eyewitnesses
and ministers of the word_
seemed
t0 me also, having followed
all things closely for some time past; [0 write an orderly account for
you, most excellent Theophilus_
(Luke 1.1-3)
This is clearly not _
process of dictation_
Luke used ordinary
processes of speaking
eyewitnesses and gathering historical data
in order that he might write an accurate account of the life and
of Jesus_
He did his historical research thoroughly;
listening
the reports f many eyewitnesses and evaluating his
evidence carefully The gospel he wrote emphasizes what he
thought important tO emphasize and reflects his own characteristic
style of writing_
In between these tWo extremes of dictation pure and simple on the
one hand, and ordinary historical research on the other hand
have many indications of various ways by which God
communicated with the human authors of Scripture_
In some cases
Scripture gives us hints of these various processes: it
dreams
of visions, of hearing the Lord'$ voice Or
standing
in the
council of the Lord;
also speaks of men who were with Jesus and
observed his life and istened t0 his
teaching;
men Whose memory
of these words and deeds was made completely accurate by the
working of the Holy Spirit as he brought things
their
remembrance (John 14.26). Yet in many other cases the manner
used by God
about the result that the words of Scripture
were his words is simply not disclosed to us_
Apparently many
different methods were used_
but it is not important that
discover precisely what these were in each case_
In cases where the ordinary human personality and
style of
the author were prominently involved_
as seems the case
the
major part of Scripture_
all that we are able to say is that God $
providential oversight and direction of the life of each author was
such that their personalities

The preceding section has argued that all the words in Scripture are
God'
words. Consequently; to disbelieve or disobey any word of
Scripture
to disbelieve 0r
disobey God himself: Thus_
Jesus can
rebuke his disciples for not believing the Old Testament Scriptures
(Luke 24.25). Believers are to keep or obey the disciples' words
(John 15.20: "If
my word, they will
yours also"
Christians are encouraged [0 remember "the commandment of the
Lord and Savior through your apostles'
(2 Peter 3.2). To disobey
Paul $ writings was to make oneself liable to church discipline
such as excommunication (2 Thess_
3.14) and spiritual punishment
(2 Cor: 13.2-3), including punishment from God (this is the
apparent sense of the passive verb "he is not recognized" in
Cor:
14.38). By contrast; God delights in everyone who "trembles
at his
word (Isa. 66.2).
Throughout the history of the church the greatest preachers have
been those who have
recognized that
have no authority in
themselves and have seen their task as being to explain the words of
Scripture and apply them clearly to the lives of their hearers. Their
preaching has drawn its power not from the proclamation of their
own Christian experiences 0r the experiences of others_
nor from
their own opinions
creative ideas_
rhetorical skills_
but from
God'$ powerful words.

Lie or Speak Falsely:
The essence of the authority of
Scripture is its ability tO compel uS t0 believe and to obey it and t0 make such
belief and obedience equivalent t0 believing and
God himself:
Because this is s0,it is needful to consider the truthfulness of Scripture_
since
believe all the words of Scripture implies confidence in the complete
truthfulness of the Scripture that we believe. Although this issue will be dealt
with more fully when we consider the inerrancy of Scripture (see chapter 5),
brief treatment is given here_
Since the biblical writers repeatedly affirm that the words of the
Bible, though human, are God $ Own words, it is appropriate t0 look
at biblicaB
texts that talk about the character of God $ words and to
apply these to the character of the words of Scripture. Specifically;
there are
number of biblical passages that talk about the
truthfulness of God's speech: Titus 1.2 speaks of "God, who never
lies
(more literally translated),
unlying God
Because
God is
God who cannot speak
~lie,
his words can always be
trusted
Since all of Scripture is spoken by God, all of Scripture
must be
just as God himself is: there can be no
untruthfulness in Scripture_
Hebrews 6.18 mentions tWo unchangeable
(God s oath and
his promise) "in which it is impossible for God to lie (author'$
translation).
Here the author says not merely that God does not lie,
but that it is nOt possible for him to lie: Although the immediate
reference is only t0 oaths and promises, if it is impossible for God
to lie in these utterances
then certainly it is impossible for him ever
to lie (for Jesus harshly rebukes those who tell the truth only when
under oath: Matt: 5.33-37; 23.16-22). Similarly; David says t0
God;
You are God_
and your words are true'
(2 Sam: 7.28).
2. Therefore All the Words in Scripture Are Completely True and
Without Error in
Part Since the words of the Bible are God'$ words
and since God cannot lie 0r speak falsely; it is correct tO conclude that there is
no untruthfulness r error in any
of the words of Scripture
We find this
affirmed several places in the Bible. "The words of the LORD are words that
are
silver refined in
furnace on the ground, purified seven times" (Ps_
12.6, author' =
translation). Here the psalmist uses vivid imagery to speak of
the undiluted purity of God $ words: there
imperfection in them
Also in
Proverbs 30.5
we read
"Every word of God proves true
he is
shield to
those who take refuge in him
It is nOt just some
the words of Scripture
that are true_
but every word_
In tact; God $ Word is fixed
heaven for all
obeying
"the
unlying:
things
Any
patt
pure,
etemity:
For ever; 0 LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens'
(Ps.
119.89). Jesus can speak of the eternal nature of his Own words:
~Heaven and
earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away'
(Matt. 24.35). God $
speech is placed in marked contrast t0 all human speech; for "God is not man_
that he should lie_
son of man, that he should
(Num: 23.19).
These verses affirm explicitly what was implicit in the requirement that we
believe all of the words of Scripture; namely; that there is no untruthfulness or
falsehood affirmed in any of the statements of the Bible_
God's Words Are the Ultimate Standard of Truth: In John 17 Jesus
prays t0 the
Father; "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth" (John
17.17).
This verse is interesting because Jesus does not use the adjectives
alethinos Or alethes
true
which we might have expected
t0 say;
Your
word is true_
Rather; he uses
noun, aletheia
truth'
to say that God' $
Word
not simply "true
but it is truth itself:
The difference is significant; for this statement encourages US t0
think of the Bible not simply as being
true
in the sense that ic
conforms tO some higher standard of truth, but rather to think of the
Bible as being itself the finab
standard of truth: The Bible is God $
Word_
and God'
Word is the ultimate definition of what
true and
what is nOr tnuez
God $ Word is itself truth: Thus we are t0 think of
the Bible as the ultimate standard of truth, the reference point by
which every other claim
truthfulness is t0 be measured: Those
assertions that conform with Scripture are "true
while those that do
not conform with Scripture are not true_
What then is truth? Truth is what God says, and we have what God
says (accurately but not exhaustively) in the Bible:
Might Some New Fact Ever Contradict the Bible? Will any new
scientific or historical fact ever be discovered that will contradict the Bible?
Here We can say with confidence that this will never happen_it is in fact
impossible_
If any supposed "fact" is ever discovered that is said to contradict
Scripture_
then (if we have understood Scripture rightly) that "fact" must be
false, because God
the author of Scripture, knows all true facts (past, present;
and future). No fact will ever turn up that God did not know about ages ag0
and take into account when he caused Scripture t0 be written. Every true fact
something that God has known already from all eternity and is something
that therefore cannot contradict God'$ speech in Scripture
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that scientific or historical
repent "
study (as well as other kinds of study of creation) can cause US [0
reexamine Scripture t0 see if it really teaches what we thought it
taught The Bible certainly does not teach that the earth was created
in the year 4004 B.C.
as some once thought (for the genealogical
lists in Scripture have gaps in them)
Yet it was in part historical,
archaeological, astronomical, and geological study that caused
Christians [0 reexamine Scripture to see if it really taught such
recent origin fOr the earth
Careful analysis of the biblical text
showed thar
did not teach this
Similarly; the Bible does nOt teach that the sun goes around the
earth; for it only uses descriptions of phenomena as
#e See
them
our
vantage point and does not purport t0 be describing the
of the universe from some arbitrary "fixed" point
somewhere out in space.
Yet until the study of astronomy advanced
enough t0 demonstrate the rotation of the earth on its axis, people
assumed that the Bible taught that the sun goes around the earth
Then the study of scientific data prompted
reexamination of the
appropriate biblical texts. Thus
whenever confronted with some
"fact" that is said tO contradict Scripture_
must not only examine
the data adduced to demonstrate the fact in question; we must also
reexamine the appropriate biblica
texts [0 see if the Bible really
teaches what we thought it tO teach:
We should never fear but always welcome any new facts that may
be discovered in any legitimate area of human research Or study:
For example, discoveries by archaeologists working in Syria have
brought to light the Ebla Tablets_
These extensive written records
from the period around 2000 B.C. will eventually throw great light
0n ouI
understanding of the world of the patriarchs and the events
connected with the lives of Abraham, Isaac; and Jacob. Should
Christians entertain any lingering apprehension that the publication
of such data will prove some fact in Genesis to be incorrect?
Certainly not! We should eagerly anticipate the publication of all
such data with the absolute confidence that if it is correctly
understood
will all be consistent with Scripture and will all
confirm the accuracy of Scripture_
No tnue fact will ever contradict
the words of the God who knows all facts and who never lies_
Wnten Scriptur
Our Final Authorir
It is important t0 realize that the final form in which Scripture
ftom
workings
remains authoritative is its written form: It was the words of God
written on the tablets of stone that Moses deposited in the ark of the
covenant: Later; God commanded Moses and subsequent prophets
[O write their words in
book
And it was written Scripture
(graphe) that Paul said was
God-breathed" (2 Tim. 3.16).
Similarly, it is Paul'$ writings that are
command of the Lord" (1
Cor: 14.37) and that could be classified with "the other scriptures"
(2 Peter 3.16) .
This is important because people sometimes (intentionally 0r
unintentionally) attempt t0 substitute some other final standard than
the written words of Scripture. For example, people will sometimes
refer to
'what Jesus really said" and claim that when we translate
the Greek words of the Gospels back into the Aramaic language
Jesus spoke_
we can
gain
better
understanding of Jesus'
wordS
than was given by the writers of the Gospels_
In fact; it is
sometimes said that this work of reconstructing Jesus
words in
Aramaic enables uS
correct the erroneous translations made by
the gospeL
authors.
In othel
cases_
people have claimed to know
what Paul really
thought"
even when that is different from the meaning of the words
he wrote_
have spoken of
what Paul should have said if he
had been consistent
the rest of his theology:
Similarly, others
have spoken of "the church situation t0 which Matthew was
and have attempted t0 give normative force either to that
situation or to the solution they think Matthew was attempting t0
bring about in that situation
In all of these instances we muSt admit that
about the words
or situations that lie "behind" the text of Scripture may at times be
helpful t0 US in understanding what the text means_
Nevertheless_
our hypothetical reconstructions of these words or situations can
never replace or compete with Scripture itself as the final authority,
nor should we ever allow them to contradict Or call into question
the accuracy of any of the words of Scripture_
We muSt continually
remember that we have in the Bible God's very words_
and we mSt
not try to "improve'
them
SuME
way; for this cannot be done_
Rather; we should seek t0 understand them and then trust them and
them with our whole heart.
QUESTIONS FOR
PERSONAL
APPLICATION
they

writing
asking -
obey
If you want t0 persuade someone that the Bible is God's Word, what do
you want that person to read more than any other piece of literature?
Who would try to make people want to disbelieve something in
Scripture? To disobey something in Scripture? Is there anything in the
Bible that yOu do not want to believe? To obey? If your answers to either
of the preceding LWo questions were positive_
what is the best way
approach and to deal with the desires you have in this area?
Do you know of any proven fact in all of history that has shown
something in the Bible to be false? Can the same be said about other
religious writings such as the Book of Mormon Or the Qur 'an? If you
have read in other books such as these
can you describe the spiritual
effecc

Compare that with the spiritual effect that
reading the Bible has on YOu. Can YOu say that when YOu read the Bible
you hear the voice of your Creator speaking
YOu in
way that is true
of no other book?
Do you ever find yourself believing something not because you have
external evidence for it but simply because
written in Scripture? [s
that proper faith,
according
to Hebrews 1:1? If you do believe
simply because Scripture says them, what do you think Christ will say to
you about this habit when you stand before his judgment seat? Do you
think that
and obeying everything that Scripture affirms will
ever lead yOu into sin or away from God s blessing in your life?

Chapter 5
The Inerrancy of Scripture
Are there any errors in the Bible?
Most books on systematic
theology have not included
separate
chapter on the inerancy of the Bible
The subject has usually been
dealt with under the heading of the authority of Scripture; and no
further treatment has been considered necessary: However; this
issue of inerrancy is of such concern in the
evangelical world today
that
warrants
separate chapter following our treatment of the
authority of the Word of God.
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Meaning
Inerrancy
We will not at this point repeat the arguments concerning the
authority of Scripture that were given in chapter
There it was
argued that all the words in the Bible are God s words, and that
therefore t0 disbelieve 0r
disobey any word in Scripture is t0
disbelieve or disobey God: It was
argued further that the Bible
clearly teaches that God cannot lie or speak falsely (2 Sam: 7:28;
Titus 1.2; Heb: 6.18). Therefore; all the words in Scripture are
claimed to be completely tnue and without error in any part (Num:
23.19; Pss_
12.6; 119.89_
96; Prov 30.5; Matt: 24.35). God*s words
are_
fact; the ultimate standard of truth (John 17.17).
Especially relevant at this
are those Scripture texts that
indicate the total truthfulness and reliability of God $ words_
The
promises of the LORD are promises that are pure, silver refined in
furnace on the ground, purified seven times'
(Ps. 12.6), indicates
the flawlessness or absolute reliability and purity of Scripture:
Similarly, "Every word of God proves true; he is
shield to those
who take refuge in him" (Prov 30.5) , indicates the truthfulness of
every word that God has spoken. Though error and at least partial
falsehood may characterize the speech of every human being; it is
the characteristic of God'$ speech even when spoken through sinful
point
human beings that it is never false and that it never affirms error:
"God is not man, that he should lie, or
son of man; that he should
repent" (Num. 23.19) was spoken by sinful Balaam specifically
about the prophetic words that God had spoken through his own
lips.
With evidence such as this we are nOw in
position t0 define
biblical inerrancy: The inerrancy of Scripture means that Scripture
in tne original manuscripts does not affirm anything Ihat is
contrary
fact
This definition focuses on the question of truthfulness and
falsehood in the language of Scripture. The definition
simple
terms just means that the Bible always tells the truth, and that it
always tells the truth concerning everything it talks about: This
definition does not mean that the Bible tells us every fact there
know about any
subject; but it affirms that what it does say
about any subject is true.
It is important t0 realize at the outset of this discussion that the
focus of this controversy is on the question of truthfulness in
speech: It must be
recognized that absolute truthfulness in speech is
consistent with some other types of statements
such as the
following:
The Bible Can Be Inerrant and Still Speak in the Ordinary Language
of Everyday Speech:
This is especially true in
scientific" or "historical"
descriptions of facts Or events. The Bible can speak of the sun rising and the
rain
falling because
the perspective of the speaker this is exactly what
happens. From the standpoint of an observer standing on the sun (were that
possible) or on some hypothetical
fixed" point in space; the earth rotates and
brings the sun into view, and rain does not fall downward but upward or
sideways or whatever direction necessary for it to be drawn by gravity toward
the surface of the earth: But such explanations are hopelessly pedantic and
would make ordinary communication impossible
From the standpoint of the
speaker; the sun does rise and the rain does fall, and these are perfectly true
descriptions of the natural phenomena the speaker observes_
similar consideration applies tO numbers when used in measuring
or in counting:
A reporter can say that 8,000 men were killed in
certain battle without thereby implying that he has counted
everyone and that there are not 7,999 or 8,001 dead soldiers. If
one
trom
roughly 8,000 died,
would of course be false
say that
6,000
died, but
would not be false in most contexts for
reporter t0 say
that 8,000 men died when in fact 7,823 0r 8,242 had died: the limits
of truthfulness would depend on the
degree of precision implied by
the speaker and expected by his original
hearers
is also true for measurements_
Whether
say;
don"
live tar
from my office,
01 "[live
little over
mile from my office
01 "[
live one mile from my office,
live 1.287 miles from my
office;
all four statements are still approximations
some degree
of accuracy: Further
degrees of accuracy might be obtained with
more
precise scientific instruments, but these would still be
approximations
certain degree of accuracy: Thus,
measurements also
in order t0 be true, should conform tO the
degree of precision implied by the speaker and expected by the
hearers in the original context: It should not trouble Us, then, to
affirm both that the Bible is absolutely truthful in everything
says
and that it uses ordinary language to describe natural phenomena or
[0 give approximations Or round numbers when those are
appropriate in the context:
We should also note that
language can make vague O1 imprecise
statements without
untiue.
live
litcle over
mile from my
office" is
vague and imprecise statement; but it is also inerrant:
there is nothing untrue about it. It does not affirm anything that is
contrary t0 fact: In
similar way; biblical statements can be
imprecise and still be totally true
Inerrancy has t0 do with
truthfulness
not with the degree of precision with which events are
reported.
The Bible Can Be Inerrant and Still Include Loose or Free Quotations
The method by which one person quotes the words of another person
procedure that in large part varies from culture t0 culture. In contemporary
American and British culture we are used t0
quoting
person $ exact words
when
enclose the statement in quotation marks (this is called direct
quotation). But when we use indirect quotation (with no quotation marks) we
only expect an accurate report of the substance of
statement. Consider this
sentence: "Elliot said that he would return home for supper right away:
The
sentence does not quote Elliot directly; but it is an acceptable and truthful
report of Elliot $ actua)
statement [0 his
father;
will come [0 the house [0 eat
in two minutes,
even though the indirect quotation included none of the
speaker'$ original words_
This
being
Written Greek at the time of the New Testament had no quotation
marks 0r
equivalent kinds of punctuation, and an accurate citation
of another person needed to include only
correct representation of
the content of what the person said (rather like our indirect
quotations):
Was
not expected t0 cite each word exactly. Thus_
inerrancy is consistent with loose or free quotations of the Old
Testament 0r of the words of Jesus_
for example; s0
as the
content is not false tO what was originally stated_
The original
writer did not ordinarily imply that he was using the exact words of
the speaker and only those, nor did the original hearers expect
verbatim quoration in such
reporting:
3. It Is Consistent With Inerrancy to Have Unusual or Uncommon
Grammatical Constructions in the Bible: Some of the language of Scripture
elegant and stylistically excellent: Other scripturae
contain the
rough-hewn language of ordinary people_
At times this includes
failure
follow the commonly accepted "rules" of grammatical expression (such as the
use of
plural
verb where grammatical rules would require
singular verb
the use of
feminine adjective where
masculine one would be expected_
different spelling for
word than the one commonly used, etc.) These
stylistically
grammatically irregular statements (which are especially found
in the book of Revelation) should not trouble uS, for
do not affect the
truthfulness of the statements under consideration:
statement can be
ungrammaticaba
but still be entirely true_
For example, an uneducaled
backwoodsman in some rural area may be the most trusted man in the county
even
though his grammar is pOor; because he has earned
reputation for
neven
telling
Similarly; there are
tew statements in
Scripture (in the
original languages
that are
ungrammatical (according to current standards of
proper grammar at that time)
but still inerrant because they are completely
true
The issue is truthfulness in speech:
50nX CuTent Challeices
[nemTano
In this section we examine the major objections that are commonly
made against the concept of inerrancy:
1. The Bible Is Only Authoritative for "Faith and Practice:
One of the
mOSL
frequent objections is raised by those who say that the purpose of
Scripture is t0 teach us in areas that concern "faith and practice" only; that is_
in areas that directly relate [0 our religious faith Or [0
ethical conduct_ This
position would allow for the possibility of false statements in Scripture_
example
in other areas such as in minor historical details 0r scientific facts
long
writings
they
these areas_
it is said, do not concern the purpose of the Bible;
which is t0
instruct 4S in what we should believe and how we are
live.
Its advocales
often prefer t0 say that the Bible is "infallible,
buc
hesitate t0 use the
word inerrant:
The response to this objection can be stated as follows: the Bible
repeatedly affirms that all of Scripture is profitable for us (2 Tim:
3.16) and that all of it is "God-breathed
Thus
is completely pure
(Ps. 12.6) , perfect (Ps. 119.96), and true (Prov: 30.5).
The Bible
itself does not make any restriction on the kinds of subjects to
which it speaks truthfully:
The New Testament contains further affirmations of the reliability
of all parts of Scripture: in Acts 24.14,
Paul says that he worships
God;
"believing everything laid down by the law or written in the
prophets_
In Luke 24.25, Jesus says that the disciples are
foolish
men
because
are "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets
have spoken:
In Romans 15.4,
Paul says that
whatever was
written'
in the Old Testament was
written for our instruction:
These texts give no indication that there is any part of Scripture that
is not t0 be trusted or relied on completely. Similarly; in
Corinthians 10.11, Paul can refer even t0 minor historical details in
the Old Testament (sitting down to eat and drink; rising up
dance) and can say both that they "happened" (thus
implying
historical reliability) and
were written down for Our instruction:
If we begin
examine the way in which the New Testament
authors trust the smallest historical details of the Old Testament
narrative
we see n0 intention t0 separate OUL
matters of "faith and
practice_
or t0 say that this is somehow
recognizable category of
affirmations
Or t0
imply that statements not in that category need
not be trusted Or
thought to be inerrant: Rather;
seems that the
New Testament authors are willing to cite and affirm as true every
detail of the Old Testament
In the
following list are some examples of these historical details
cited by New Testament authors. If all of these are matters of "faith
and practice
then every historical detail of the Old Testament is a
matter of "faith and practice,
and this objection ceases to be an
objection t0 inerrancy. On the other hand, if s0 many details can be
affirmed_
then
seems that all of the historical details in the Old
they
they
Testament can be affirmed as true; and we should not speak of
restricting the necessary truthfulness of Scripture tO some category
of "faith and practice
that would exclude certain minor details_
There are no types of details left that could not be affirmed as true
The New Testament gives us the following data: David ate the
bread of the Presence (Matt. 1233-4); Jonah was in the whale (Matt:
12.40); the men of Nineveh repented (Matt: 12.41); the queen of the
South came
hear Solomon (Matt: 12.42); Elijah was sent
the
widow of Zarephath (Luke 4.25-26); Naaman the Syrian was
cleansed of leprosy (Luke 4.27); on the
Lor left Sodom fire and
brimstone rained from heaven (Luke 17.29; cf: v 32 with its
reference [0 Lot'$
who turned t0 salt); Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness (John 3.14); Jacob gave
field to Joseph
(John 4.5); many details of the history of [srael
occuned (Acts
13.17-23); Abraham believed and received the promise before he
was circumcised (Rom. 4:10); Abraham was about one hundred
years old (Rom: 4.19); God told Rebekah before her children were
born that the elder child would serve the younger (Rom. 9.10-12);
Elijah spoke
God (Rom: 11.2-4); the people of Israel passed
through the sea_
ate and drank spiritual food and drink; desired evil,
sat down t0 drink; rose Up tO dance, indulged in immorality,
grumbled, and were destroyed (1 Cor: 10.11); Abraham gave
tenth of everything
Melchizedek (Heb: 7:1-2); the Old Testament
tabernacle had
specific and detailed design (Heb. 9.1-5); Moses
sprinkled the people and the tabernacle vessels with blood and
water; using scarlet wool and hyssop (Heb. 9.19-21); the world was
created by the Word of God (Heb: 11.3);
many details of the lives
of Abel, Enoch_
Noah, Abraham; Moses
Rahab, and others actually
happened (Heb_
11, passim); Esau sold his birthright for
single
meal and later
sought it back with tears (Heb. 12.16-17); Rahab
received the spies and sent them out another way (James 2.25);
eight persons were saved
the ark (1 Peter 3.20; 2 Peter 2.5); God
turned Sodom and Gomorrah t0 ashes but saved Lot (2 Peter 2.6
7); Balaam
donkey spoke (2 Peter 2:16)
This list indicates that the New Testament writers were willing
rely on the truthfulness of any part of the historica)
narratives 0f the
Old Testament No detail was tOo insignificant to be used for the
instruction of New Testament Christians:
There is no indication that
they thought of
certain category of scriptural statements that were
unreliable and untrustworthy (such as "historical and scientific'
day
wife
with
statements a5
opposed
doctrinab
and moral passages). It seems
clear that the Bible itself does not support any restriction on the
kinds of subjects t0 which it speaks with absolute authority and
truth; indeed, many passages in Scripture actually exclude the
validity of this kind of restriction:
A second response to those who limit the necessary truthfulness of
Scripture
matters of "faith and practice
is [0 note that this
position mistakes the major purpose of Scripture for the total
purpose of Scripture. To say that the major purpose of Scripture is
L0 teach Us in matters of "faith and practice
is [0 make
useful and
correct summary of God's purpose in
giving us the Bible_
But as
summary
includes only the most prominent purpose of God in
giving us Scripture_
It is not; however; legitimate t0 use this
summary [0
that
is part of the purpose of Scripture tO tell us
about minor historical details
about some aspects of astronomy
geography; and
torth
SuMdn
cannot properly be used
one
of the
it is
summarizing
To use it this way would
simply show that the summary
not detailed enough to specify the
items in question:
It is better tO say that the whole purpose of Scripture is [O say
everything it does say; On whatever subject Every one of God*s
words in Scripture was deemed by him t0 be important for uS. Thus,
God issues severe warnings [0 anyone who would take away even
one word from what he has said to us (Deut: 4.2; 12.32; Rev:
22.18-19): we cannot add to God' $ words or take from them, for all
are part of his larger purpose in speaking t0 uS-
Everything stated in
Scripture
there because God intended
t0 be there: God does nOr
say anything unintentionally! Thus, this first objection t0 inerrancy
makes
wrong use of
summary and thereby incorrectly attempts
impose artificial limits on the kinds of things about which God
can
speak
[0 uS_
2. The Term Inerrancy Is
Poor Term: People who make this second
objection say that the term inerrancy is tOO precise and that in ordinary usage
denotes
kind of absolute scientific precision that we do not want t0 claim
for Scripture. Furthermore_
those who make this objection note that the term
inerrancy
not used in the Bible itself. Therefore
it is probably an
inappropriate term for 4S t0 insist upon.
The response t0 this objection may be stated as follows:
the
deny
deny
things
first,
scholars who have used the term inerrancy have defined it clearly
for over
hundred years, and they have always allowed for the
"limitations
that attach t0 speech in
ordinary language
In no case
has the term been used t0 denote
kind of absolute scientific
precision by any responsible representative of the inerrancy
position. Therefore those who raise this objection t0 the term are
not
giving careful enough attention tO the way in which it has been
used in theological discussions for more than
century.
Second
MusC
be noted that we often use nonbiblical terms t0
summarize
biblical
teaching: The word Trinity does nOt occur in
Scripture, nor does the word incarnation. Yet both of these terms
very helpful because they allow uS
summarize in one word
true biblical concept;, and
are therefore helpful in enabling uS
tO discuss
biblica
more easily.
should also be noted that no other single word has been proposed
which says as clearly what we want tO affirm when we wish to talk
about totar
truthfulness in
language;
The word inerrancy does this
quite well, and there seems nO reason not
continue
use
for
that purpose.
Finally; in the church today we seem to be unable t0 carry 0n the
discussion around this topic without the use
this term. People
may object t0 this term
they wish, but; like it or not, this is the
term about which the discussion has focused and almost certainly
will continue [0 focus in the next several decades_
When the
International Council on Biblical Inerrancy (ICBI) in 1977 began
ten-year campaign t0 promote and defend the idea of biblical
inerrancy,
became inevitable that this word would be the one
about which discussion would proceed. The "Chicago Statement on
Biblical Inerrancy;
which was drafted and published in 1978 under
ICBL sponsorship (see appendix
defined what most evangelicals
mean by inerrancy; perhaps not perfectly; but quite well, and further
objections t0 such
widely used and well-defined term seem to be
unnecessary and unhelpful for the church:
3. We Have No Inerrant Manuscripts; Therefore, Talk About an Inerrant
Bible Is Misleading: Those who make this objection point tO the fact that
inerrancy has always been claimed for the first 01 original copies of the
biblical documents
Yet none of these survive: we have only copies of copies
of what Moses 0r Paul or Peter wrote_
What is the use, then, of placing so
they
teaching
great importance on
doctrine that applies only to manuscripts that no one
has?
In reply to this objection,
may first be stated that for over 99
percent of the words of the Bible_
we know what the original
manuscript said. Even for many of the verses where there are
textual variants (that is, different words in different ancient copies
of the same verse), the correct decision is often
clear; and
there are really very few places where the textual variant
both
difficult to evaluate and significant
determining the meaning
the small percentage of cases where there is significant uncertainty
about what the original
text said, the general sense of the sentence
is usually quite clear from the context: (One does not have to be
Hebrew or Greek scholar t0 know where these variants are
because
all modern English translations indicate them in marginal notes
with words such as
some ancient manuscripts read
other
ancient authorities add_
This is not t0 say that the study of textual variants is unimportant;
but it is t0 say that the study of textual variants has not left us in
confusion about what the original manuscripts said_
It has rather
brought us extremely close to the content of those original
manuscripts. For mOSt practical
purposes, then, the current
published scholarly texts of the Hebrew Old Testament and Greek
New Testament are the same as the original manuscripts. Thus_
when we say that the original manuscripts were inerrant; we are
also implying that over 99 percent of the words in our present
manuscripts are also inerrant; for they are exact copies of the
originals Furthermore_
we Rnow where the uncertain
readings are
(tor where there are no textual variants we have no reason t0 expect
faulty copying of the original)_
Thus, our present manuscripts are
for most purposes the same as the original manuscripts
and the
doctrine of inerrancy therefore directly concerns Our present
manuscripts as well.
Furthermore
it is extremely important to affirm the inerrancy of the
original documents, for the subsequent copies were made by men
with no claim Or guarantee by God that these copies would be
perfect But the original manuscripts are those t0 which the claims
be God's very words apply. Thus, if we have mistakes in the
copies (as we do); then these are only the mistakes of men. But if
quite
we have mistakes in the original manuscripts _
then we are forced t0
say not only that men made mistakes, but that God himself made
mistake and spoke
falsely: This
cannot do:
The Biblical Writers "Accommodated" Their Messages in Minor
Details to the False Ideas Current in Their
and Affirmed or Taught
Ideas in an Incidental
This objection t0 inerrancy is slightly
different from the one that would restrict the inerrancy of Scripture t0 matters
of faith and practice, but
is related t0 it Those who hold this position argue
that it would have been
difficult for the biblical writers t0 communicate
with the people of their time if
had tried t0 correct all the false historical
and scientific information believed by their contemporaries. Those who hold
this position
not argue that the points where the Bible affirms false
information are numerous,
even that these places
the main points of any
particular section of Scripture. Rather;
would say that when the biblical
writers were attempting t0 make
larger point, they sometimes incidentally
affirmed some falsehood believed by the people of their time.
To this objection t0 inerrancy it can be replied_
first, that God is
Lord of human language who can use human
language to
communicate perfectly without having t0 affirm any false ideas that
may have been held by people
the time of the
Scripture. This objection t0 inerancy essentially denies God $
effective lordship over human language:
Second,
we mUSL
respond that such
accommodation"
by God to
our misunderstandings would imply that God had acted contrary
his character
unlying God" (Num: 23.19; Titus 1.2; Heb_
6.18). It is not helpful to divert attention from this difficulty by
repeated emphasis on the
gracious condescension of God to speak
on our level: Yes
God does condescend [0 speak our
language; the
language of human
But no passage of Scripture teaches that
condescends'
as t0 act contrary t0 his moral character: He is
never said t0 be able t0 condescend s0 as t0 affirm
evem
incidentally
~something that is false. If God were

himself in this way; he would cease to be the
unlying God:
He would cease
be the God the Bible represents
him to be. Such activity would not in any way show God's
greatness_
for God does not manifest his greatness by acting in a
way that contradicts his character: This objection thus at root
misunderstands the purity and unity of God as they affect all of his
words and deeds

Furthermore
such
process of accommodation, if it actually had
occurred, would create
serious moral problem for uS_
We are [0 be
imitators of God $ moral character (Lev: 11.44; Luke 6.36; Eph:
5.1;
Peter 5.1, et al.) Paul says_
since in our new natures we are
becoming more like God (Eph. 4.24),

imitate God $ truthfulness in our speech: However; if the
accommodation theory is correct; then God intentionally made
incidental affirmations of falsehood in order t0 enhance
communication. Therefore, would
not also be right for 4S
intentionally
make incidental affirmations of falsehood whenever
would enhance communication? Yet this would be tantamount t0
saying that
minor falsehood told for
purpose (a

is not wrong
Such
position, contradicted by the Scripture
passages cited above concerning God'$ total truthfulness in speech,
cannot be held to be valid
Inerrancy Overemphasizes the Divine Aspect of Scripture and Neglects
the Human Aspect This more general objection is made by those who claim
that people who advocate inerrancy S0 emphasize the divine aspect of
Scripture that they downplay its human aspect
It is agreed that Scripture has both
human and
divine aspect; and
that we must give adequate attention t0 both: However; those who
make this objection almost invariably go on tO insist that the truly
"human" aspects of Scripture must include the presence of some
errors in Scripture.
We can respond that though the Bible is fully
human
that it was written by human beings using their Own
language, the activity of God in
overseeing the
of Scripture
and
to be also his words means that it is different from
much other human writing in precisely this aspect: it does not
include error: That is exactly the point made even by sinful, greedy;
disobedient Balaam in Numbers 23.19: God's speech through sinful
human beings is different from the ordinary
of men because
"God is not man that he should lie
Moreover; it is simply not true
that all human speech and
contains error; for we make
dozens of statements each day that are completely tnue. For
example: "My name is Wayne Grudem:

There Are Some Clear Errors in the Bible: This final objection_
that
there are clear errors in the Bible; is either stated 0r implied by most of those

inerrancy; and for many of them the conviction that there are some
actual errors in Scripture is
major factor in
persuading them to challenge the
doctrine of inerrancy:
In every case_
the first answer that should be made to this objection
is t0 ask where such errors are. In which specific verse 0r verses do
these errors occur? It is surprising how frequently one finds that
this objection is made by people who have little or no idea where
the specific errors are, but who believe there are errors because
others have told them SO.
In other cases, however; people will mention one Or more specific
passages where, they claim, there is
false statement in Scripture.
In these cases_
is important that we look at the biblical text itself;
and look at it very closely. If we believe that the Bible is indeed
inerrant;
should be eager and certainly not afraid to inspect these
texts in minute detail. In fact, our expectation will be that close
inspection will show there to be no error at all

difficulty may be immediately
apparent from reading the English text:
At that point it is helpful to
consult some commentaries
on the text
Both Augustine (A.D. 354 -
430) and John Calvin (1509-64),
with many more recent
commentalors
have taken time to deal with most of the alleged
problem texts
and to suggest plausible solutions t0 them.
Furthermore some writers have made collections of all the most
difficult texts and have provided suggested answers for them:
There are
few texts where
knowledge of Hebrew or Greek may
be necessary to find
solution; and those who d not have firsthand
access
these languages may have to find answers either from
more technical commentary or by asking someone who does have

reading

passages has shown that there is
no error where one has
been alleged
But while we must allow the possibility of being unable to solve
particular problem;
should also be stated that there are many
evangelical Bible scholars today who will say that they do not
presently know of any problem texts for which there is no
satisfactory solution. It is possible, of course, that some such texts
could be called to their attention in the
but during the past
fifteen years or s0 of controversy over biblical inerrancy; no such
unsolved" text has been brought to their attention
Finally;
historical perspective on this question is helpful. There
are no really
new
problems in Scripture.
The Bible in its entirery
is over
900 years old, and the alleged "problem texts
have been
there all along- Yet throughout the history of the church there has
been
firm belief in the inerrancy of Scripture in the sense in which
it is defined in this chapter: Moreover; for these hundreds of years
highly competent biblical
scholars have read and studied those
problem texts and still have found no difficulty in
inerrancy This should give uS confidence that the solutions tO these
problems are available and that belief in inerrancy is entirely
consistent with
lifetime of detailed attention
the text of
Scripture.
reem
Den;ng Inerral
The problems that come with
denial of biblical inerrancy are not
insignificant; and when we understand the
magnitude of these
problems it gives Us further encouragement not only to affirm
inerrancy but also t0 affirm its importance for the church: Some of
the more serious problems are listed here:
1. If We Deny Inerrancy;
Serious Moral Problem Confronts Us: May
We Imitate God and Intentionally Lie in Small Matters Also? This is
similar t0 the point made in response t0 objection #4, above; but here it
applies not only to those who espouse objection #4 but also more broadly to
all who deny inerrancy- Ephesians 5.1 tells uS t0 be imitators of God_
But
denial of inerrancy that still claims that the words of Scripture are God-
breathed words necessarily implies that God intentionally
falsely
t0 US
in some of the less central affirmations of Scripture. But if this is right for
fact,
fucufe
holding
spoke
God to do, how can it be wrong for us? Such
line of reasoning would, if we
believed it, exert strong pressure on US to
begin to speak untruthfully in
situations where that might seem to help us communicate better; and so forth.
This position would be
slippery
with
ever-increasing negative results
in our Own lives_
If Inerrancy Is Denied, We
to Wonder If We Can Really 'Trust
God in
Anything He
Once we become convinced that God has spoken
falsely tO uS in some minor matters in Scripture; then we realize that God is
capable of speaking falsely to us_
will have
detrimental effect on our
ability t0 take God at his word and trust him completely or
him fully in
the rest of Scripture.
We will begin tO disobey initially those sections of
Scripture that we least wish to
and t0 distrust initially those sections that
we are least inclined t0 trust. But such
procedure
eventually increase; t0
the great detriment of our spiritual lives_
Of course, such
decline in trust and
obedience
Scripture may not necessarily follow in the life of every
individual who denies inerrancy; but this will certainly be the genera)
pattem;
and it will be the pattern exhibited over the course of
generation that is
taught to deny inerrancy:
3. If We Deny Inerrancy; We Essentially Make Our Own Human Minds
Higher Standard of Truth Than God'$ Word Itself: We use our minds tO
pass judgment on some sections of God'$ Word and pronounce them to be in
error: But this is in effect t0 say that we know tuth more certainly and more
accurately than God's Word does (or than God does), at least in these areas_
Such
procedure; making our own minds to be
higher standard of truth than
God's Word, is the root of all intellectual sin:
4. If We Deny Inerrancy; Then We Must Also
That the Bible Is
Wrong Not Only in Minor Details but in Some of Its Doctrines as Well A
denial of inerrancy means that we say that the Bible's teaching about the
nature of Scripture and about the truthfulness and reliability of God $ words is
also false.
These are not minor details but are major doctrinal concerns in
Scripture _
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Why do YOu think the debate about inerrancy has become such
issue in this century? Why do people on both sides of the question think
it t0 be important?
If you thought there were some small errors affirmed by Scripture, how
do you think that would affect the way YOu read Scripture? Would it

Do you know of any Scripture texts that seem tO contain errors? What
are they? Have YOu tried to resolve the difficulties in those texts? If yOu

As Christians g0 through life learning

do you think you will believe the Bible is inerrant? If s0,
will you believe

If you are convinced that the Bible teaches the doctrine of inerrancy; how
do you feel about it? Are yOu
that such

Does belief in inerrancy guarantee sound doctrine and

life? How can Jehovah s Witnesses say that the Bible is inerrant while
they themselves have so many false teachings?

The Four Characteristics of Scripture: (2)
Clarity
Can only Bible scholars understand the Bible rightly?
EAFL
ANATION AND SCRIPTURAL
BASIS
Anyone who has begun t0 read the Bible seriously will realize that
some parts can be understood very easily while other parts seem
puzzling_
very early in the history of the church Peter
reminded his readers that some
of Paul $ epistles were
difficult t0 understand:
So also our' beloved brother Paul wrote t0
You
according
to the wisdom given him; speaking of this as he does
in all his letters. There are some things in them hard to understand,
which the ignorant and unstable twist t0 their own destruction, as
do the other scriptures'
(2 Peter 3.15-16). We must admit
therefore that not all parts of Scripture are able to be understood
easily.
But
would be
mistake to think that most of Scripture or
Scripture
general is difficult tO understand_
In fact; the Old
Testament and New Testament frequently affirm that Scripture is
written in such
way that its
are able to be understood by
ordinary believers. Even in Peter
statement just quoted, the
context is an appeal t0 the
teachings of Paul *s letter; which Peter'$
readers had read and understood (2 Peter 3.15). In fact; Peter
assigns some moral blame to those who twist these passages "tO
their own destruction.
And he does not say that there are
impossible
understand, but only difficult tO understand_

read

passage;
Moses tells the people of Israel:
And these words which
command YOu this day shall be upon your
heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
talk of them when you sit in your house_
and when you walk by the
way; and when you lie down, and when yOu rise_
(Deut: 6.6
All the people of Israel were expected to be able t0 understand the words of
Scripture well enough to be able to "teach them diligently" to their children_
teaching would not have consisted merely of rote memorization devoid
understanding; for the people of Israel
were t0 discuss the words of
Scripture during their activities of sitting in the house or
going t0
bed or getting up in the morning: God expected that all of his people would
know and be able t0 talk about his Word_
with proper application t0 ordinary
situations in life. Similarly, Psalm
rells us that the "blessed man;-
whom all
the righteous in Israel were
emulate_
was one who meditated on God $ law
"day and night" (Ps. 1:2). This daily meditation assumes an ability to
understand Scripture righly on the part of those who meditate.
The character of Scripture
said t0 be such that even the
simple
can understand
rightly and be made wise by it: "The testimony of
the LORD
sure
making wise the simple
(Ps. 19.7). Again we
read, " The
unfolding of your words gives light;
imparts
understanding t0 the simple
(Ps. 119.130). Here the "simple"
person (Heb. peti)
not merely one who lacks intellectual ability;
but one who lacks sound judgment; who is prone to making
mistakes, and who
easily led astray:
God'$
is SO
understandable, s0 clear; that even this kind of person is made wise
This should be
great encouragement t0 all believers: no
believer should think himself or herself too foolish t0 read Scripture
and understand it sufficiently to be made wise by
There is
similar emphasis in the New Testament: Jesus himself;
his teachings, his conversations_
and his disputes, never responds tO
any questions with
hint of blaming the Old Testament Scriptures
for being unclear: Even while speaking t0 first-century people who
were removed from David by 1,000 years
from Moses by about
1,500 years, and from Abraham by about
00O years, Jesus still
assumes that such people are able to read and rightly to understand
the Old Testament Scriptures_
day when
is common for people to tell us how hard it is t0
This
walking
Word
interpret Scripture rightly; we
would do well to remember that not
once in the Gospels do we ever hear Jesus saying anything like this:
"Isee how your
problem arose
the Scriptures are not very clear
on that subject:
Instead, whether he is
speaking t0 scholars or
untrained common people, his responses always assume that the
blame for misunderstanding any teaching of Scripture is nOt to be
placed on the Scriptures themselves, but on those who
misunderstand or fail to accept what
written. Again and
answers questions with statements
"Have YOu nOt read
(Mall:
12.3,5; 19.14; 22.31), "Have YOU nevel
read in the
scriptures
(Matt: 21.42), 0r even, "You are wrong because YOu
know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God" (Matt: 22.29; cf.
Matt_ 9.13; 12.7; 15.3; 21.13; John 3.10; et al.)
Similarly, most of the New Testament epistles are written not to
church leaders but
entire congregations_
Paul writes,
To the
church of God which is at Corinth'
Cor: 1.2), "To the churches
of Galatia
(Gal: 1.2), "To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at
Philippi, with the bishops and deacons" (Phil. 1:1), and s0 forth:
Paul assumes that his hearers will understand what he writes
and
he encourages the sharing of his letters with other churches:
And
when this letter has been read among You, have it read also in the
church 0f the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from
Laodicea
(Col. 4.16; cf: John 20.30-31; 2 Cor: 1.13; Eph
3.4;
Tim_
4.13; James 1:1,22-25;
Peter 1:1; 2.2; 2 Peter 1.19;
John
5.13).
Second Peter 1.20 may be
urged against the view of the clarity of
Scripture explained in this chapter: The verse says,
'no prophecy of
scripture is
matter of one
own interpretation;'
and someone may
claim that this means that ordinary believers are unable t0 interpret
Scripture rightly for themselves. It is unlikely; however; that this
implication should be drawn from 2 Peter 1.20
for the verse is
probably discussing the origin and not the interpretation of
Scripture.
Thus the NIV translates it,
'no prophecy of Scripture
LuMe
about by the prophet'$ own interpretation.
Furthermore,
evem
if the verse were understood as speaking of interpreting
Scripture, it would be saying that the interpretation of Scripture
must be done within the fellowship of believers and not merely as
personal activity: It still would not be implying that authoritative
interpreters are needed to ascertain the true meaning of Scripture
again
Ikc,
but simply that
and
understanding Scripture should not be
carried out entirely in isolation from other Christians_
Lest we think that
understanding the Bible was somehow easier for
first-century Christians than for US, it is important t0 realize that in
many instances the New Testament epistles were written
churches thar had
proportions of Gentile Christians
were
relatively new Christians who had no previous background in
any kind of Christian society; and who had little Or no prior
understanding of the history and culture of Israel. Nevertheless, the
New Testament authors show no hesitancy in
expecting even these
Gentile Christians [0 be able t0 read
translation of the Old
Testament in their Own language and to understand it rightly (cf:
Rom. 4.1-25; 15.4;
Cor: 10.1-11; 2 Tim 316-17; et al.)
The Moral and Spiritual Oualitic, Neededl
Richt Undertanding
The New Testament writers frequently state that the ability t0
understand Scripture rightly is more
morab
and spiritual than
intellectual ability: " The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts
(literally "things'
of the Spirit of God, for
are folly to him,
and he is not able t0 understand them because they are spiritually
discerned" (1 Cor: 2.14; cf. 1.18-3.4;
Cor: 3.14-16; 4.3-4, 6;
Heb. 5.14; James 1.5-6; 2 Peter 3.5; cf:
Mark 411-12; John 7.17;
8.43). Thus, although the New Testament authors affirm that the
Bible in itself is written clearly; they also affirm that it will not be
understood rightly by those who are
unwilling
t0 receive its
teachings. Scripture is able to be understood by all unbelievers who
will read
sincerely
seeking salvation, and by all believers who
will read
while seeking God's help in understanding it This is
because in both cases the Holy Spirit is at work overcoming the
effects of sin; which otherwise will make the truth appear t0 be
foolish
Cor: 2.14; 1.18-25; James 1.5-6,22-25).
Definitio
of the Chrir
ol Stinture
In order t0 summarize this biblical material, we can affirm thar the
Bible is written
such
way that all things necessary for Our
salvation and for our Christian life and growth are very clearly set
forth in Scripture. Although theologians have sometimes defined
the clarity of Scripture more narrowly (by saying; for example, only
that Scripture is clear in teaching the way of salvation), the many
reading
They
large
they
texts cited above apply t0 many different aspects of biblical
teaching and do not seem t0 support any such limitation on the
areas t0 which Scripture can be said t0 speak clearly It seems more
faithful to those biblical texts t0 define the
clarity"' of Scripture as
follows: The clarity of Scripture means that the Bible is written
such
way [hat ILS
teachings
able to be understood by all who
will read
seeking God $ help and being willing t0 follow it: Once
we have stated this; however; we
also recognize that many
people, even God*s people, do in fact misunderstand Scripture:

Uw
reachings (see Matt
15.16; Mark 4.10-13; 6.52; 8.14-21; 9.32; Luke 18.34; John 8.27
10.6) . Although sometimes this was due to the fact that they simply
needed to wait for further events in the history of redemption; and
especially in the life of Christ himself (see John 12.16; 13.7; cf:
John 2.22), there were also times when this was due t0 their own
lack of faith or hardness of heart (Luke 24.25). Furthermore_
there
were times in the early church when Christians did not understand
agree on the teachings of the Old Testament
about the letters
written by the apostles: note the process of growth in
understanding
concerning the implications of Gentile inclusion in the church
(culminating in "much debate" [Acts 15.7] in the Jerusalem
Council of Acts 15), or Peter'
misunderstanding of this issue in
Galatians 2:11-15, or the frequent doctrinal
and ethical issues that
had t0 be corrected by the New [estament epistles
In fact,
throughout the history of the church, doctrinal disagreements have
been many; and progress in resolving doctrinal differences has often
been slow:
order t0 help people t0 avoid making mistakes in interpreting
Scripture, many Bible teachers have developed
principles of
interpretation,
guidelines to encourage growth in the skill of
proper interpretation: The word hermeneutics (from the Greek word
hermeneuo, "to interpret"
is the more technical term for this field
of study: hermeneutics is the study of correct methods of
interpretation (especially interpretation of Scripture).
Another technical term often used in discussions of biblical
interpretation is "exegesis_
term that refers more t0 the actual
MuSt
practice of interpreting Scripture, not to theories and principles
about how it should be done: exegesis is the process of interpreting
text of Scripture. Consequently, when one studies principles of
interpretation_
that is "hermeneutics
but when one applies those
principles and begins actually explaining
biblical text; he or she is
doing
exegesis_
The existence of many
disagreements about the meaning of
Scripture throughout history reminds us that the doctrine of the
clarity of Scripture does not imply or suggest that all believers
agree on all the
of Scripture:
Nevertheless_
it does tell uS
something very important
that the problem always lies not with
Scripture but with ourselves. The situation is in fact similar t0 that
of the authority of Scripture.
Whereas we affirm that the words of
Scripture have all the authority of God himself; we also realize that
many people do not acknowledge that authority or submit
themselves to it. Similarly; we affirm that all the teachings of
Scripture are clear and able to be understood
but we also recognize
that people often (through their own shortcomings) misunderstand
what is clearly written in Scripture_

The doctrine of the clarity of Scripture therefore has
very
important; and ultimately very encouraging; practical implication: It
tells us that where there are areas of doctrinal or ethical
disagreement (for example, over baptism Or predestination 01
church government), there are only two possible causes for these
disagreements:
On the one hand
may be that we are seeking
make affirmations where Scripture itself is silent In such cases
we should be more ready to admit that God has not given uS the
answer t0 OUr quest; and to allow for differences of viewpoint
within the church. (This will often be the case with
practical
questions, such as methods of evangelism or styles of Bible
teaching =
appropriate church size ) (2) On the other hand, it is
possible that
have made mistakes in our interpretation of
Scripture.
This could have happened because the data
used
decide
question of interpretation were inaccurate O1 incomplete.
Or it could be because there is some personal inadequacy on OuI
part, whether it be, for example, personal pride,
greed, or lack of
faith,
selfishness
even failure t0 devote enough time t0
prayerfully reading and studying Scripture.
Will

But in no case are we free tO say that the teaching of the Bible on
any subject is confusing Or incapable of being understood correctly:
In no case should we think that persistent disagreements on some
subject through the history of the church mean that we will be
unable t0 come t0
curecl
conclusion 0n that subject ourselves_
Rather; if
genuine concern about some such subject arises in
lives
we should sincerely ask God 's help and then g0 to Scripture
searching it with all our ability; believing that God will enable US t0
understand rightly:
This truth should give great encouragement t0 all Christians tO read
their Bibles daily and with great eagerness:
We should never
dssuie
for example; that only those who know Greek and Hebrew;
only pastors or Bible scholars,
able to understand the Bible
rightly
~remember that the Old Testament was written in Hebrew
and that many of the Christians t0 whom the New Testament letters
Were
written had no knowledge of Hebrew at all: they had
read
the Old Testament in
Greek translation. Yet the New Testament
authors assume that these people can read
and understand
rightly even without scholarly ability in the original language
Christians must never give up to the scholarly
experts
the task of
interpreting Scripture: they must
every day for
themselves_
Furthermore
even though we admit that there have been many
doctrinal disagreements in the history of the church; we must not
forget that there has been an amazing amount of doctrinal
agreement on the most central truths of Scripture throughout the
history of the church: Indeed
those who have had opportunities for
fellowship with Christians in other
of the world have
discovered the remarkable fact that wherever we find
group of
vital Christians_
almost immediately
vast amount of agreement on
all the central doctrines of the Christian faith becomes apparent:
Why is this true
no matter what the society; Or culture,
denominational affiliation? It is because they all have been
and
believing
the same Bible
and its primary teachings have been
clear:

Is there any role then for Bible scholars or for those with
specialized knowledge of Hebrew (for the Old Testament) and
keep
doing=
parts
reading
Greek (for the New Testament)? Certainly there is
role for them in
least four areas:
They can teach Scripture clearly;
communicating its content t0
others and thus
fulfilling the office of "teacher" mentioned in the
New Testament (1 Cor: 12.28; Eph: 411).
explore new areas of
understanding the -
Scripture.
This exploration will seldom (if ever) involve denial of
the main
teachings the church has held throughout its centuries, but
it will often involve the application of Scripture tO new areas of life,
the answering of difficult questions that have been raised by both
believers and unbelievers at each new period in
history; and the
continual activity of refining and making more precise the church'$
understanding of detailed points of interpretation of individual
verses Or matters of doctrine or ethics. Though the Bible may not
seem
in comparison with the vast amount of literature in the
world_
it is
rich treasure-house of wisdom from God thar
surpasses in value all the other books that have ever been written_
The process of relating
various [eachings
uE
another;
synthesizing them, and applying them t0 each new generation, is
greatly rewarding task that will never be completed in this age.
Every scholar who deeply loves God*s Word will soon realize that
there
much more in Scripture than can be learned in any one
lifetime_
defend the teachings of the Bible against attacks by
other scholars or those with specialized technical training: The role
teaching God's Word also at times involves
correcting false
teachings. One must be able not only "tO give instruction in sound
doctrine"
but also "to confute those who contradict it" (Titus 1.9;
cf: 2 Tim: 2.25_
correcting his opponents with gentleness"
and
Titus 2.7-8). Sometimes those who attack biblical
have
specialized training and technical knowledge in historical,
linguistic
philosophical study; and they use that training t0
mount rather sophisticated attacks against the
of Scripture_
In such cases
believers with similar specialized skills can use their
training
understand and respond to such attacks. Such training
also very useful in responding
the false teachings of cults and
sects_
This
not to say that believers without specialized
are incapable of
responding to false
(for most false
teaching can be clearly refuted by
believer who prays and has

good knowledge of the English Bible), but rather that technical
points in arguments can only be answered by those with skills in the
technical areas appealed to.
They can supplement the study of Scripture for the benefit of the
church: Bible scholars often have training that will enable them to
relate the teachings of Scripture to the rich history of the church;
and to make the interpretation of Scripture more precise and its
meaning more vivid with
greater knowledge of the languages and
cultures in which the Bible was written_
These four functions benefit the church as
whole, and all believers
should be thankful for those who perform them. However; these
functions do not include the right to decide for the church as
whole what is true and false doctrine or what is proper conduct in a
difficult situation_
If such
right were the preserve of formally
trained Bible scholars
then they would become
governing elite in
the church; and the ordinary
functioning of the government of the
church as described in the New Testament would cease
The
process of decision-making fOr the church must be left tO the
officers of the church, whether they are scholars 0r not (and_
in a
congregational form of church government, not only tO the officers
but also
the people of the church as
whole)
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
If the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture
true, why does there seem to
be so much
disagreement among Christians about the teaching of the
Bible? Observing the diversity of interpretations of Scripture, some
conclude; "People can make the Bible say
anything they want
How do
you think Jesus would respond t0 this statement?
What would happen t0 the church
most believers gave up reading the
Bible for themselves and only listened t0
Bible teachers 0r read books
about the Bible? If you thought that only expert scholars could
understand the Bible rightly; what would happen to your personal
of Scripture? Has this already happened to some extent in your
life Or in the lives of those you know?
Do you think that there are right and wrong interprerations of most or all
passages
Scripture? If yOu thought the Bible was generally unclear;
how would your answer change? Will
conviction about the clarity of
Scripture affect the care YOu use when
studying
text of Scripture? Will
it affect the way YOu approach Scripture when trying
gain
biblical
reading
answer [0 some difficult doctrinal 0r moral
problem?
If even seminary professors disagree about some Bible teaching_
can
other Christians ever hope t0 come to
correct decision on that
teaching? (Give reasons for your answer: ) Do YOu think ordinary people
among the Jews at the time of Jesus had
hard time
deciding whether
believe Jesus or the scholarly experts who disagreed with him? Did Jesus
expect them to be able to decide?
How can
pastor preach biblically based sermons each Sunday without
giving the impression that only people with seminary training (like
himself) are able t0 interpret Scripture rightly? Do
think it should
ever be necessary; in
doctrinal or ethica)
controversy; for
Bible
scholar to speak in
church and base his main arguments on special
meanings of Greek or Hebrew words that the church members
themselves are unable to evaluate or take issue with personally? Is there
appropriate way for
scholar t0 use such technical knowledge in
popular writing 0r speaking?
Church leaders at the time of Martin Luther said they wanted to keep the
Bible in Latin t0 prevent the common people from reading it and then
misinterpreting it Evaluate this argument Why do you think Martin
Luther was SO anxious
translate the Bible into German? Why do you
think church leaders
previous centuries have persecuted and even
killed men
like William Tyndale in England
who were transE
the
Bible into the language of the people? Why is the task of Bible
translation into other languages S0 important
part of the work of
missions?
Does the doctrine of the clarity of Scripture mean that the New
Testament can be fully understood by people who do not have access
an Old Testament?

"Jehovah's Perfect Law
This section of Psalm 19 set t0 music reminds US of many excellent
qualities of Scripture; among them the fact that it is written clearly:
"The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple" (v 7).
(Use the tune of "We Come
Christ; to You:
Jehovah '$ perfect law restores the soul
His testimony sure gives wisdom unto men;
The precepts of the LORD are right;
And fill the heart with

The LORD

Jehovah '$ fear is clean, enduring evermore;
His statutes; let the world confess
Are wholly truth and righteousness.

In keeping them is great reward.

The Four Characteristics of Scripture:
Necessity
For what purposes are the Bible necessary? How much can people
know about God without the Bible?
Do we need t0 have
Bible 0r t0 have someone tell us what the
Bible says in order t0 know that God exists? Or that we are sinners
needing to be saved? Or to know how to find salvation? Or to know
God'$ will for our lives? These are the kinds of questions which an
investigation of the necessity of Scripture is intended t0 answer:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The necessity of Scripture may be defined as follows: The necessity
of Scripture means that the Bible is necessary for knowing the
gospel, for maintaining spiritual life
and for knowing God $ will,
but is not necessary for knowing that God exists or for knowing
something about God $ character and moral laws.
That definition may now be explained in its various parts_
The Bihle
Nerrur
Knonaledce ol the G oxpcl
In Romans 10.13-17 Paul says:
For; "everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.
But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed?
And how are they t0 believe in him of whom they have never heard?
And how are
to hear without_
preacher?
So faith comes from
what
heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ:
This statement indicates the following line of reasoning: (1) It first
assumes that one must call upon the name of the Lord to be saved:
(In Pauline usage generally as well as in this specific context [see
they
9], "the Lord" refers to the Lord Jesus Christ:)
People can only
call upon the name of Christ if they believe in him (that is_
that he is
Savior worthy of calling upon and one who will answer those who
call): (3) People cannot believe in Christ unless
have heard of
him: (4) They cannot hear of Christ unless there is someone to tell
them about Christ (a "preacher"
[he conclusion is that saving
faith comes by hearing (that is, by hearing the gospel message), and
this
of the gospel message comes about through the
preaching of Christ. The implication seems t0 be that without
hearing the preaching of the gospel of Christ, no one can be saved.
This passage is one of several
that show that eternal salvation
comes only through belief in Jesus Christ and no other way:
Speaking of Christ, John 3.18 says_
"He who believes in him is nOr
condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already;
because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God:
Similarly; in John 14.6 Jesus says_
~Tam the way; and the truth; and
the life; no one comes t0 the
Father; but by me:
Peter; on trial before the Sanhedrin, says,
"[here is salvation in no
one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men
by which we must be saved" (Acts 4.12). Of course_
the
exclusiveness of salvation through Christ is because Jesus is the
only one who ever died for our sins 0r whoever could have done SO_
Paul says_
"For there is one God, and there
one mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus
who gave himself as
ransom
for all
Tim 2.5-6). There is no other way t0 be reconciled
to God than through Christ; for there is no other way of
with the guilt of our sin before
holy God_
But if people can be saved only through faith in Christ; someone
might ask how believers under the old covenant could have been
saved: The answer must be that those who were saved under the old
covenant were also saved through trusting in Christ, even though
their faith was
forward-looking faith based on God*s word of
promise that
Messiah or
Redeemer would come_
Speaking of
Old Testament believers such as Abel, Enoch; Noah; Abraham; and
Sarah; the author of Hebrews says,
These all died in faith
noc
having received what was promised, but having seen it and greeted
it from afar
(Heb. 11.13). The same chapter goes on
say that
Moses
considered abuse suffered for the Christ (or the Messiah)
they
hearing
dealing
greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked t0 the
reward" (Heb: 11:26). And Jesus can say of Abraham;
Your father
Abraham rejoiced that he was tO see my day; he saw it and was
glad" (John 8.56). This again apparently refers to Abraham'$ joy in
looking forward to the day of the promised Messiah.
Thus
even
Old Testament believers had saving faith in Christ; t0 whom
looked forward, not with exact knowledge of the historical details
of Christ's life _
but with great faith in the absolute reliability of
God'$ word of promise
The Bible
necessary for salvation; then_
in this sense: one muSt
either read the gospel message in the Bible for oneself, or hear it
from another person:
Even those believers who came t0 salvation in
the old covenant did so by trusting in the words of God that
promised
Savior [0 come:
In fact; these repeated instances of people trusting in God's words
of promise, together with the verses above that affirm the necessity
of hearing about and
believing
in Christ, seem t0 indicate that sinful
people need more 0n which to rest their faith than just an intuitive
guess that God might provide
means ot salvation
It seems that
the only foundation firm enough t0 rest one'$ faith On is the word of
God itself (whether spoken or written). This in the earliest times
came in
brief form, but from the very beginning we have
evidence of words of God promising
salvation yet [0 come_
words
that were trusted by those people whom God called to himself:
For example, even in the lifetime of Adam and Eve there are some
words of God that point toward
future salvation: in Genesis 3.15
the curse on the serpent includes
promise that the seed of the
woman (one of her descendants) would bruise the head of the
serpent but would himself be hurt in the process
promise
ultimately fulfilled in Christ: The fact that the first two children of
Adam and
Cain and Abel; offered sacrifices t0 the LORD (Gen_
4.33
indicates their consciousness of _
need t0 make some kind of
payment for the
of their sin, and of God's promise of
acceptance of sacrifices offered in the right way. Genesis 4.7_
You do well, will You not be
accepted?" indicates again in the
briefest form
word from God that offered the provision of some
kind of salvation through trusting in the promise of God offered in
that word.
As the history of the Old Testament progressed
God's
words of promise became more and more specific; and the forward-
they
very
Eve
guilt,
very
faith of God's people accordingly became more and more
definite. Yet it seems always t0 have been
faith resting
specifically on the words of God himself:
Thus, although it will be argued below that people can know that
God exists and can know something of his laws apart from
Scripture, it seems that there is no
possibility of coming
saving
faith apart from specific knowledge of God*s words of promise

Jesus says in Matthew 4.4 (quoting Deut 8.3),
Man shall not live
on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of
God" (NASB)
Here Jesus indicates that our spiritual life is
maintained by daily nourishment with the Word of God, just as Our
physical lives are maintained by daily nourishment with physical
food:
To neglect
regular reading of God's Word is as detrimental to
the health of our souls as the neglect of physica)
food is detrimental
the health of our bodies.
Similarly, Moses tells the people of Israel of the importance of
God's words for their lives: "For it is no trifle for you; but it isyour
life , and thereby yOu shall live
in the land which You are going
ovei
the Jordan t0 possess'
(Deut: 32.47).
And Peter encourages the
Christians [O whom he writes, "Like newborn babes, long for the
pure spiritual milk, that by it YOu may grow Up tO salvation'
Peter 2.2). The
pure spiritual milk'
this context must refer t0 the
Word of God abour which Peter has been
speaking (see
Peter
1.23-25). The Bible, then, is necessary for maintaining spiritual life
and for growth in the Christian life:
The Bible Is Necessary for Certain Knowledge of God's Will
will be argued below that all people
ever
bom have some
knowledge of God*s will through their consciences_
Buc this
knowledge is often indistinct and cannot give certainty: In
there were no
written Word of God_
we could not gain certainty
about God's will through other means such as conscience, advice
from others;
an intema
witness of the Holy Spirit, changed
circumstances
and the use of sanctified reasoning and common
sense
These all might give an approximation of God's will
muIE
less reliable ways, but from these means alone no certainty about
God's will could ever be attained, at least in
fallen world where
looking
long
facl,
sin distorts OUI perception of right and wrong
faulty
reasoning into our
thinking processes, and causes 4S
suppress
from time t0 time the testimony of our consciences (cf. Jer: 17.9
Rom 2.14-15;
Cor: 8.10; Heb_
5.14; 10.22; also
Tim: 4.2; Titus
1:15).
In the Bible; however; we have clear and definite statements about
God's will. God has nOr revealed all
to vS_
but he has
revealed enough for S
know his
"The secret things belong
the LORD our God; but the things that
revealed belong to us
and t0 our children for ever; that we may do all the words of this
law" (Deut. 29.29).
As it was in the time of Moses; SO it is nOw
with us: God has revealed his words t0 US that we might obey his
laws and thereby do his will: To be "blameless
in God $ sight is to
walk in the law of the LORD'
(Ps. 119.1). The "blessed" man is
one who does not follow the will of wicked people (Ps. 1:1), but
delights
in the law of the LORD,
and meditates on God s law
and night" (Ps. 1:2). To love God (and thereby t0 act in a way that
pleasing to him) is to
his commandments
(1 John 5.3). If
we are t0 have
certain knowledge of God's will, then,
must
attain
through the study of Scripture.
in one sense
can be
argued that the Bible is necessary for
certain knowledge about anything
philosopher might argue as
follows: The fact that we do not know everything requires US to be
uncertain abour
everything
do claim t0 know. This is because
SUME
fact unknown
uS may yet turn out t0 prove that what we
thought to be true was actually false. For example
think we
know our date of birth, our name_
our age, and s0 forth_
But we
must admit that it is possible that some day we could find that our
parents had given uS false information and OuI
certain" knowledge
would then turn out to be incorrect. Regarding events that we
personally have experienced, we all realize how it is possible for uS
remember" words or events incorrectly and find ourselves later
corrected by more accurate information: We can usually be more
certain about the events of 0ur present
experience_
as iL
remains present (but even
someone might argue, could be
dream, and we
only discover this fact when we wake up') At
any rate_
it is difficult t0 answer the
philosopher"
question: If we
do not know all the facts in the universe,
past, present; and future;
how can we
attain certainty that we have correct information
aboutany one fact?

that;

Ultimately; there are only two possible solutions tO this problem:
We must learn all the facts of the universe in order t0 be sure
that no subsequently discovered fact will prove Our present ideas t0
be false; or (2
someone who does know all the facts in the
universe, and who never lies, could tell uS some true facts that we
can then be sure will never be contradicted
This second solution is in fact what we have when we have God $
words in Scripture. God knows all facts that ever have been or
evei
will be
And this God who is omniscient (all-knowing) has
absolutely certain knowledge: there can never be any fact that he
does not already know; thus_
there can never be any fact that would
prove that something God thinks is actually false_
Now it is from
this infinite storehouse of certain knowledge that God_
who never
lies_
has spoken t0 US in Scripture; in which he has told us many
true things about himself, about ourselves, and about the universe
that he has made: No fact can
ever [um up
contradict the truth
spoken by this one who is omniscient:
Thus, it is appropriate for uS to be more certain about the truths we
read in Scripture than about any other knowledge
have: If we
are [0 talk about
degrees of certainty of knowledge we have_
then
the
knowledge -
attain from Scripture would have the highest
degree of certainty: if the word
certain" can be applied to any kind
of human knowledge;
can be applied to this knowledge
This concept of the certainty of knowledge that we attain from
Scripture then gives US
reasonable basis for affirming the
correctness of much of the other knowledge that we have
We read
Scripture and find that its view of the
around uS, of human
nature, and of ourselves corresponds closely to the information we
have gained from OUI own sense-experiences of the world around
Thus we are
encouraged to trust our sense-experiences of the
world around uS:
observations correspond with the absolute
truth of Scripture; therefore, our observations are also true and, by
and
large, reliable
Such confidence in the general reliability of
observations made with Our eyes and ears is further confirmed by
the fact that it is God who has made these faculties and who in
Scripture frequently encourages uS tO use them (compare also Prov:
20.12: "The
and the seeing eye; the LORD has made
them both"

OL"
hearing
In this way the Christian who takes the Bible as God's Word
escapes from philosophical skepticism about the possibility of
attaining certain knowledge with our finite minds. In this sense,
then; it is correct t0 say that for people who are not omniscient; the
Bible is necessary for certain knowledge about anything
This fact is important for the following discussion, where we affirm
that unbelievers can know something about God from the general
revelation that
seen
the world around them. Although this is
true;
must recognize that in a fallen world knowledge gained by
observation of the world is always imperfect and always liable to
error 0i
misinterpretation: Therefore the knowledge of God and
creation gained from Scripture must be used to interpret correctly
the creation around us. Using the theological terms that we will
define below; we can say that we need
special revelation to interpret
general revelation rightly:
D: But the Bible Is Not Necessary for
Knowing That God Exists
What about people who do not read the Bible? Can
obtain any
knowledge of God? Can
Know
anything about his laws? Yes
without the Bible some
knowledge of God
possible, even if it is
not absolutely certain
knowledge.
People can obtain
knowledge that God exists , and
knowledge of
some of his attributes, simply from observation of themselves and
the
around them. David says, "The heavens are telling the
glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork" (Ps_
19.1). To look at the sky
IO see
evidence of the infinite power;
wisdom; and even beauty of God; it is t0 observe
majestic witness
the glory of God. Similarly; Barnabas and Paul tell the Greek
inhabitants of Lystra about the
God who made the heavens
and the earth: "In past
generations he allowed all the nations t0
walk in their Own ways; yet he did not leave himself without
witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and
fruitful seasons
satisfying your hearts with food and gladness'
(Acts 14.16-17). Rains and fruitful seasons
food produced from
the earth; and gladness in people's hearts, all bear witness to the
fact that their Creator is
God of mercy; of love, and even of joy:
These evidences of God are all around us in creation tO be seen by
those who are
willing
see them
they
they
world
living
Even those who by their wickedness suppress the truth cannot avoid
the evidences of God' $ existence and nature in the created order:
For what can be known about God is plain [0 them, because God has
shown it t0 them:
Ever since the creation of the world his invisible
nature
namely; his eternal power and deity; has been clearly
perceived
the things that have been made:
So they are withour
excuse; for although they knew God
did nor honor him as God or
give thanks to him; but they became futile in their thinking and their
senseless minds were darkened_
(Rom: 1.19-21)
Here Paul says not only that creation gives evidence of God $
existence and character; but also that even wicked men recognize
that evidence:
What can be known about God is "plain t0 them" and
in fact
knew God" (apparently;
knew who he was), but
"they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him
This
passage allows uS t0 say that all persons, even the most wicked,
have some internal knowledge or perception that God exists and
that he is
powerful Creator: This knowledge is seen "in the
that have been made;
phrase that refers
all creation. Yet it is
probably
seeing mankind created in the image
God
-that is, in
seeing both themselves and other people
that even wicked persons
the greatest evidence of God $ existence and nature_
Thus,
even
without the Bible, all persons who have ever lived have
had evidence in creation that God exists_
that he is the Creator and
they are creatures_
and have also had some evidence of his
character: As
result; they themselves have known something
about God from this evidence (even though this is never said to be
knowledge that is able to bring them to salvation)

Sunething About God < Character and Moral Laws

(Rom. 1.32). Wicked people know that
their sin is wrong; at least in large measure
they

Paul then talks about the activity of conscience in Gentiles who do
not have the written law:
When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law
requires, they are
law to themselves, even though
do not have
the law: They show that what the law requires is written on their
hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting
thoughts accuse Or perhaps excuse them:
(Rom: 2.14-15)
The consciences of unbelievers bear witness t0 God $ moral
standards, but at times this evidence of God's law on the hearts of
unbelievers is distorted or
suppressed
Sometimes their thoughts
accuse'
them and sometimes their thoughts
excuse
them; Paul
says.
The knowledge of God's laws derived from such sources is
never perfect; but
is enough to give an awareness of God'$ moral
demands
all mankind. (And it is on this basis that Paul argues
that all humanity is held guilty before God for sin, even those who
do not have the written laws of God in Scripture.
The knowledge of God's existence, character; and moral law; which
comes through creation t0 all humanity; is often called "general
revelation" (because
comes to all people generally).
General
lation comes through observing nature, through seeing God s
directing influence in history; and through an inner sense of God*s
existence and his laws that he has placed inside every person.
General revelation is distinct from
special revelation;

such as the
words of the Bible, the words of the Old Testament prophets and
New Testament apostles_
and the words ot God spoken

such as ar Mount Sinai 0r
the baptism of Jesus_
Special revelation includes all the words of Scripture but is not
limited t0 the words of Scripture
tor it also includes_
for example;
many words of Jesus that were not recorded in Scripture; and
probably there were many words spoken by Old Testament
prophets and New Testament apostles that were not recorded in
Scripture either:

from their consciences. Because there is some common knowledge
of right and wrong, Christians can often find much consensus with
non-Christians in matters of civil law, community standards, basic
ethics for business and professional activity, and acceptable patterns
of conduct in ordinary life_
Moreover;
Ke Cal
appeal
to the sense of
rightness within people s hearts (Rom: 2:14) when attempting t0

or' t0
right some other
injustices in society around us_
The knowledge of God's existence
and character also provides
basis of information that enables the
gospel to make sense to
non-Christian s heart and mind:
unbelievers know that God exists and that
have broken his
standards, so the news that Christ died to pay for their sins should
truly come as
news [0
them:
However; it must be emphasized that Scripture nowhere indicates
that people can know the gospel, or know the way of salvation,
through such general revelation. They may know that God exists,
that he is their Creator, that
Owe
him obedience, and that they
have sinned
him.
The existence of systems of sacrifice in
primitive religions throughout history attests tO the fact that these
things can be clearly known by people apart from the Bible: The
repeated occurrences of the "rain and fruitful seasons'
mentioned in
Acts 14.17 may even lead some people t0 reason that God is not
only holy and righteous but also loving and forgiving:
But how the
holiness and justice of God can ever be reconciled with his
willingness
forgive sins is
mystery that has never been solved
by any religion apart from the Bible. Nor does the Bible give us any
hope that it ever can be discovered apart from specific revelation
from God. It is the great wonder of our redemption that God
himself has provided the way of salvation by
his own Son
who
both God and man, t0 be our representative and bear the
penalty for our sins
thus
combining the justice and love of God in
one infinitely wise and amazingly
act. This
which
seems
commonplace t0 the Christian ear; should not lose its wonder
for US:
could never have been conceived by man alone apart from
God's special, verbal revelation
Furthermore, even if an adherent of
primitive religion could think
that God somehow must have himself paid the penalty for our sins_
such
thought would only be an extraordinary speculation.

with his own words, namely; the words of the gospel proclaiming
either that this indeed was going t0 happen (if the revelation came

human speculation apart from the Word of God as
sufficient basis
on which t0 rest
saving faith: such saving faith, according t0
Scripture, is always confidence 0r trust in God that rests on the
truthfulness of God'
own words.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
When you are
witnessing
IO 9n
unbeliever; what is the one
above
all others that you should want him or her t0 read? Do you know of
anyone who ever became
Christian without either reading the Bible or
hearing someone tell him or her what the Bible said? What then is the
primary task of an evangelistic missionary? How should the necessity of
Scripture affect our missionary orientation?
Do you nourish your soul on the spiritual food of the Word as carefully
and diligently as yOu nourish your body on physical food? What makes
us so spiritually insensitive that we feel physical hunger much more
acutely than spiritual hunger? What is the remedy?
When we are actively
tO know God $ will; where should we
spend most of our time and effort? In practice_
where do You spend most

sociery
ever seem
conflict? How should we seek t0 resolve the conflict?
Is it a hopeless task t0 work for civil legislation based on standards that
accord with God'$ moral principles in Scripture? Why is there good
reason t0 hope that we will finally be able to persuade
great majority of

"Teach Me;

An alternative hymn for this chapter is
modem
Scripture song;
"Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God:
The second verse of this song
("Man shall not live on bread alone_
) is
quotation of Matthew
4.4 and expresses the necessity of Scripture for
maintaining
spiritual life: we live on every word that proceeds from the mouth
of God: The other verses of the song do not speak directly of the
obey,

doctrine of the necessity of Scripture but do contain the words of
gospel invitation (vv: 1, 4,5). All verses in the
are direct
quotations of Scripture; and, as such;
be spiritually nourishing
for uS to sing and meditate on.

The Four Characteristics of Scripture: (4)
Sufficiency
Is the Bible enough for knowing what God wants US t0 think or
do?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Are we t0 look for other words from God in addition t0 those we
have in Scripture? The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture
addresses this question:
Huetniin n
huflcienc
OleaTituT
We can define the
sufficiency of Scripture as follows: The
sufficiency of Scripture means that Scripture contained all the
words of God he intended his people to have at each stage of
redemptive history, and that it now contains everything we need
God [0 tell us for salvation, for trusting him perfectly, and for
obeying him perfectly:
This definition emphasizes that it is in Scripture alone that we are
search for God $ words t0 us. It also reminds us that God considers
what he has told us in the Bible to be enough for uS_
and that we
should rejoice in the
revelation that he has given 4S and be
content with ic
Significant scriptural support and explanation of this doctrine is
found in Paul $ words to Timothy;
childhood you have been
acquainted with the sacred writings which are able tO instruct YOu
for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus"
Tim. 3.15). The
context shows that
sacred writings'
here means the written words
of Scripture (2 Tim. 3.16). This is an indication that the words of
God which we have in Scripture are all the words of God we need
in order t0 be saved: these words are able t0 make US wise "for
great
from
salvation. -
This is confirmed by other passages that talk about the
words of Scripture as the means God uses to bring us t0 salvation
(James 1:18;
Peter 1.23)
Other passages indicate that the Bible is sufficient to equip us for
living the Christian life_
Once again Paul writes t0 Timothy;
AlL
scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof;
for correction; and for training in righteousness
that the man of
God may be complete; equipped for every good work
Lim:
3.16-17).
Here Paul indicates that one purpose for which God caused
Scripture
be written is tO train uS that we might be
equipped for
every
wOrk:
there is any
good
that God wants
Christian [0 do_
this passage indicates that God has made provision
in his Word for
training the Christian in it. Thus_
there is no "good
that God wants uS to do other than those that are taught
somewhere in Scripture:
can equip uS tor every
good work
A similar
is found in Psalm 119:
Blessed are those whose
way is blameless who walk in the law of the LORD! -
1). This
verse shows an
equivalence between being "blameless
and
walking in the law of the LORD
those who are blameless are
those who walk in the law of the Lord
Here again is an indication
that all that God requires of uS is recorded in his written Word:
simply to do all that the Bible commands us is t0 be blameless in
God's sight:
To be morally perfect in God s sight, then, what must we do in
addition to what God commands us in Scripture?
at all! If we simply keep the words of Scripture
will be
"blameless
and we will be doing "every good
that God
expects of uS

Of course, We realize that
will nevel
perfectly obey all of
Scripture in this life (see James 3.2;
John 1.8-10; and chapter 24
below) Thus
it may not at first seem very significant to say that all
we have [0 do
what God commands US in the Bible, since we will
never be able t0
it all in this life anyway. But the truth of the
sufficiency of Scripture is of great significance for our Christian

enables uS t0 focus OuI search for God $ words t0 US 0n
the Bible alone and saves Us from the endless task of searching
through all the writings of Christians throughout history; Or through
all the
of the church, or through all the subjective feelings
and impressions that come to Our minds from day t0 day,
in order
to find what God requires of us_
very practical sense; it means
that we are able t0 come to clear conclusions on many
Scripture.
For example, though it requires some work; it is possible
find all the biblical passages that are directly relevant t0 the
matters of marriage and divorce_
or the responsibilities of parents t0
children_
the relationship between
Christian and civil
government:
This doctrine means, moreover; that it is possible t0 collect all the
passages that directly relate t0 doctrinal issues such as the
atonement; or the
person of Christ, Or the work of the
Spirit in
the believer's life today: In these and hundreds of other moral
and
doctrinal questions, the biblical teaching about the sufficiency of
Scripture gives us confidence that we
be able t0 find what God
requires US
think or [0 do
these areas_
many of these areas
we can attain confidence that we,
together with the vast majority of
the church throughout history; have found and correctly formulated
what God wants uS to think O t0 do. Simply stated, the doctrine of
the sufficiency of Scripture tells US that it is possible t0 study
systematic
and ethics and find answers tO our questions
At this point we differ from Roman Catholic theologians, who
would say that we have not found all that God says t0 us about any
particular subject until we have also listened t0 the official
teaching
of the church throughout its history: We would respond that
although the history of the church may help us
understand what
God says t0 us in the Bible; never in church history has God added
t0 the teachings Or commands of Scripture: Nowhere in church
history outside of Scripture has God added anything that he
requires US to believe or to do. Scripture
sufficient to equip us for
every good work;
and to walk in its ways is to be "blameless
God'$ sight:
At this point we also differ from nonevangelical theologians who
are not convinced that the Bible is God's Word in any unique 0r
absolutely authoritative sense, and Who would therefore search nOt
only the Bible but also many other early Christian writings
reachings
reachings
Holy
will
theology
attempt to find not s0 much what God said to mankind but rather
what many early Christians experienced in their relationship
God: They would not expect t0 arrive at
single, unified conclusion
about what God wants US [0 think or do with
regard to any
particular question, but to discover
variety of opinions and
viewpoints collected around some major unifying ideas. All of the
viewpoints held by early Christians in any of the early churches
would then be potentially valid viewpoints for Christians to hold
today as well. To this we would reply that Our search for answers t0
theological and ethical questions is not .-
search t0 find what
various believers have thought in the history of the church; but is
quest to find and understand what God himself says t0 us in his
own words_
which are found in Scripture and only in Scripture.
The Amount of Scripture Given Was Sufficient at Each
Stage of
Redemptive History
The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture does not imply that God
canno
add any more words t0 those he has already spoken to his
people:
rather implies that man cannot add on his Own initiative
any words [0 those that God has already spoken
Furthermore; it
implies that in fact God has not spoken to mankind any more words
which he requires Us t0 believe or obey other than those which we
have nOw in the Bible:
This point is important; for it helps US to understand how God could
tell his people that his words to them were sufficient at many
different points in the history of redemption, and how he could
nevertheless add tO those words later: For example; in Deuteronomy
29.29 Moses says,
The secret
things belong to the LORD our God;
but the things that are revealed belong to us and tO our children for
ever; that we may do all the words of this law:-
This verse reminds us that God has always taken the initiative in
revealing things
[0 4S_
He has decided what t0 reveal and what not
reveal:
At each
in redemptive history, the
that God
had revealed were for his people for that time; and they
were t0
study, believe, and
those
With further progress in the
history of redemption; more of God $ words were added, recording
and interpreting that history (see chapter =
above regarding the
development of the canon).
With

things
ohey
things.
Thus, at the time of the death of Moses; the first five books of our
Old Testament were sufficient for God's people at that time. But
God directed later authors t0 add more s0 that Scripture would be
sufficient for believers in subsequent times_
For Christians today;
the words from God that we have in the Old and New Testaments
together are sufficient for US during the church age_
After the death;
resurection; and ascension of Christ, and the
founding of the early
church as recorded in the New Testament; and the
assembling of the
books of the New Testament canon, no further central redemptive
acts of God in history (acts that have direct relevance for all God $
people for all subsequent time) have occurred, and thus no further
words of God have been given t0 record and interpret those acts for
This means that we can cite
Scripture texts from throughout the
canon [0
show that the principle of the sufficiency of God $
lation t0 his people at each particular time has remained the
same_
In this sense
these verses that talk about the sufficiency of
Scripture in earlier periods are directly applicable t0 Us as well,
evem
though the extent of the Bible to which they refer in OuT
situation is greater than the extent of the Scripture
which they
referred in their originaL
The
following
texts from Scripture
thus apply t0 US also in that sense:
You shall not add t0 the word which
command YOu, nor take
that YOU may
the commandments of the LORD vour God which
command you. (Deut: 4.2)
Everything that
command you you shall be careful t0
you shall nor
add to it or take from it (Deut: 12.32)
Every word of God proves true; he is

in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you_
and you be found

everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if
anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this
book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
prophecy; God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city; which are described in this book: (Rev:

The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture has several practical
applications t0 our Christian lives. The following list is intended to
be helpful but not exhaustive
The sufficiency of Scripture should encourage us as we try t0
discover what God would have US t0 think (about
particular
doctrinal
issue) or t0 do (in
particular situation)
We should be
encouraged that everything God wants t0 tell us about that question
is t0 be found in Scripture. This does not mean that the Bible
answers all the questions that we might think up_
The secret
belong to the LORD our God" (Deut: 29.29). But it does mean
that when we are
facing
problem of genuine importance tO OUI
Christian life;
we can
approach Scripture with the confidence that
from it God will provide us with guidance for that problem:
There will of course be some times when the answer we find is that
Scripture does not speak directly
question: (This would be
the case_
for example; if we tried to find from Scripture what
order
of worship
follow on Sunday mornings
whether it is better [0
kneel or
perhaps to stand when we pray; 0r at what time we should
eat OuT meals during the
etc.) In those cases,
we may conclude
that God has not required uS t0 think or to act in any certain way
with
regard to that question (except; perhaps, in terms of more
general principles regarding our attitudes and goals). But in many
other cases we will find direct and clear guidance from the Lord to
equip us for
every good work'
(2 Tim: 3.17)-
As we go through life, frequent practice in searching Scripture for
guidance will result in an
increasing ability
find accurate_
carefully formulated answers t0 our problems and questions_
Lifelong growth in understanding Scripture
thus include
growth
the
of rightly understanding the Bible
reachings
and applying them to specific questions.
The sufficiency of Scripture reminds uS that we are to add
nothing
Scripture, and that we are t0 consider no other
writings
of equal value to Scripture.
This principle
violated by almost all
cults and sects. Mormons, for example, claim to believe the Bible_
but they also claim divine authority for the Book of Mormon:
Christian Scientists similarly claim to believe the Bible
but in
practice
hold the book Science and Health With

things
day;
Will

they
in authority. Since these claims violate God'$ commands not to add
his words, we should not think that any additional words from
God to uS would be found in these writings
Even in Christian
churches
similar error is sometimes made when people go beyond
what Scripture says and assert with great confidence new ideas
about God or heaven, basing their teachings not on Scripture but on
their own
peculation
01 even on claimed
experiences of dying and
coming back to life_
The sufficiency of Scripture also tells us that God does not
require uS t0 believe anything about himself or his redemptive work
that is not found
Scripture. Among
from the time of the
early church are some collections of
alleged sayings of Jesus that
Were
not preserved in the Gospels. It is likely that at least some of
the
sayings of Jesus'
found in these writings are rather accurate
records of things Jesus actually said (though it
now impossible
for uS
determine with any high degree of probability which
sayings those are)_
But it does not really matter at all for our
Christian lives if we never read any of those sayings, for God has
caused to be recorded in Scripture everything that we need t0 know
about Jesus' words and deeds in order t0 trust and
hin
perfectly: Though these collections of sayings do have some limited
value in
linguistic research and perhaps in the study of the history
of the church, they are of no direct value whatever for 4S in learning
what we should believe about the life and teachings f Christ, Or in
formulating
doctrinal or ethical convictions
The sufficiency of Scripture shows uS that no modern revelations
from God are to be placed on
level equal to Scripture in authority:
At various times throughout the history of the church; and
particularly in the modern charismatic movement; people have
claimed that God has given revelations through them for the benefit
of the church: However we may evaluate such claims_
we must be
careful never to allow (in theory or in practice) the placing of such
revelations on
level equal to Scripture.
We must insist that God
does not require us to believe anything about himself or his work in
the world that is contained in these revelations but not in Scripture.
And we must insist that God does not require uS t0 obey any moral
directives that come to us through such means but that are not
confirmed by Scripture_
The Bible contains everything we need
God t0 tell us for
and
him perfectly:
writings
obey
trusting
obeying
should also be noted at this point that whenever challenges t0 the
sufficiency of Scripture have come in the form of other documents
be placed alongside Scripture (whether from extrabiblical
Christian literature of the first century or from the accumulated
teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, or from the books of
various cults such as the Book of Mormon), the result has always
been (1) to deemphasize the
of the Bible itself and (2) to
begin to teach some
that are contrary to Scripture.
This is
danger of which the church must constantly be aware_
With
regard to
the Christian life
the sufficiency of
Scripture reminds us that nothing is sin that is not forbidden by
Scripture either explicitly or by implication. To walk in the law of
the Lord is to be "blameless" (Ps. 119.1). Therefore we are not to
add prohibitions t0 those already stated in Scripture_
From time [0
time there may be situations
which it would be wrong; for
example; for an individual Christian t0 drink coffee or Coca-Cola;
OrtO
attend movie theaters
O1 t0 eat meat offered to idols (see
Cor: 8-10), but unless some specific
0r' some
general
principle of Scripture can be shown to prohibit these (O1 any other
activities) for all believers for all time; we must insist that these
activities are nOL in themselves sinful and
are not in all
situations prohibited by God for his people_
This also
an important principle because there is always the
tendency among believers to begin t0 neglect the regular daily
searching of Scripture for guidance and to begin to live by
set of
written Or' unwritten rules (or denominational traditions)
concerning
what one does or does not d in the Christian life_
Furthermore; whenever we add to the list of sins that are prohibited
by Scripture itself; there will be harm to the church and to the lives
of individual believers_
The
Spirit will not empower
obedience t0 rules that do not have God's approval from Scripture,
nor will believers generally find delight in obedience
commands
that do not accord with the laws of God written on their hearts. In
SUME
cases, Christians may repeatedly and earnestly plead
God for "victory'
over
supposed sins that are in fact no sins atall,
yet no "victory'
will be given
for the attitude or action in question

sin and
not
displeasing to God. Great

continued 0r even
increasing disobedience to these
new
'sins'
will result; together with
false sense of guilt and
resulting alienation from God. Often there arises an increasingly
uncompromising and legalistic insistence on these new rules on the
part of those who do follow them; and genuine fellowship among
believers in the church will fade away: Evangelism will often be
stifled, for the silent proclamation of the gospel that comes from the
lives of believers will at least seem (t0 outsiders) to include the
additional requirement that one must fit this uniform pattern of life
in order to become
member of the body of Christ.
One clear example of such an addition to the commands of
Scripture
found in the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church
artificial" methods of birth control,
policy that finds no valid
support in Scripture: Widespread disobedience, alienation
and false
guilt have been the result: Yet such is the propensity of human
nature t0 make such rules that othel
examples can probably be
found in the written Or unwritten traditions of almost every
denomination.
The sufficiency of Scripture also tells Us that nothing is required
of us by God that is not commanded in Scripture either explicitly or
by implication: This reminds us that the focus of our search for
God's will ought to be on Scripture; rather than on seeking
guidance through prayer for changed circumstances Or altered
or direct
guidance from the Holy Spirit apart from
Scripture. It also means that if someone claims
have
message
from God telling us what we ought t0 do, we need never assume
that it is sin t0 disobey such
message unless it can be confirmed
by the application of Scripture itself to our situation.
The discovery of this great truth could bring tremendous
and
peace
the lives of thousands of Christians who,
spending
countless hours
God's will outside of Scripture
are often
uncertain about whether they have found it. In fact; many Christians
today have very little confidence in their ability t0 discover God $
will with any degree of certainty Thus, there is little striving to do
God'$ will (for who can know it?
and little growth in holiness
before God
The opposite ought to be tnue_
Christians who are convinced of the
sufficiency of Scripture should begin eagerly
seek and find God $
feelings
joy =
seeking
will in Scripture: They should be eagerly and
regularly growing in
obedience to God, knowing
freedom and peace in the
Christian life. Then they would be able to say with the psalmist:
will
your law continually;
for ever and ever;
and
shall walk at liberty;
for
have sought your precepts:
Great peace have those who love your
nothing can make them stumble: (Ps. 119.44-45, 165)
7. The sufficiency of Scripture reminds us that in our doctrinal and ethical
should emphasize what Scripture emphasizes and be content with
what God has told uS in Scripture. There are some subjects about which God
has told us little
nothing
the Bible:
We must remember that
The secret
things belong to the LORD our God" (Deut. 29.29) and that God has revealed
LO 4S in Scripture exactly what he deemed right for uS_
We must accept this
and not think that Scripture is something less than it should be
begin to
wish that God had given us much more information about subjects on which
there are very few scriptural references_
Of course
there will be some
situations where we are confronted with
particular
problem that requires
great deal of attention, far greater than the emphasis that it receives in the
of Scripture _
But those situations should be relatively infrequent and
should not be representative of the general course of our
ministries_
It is characteristic of many cults that
emphasize obscure
portions or teachings of Scripture (one thinks of the Mormon
emphasis on baptism for the dead
subject that is mentioned in
only one
VerSe
in the Bible [1 Cor: 15.29],in
phrase whose exact
meaning
is apparently impossible now t0 determine with certainty)
But
similar error was made by an entire
generation of liberal New
Testament scholars in the earlier part of this century; who devoted
most of their scholarly lives
futile search for the sources
"behind" our present gospel
narralives 0r t0
search for the
authentic" sayings of Jesus_

similar pattern has tOo often occurred among
evangelicals within various denominations

that have divided evangelical Protestant denominations from one
another have almost uniformly been matters on which the Bible
places relatively little emphasis, and matters in which our
conclusions must be drawn from skillful inference much more than
from direct biblical statements. For example; abiding
denominational differences have occurred or have been maintained
ovei
the "proper" form of church government; the exact nature of
Christ'$ presence in the Lord $ Supper; the exact sequence of the
events
surrounding Christ '$ return, the categories of persons who
should be admitted tO the Lord' $
the way in which God
planned that the merits of Christ'$ death would be
believers and not applied to unbelievers; the proper subjects for
baptism, the correct understanding of the "baptism in the Holy
Spirit;
and so forth:
We should not say that these issues are all unimportant; no
should
say that Scripture gives no solution to any
them (indeed, with
respect t0 many of them
specific solution will be defended in
subsequent chapters of this book).
However; since all of these
topics receive relatively little direct emphasis in Scripture; it is
ironic and tragic that denominational leaders will so often give
much of their lives [0
defending precisely the minor doctrinal points
that make their denominations different from others_
Is such effort
really motivated by
desire to bring unity of understanding t0 the
church, or
might
stem in some measure from human pride_
desire tO retain power over others
and an attempt at self-
justification, which is displeasing to God and ultimately unedifying
to the church?
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
In the process of growing in the Christian life and deepening your
relationship with God, approximately how much emphasis have You
placed on
the Bible itself and how much on reading other
Christian books? In seeking to know God's will for your daily life, what
is the relative emphasis you have put on reading Scripture itself and on
other Christian books? Do you think the doctrine of the
sufficiency of Scripture will cause YOu t0 place more emphasis on
reading Scripture itself?
What are some of the doctrinal or moral questions YOu are wondering
about? Has this chapter increased your confidence in the ability of
Scripture t0 provide
clear answer for some of those questions?

In the light of this chapter; how would yOu find God*s "perfect"
tor
your life? Is it possible that there would be more than one "perfect"
choice in many decisions we make? (Consider Ps
1.3 and

seeking an answer: )
Have there been times when you have understood the principles of
Scripture well enough with regard to
specific situation but have not
known the facts of the situation well enough to know how to apply those
scriptural principles corectly? In seeking
know God $ will, can there
be any other
need to know except (a) the
of Scripture
and (b) the facts of the situation in question, together with
skill in
applying (a) t0 (b) correctly? What then is the role of prayer in seeking
guidance? What should we pray for?

Foundation"
Few if any hymns deal specifically with the sufficiency of
Scripture, perhaps because Christians have failed to realize the
comfort and peace that this doctrine brings [0 the Christian
life_
But the first verse of the
following hymn contains
statement
of this doctrine. It begins by telling us that God has laid
firm
foundation for our faith in his Word_
Then
says,
What more can
he say than t0 you he hath said
The rich and full promises of
God throughout Scripture are sufficient for our every need in every
circumstance_
This should be great cause for rejoicinge
The
subsequent verses contain quotations
paraphrases, and allusions t0
promises of God that are scattered throughout Scripture; many of
them from Isaiah:
Verses 2-6 are all written as sentences thar are
spoken by God to uS, and when we sing them we should think of
ourselves singing the words of God'$ promises t0 others in the
congregation for their comfort and encouragement
How firm
foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in his excellent Word!

You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

Chapter 9
The Existence of God
How do we know that God exists?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
How do we know that God exists? The answer can be given in IWO
parts: First, all people have an inner sense of God. Second, we
believe the evidence that is found in Scripture and
nature:.
Humanitr",
SeIe 0l Gud
All persons everywhere have
inner sense that God exists
that they are his creatures; and that he is their Creator: Paul says
that even Gentile unbelievers "knew God" but did not honor him as
God or give thanks to him (Rom: 1.21). He says that wicked
unbelievers have
exchanged the truth about God for
lie" (Rom:
1.25) , implying that they actively or willfully rejected some truth
about God $ existence and character that
knew: Paul says that
"what can be known about God is plain to them;
and adds that this
is "because God has shown it t0 them'
(Rom. 1.19).
Yet Scripture also recognizes that some people
this inner sense
of God and even
thar God exists . It is
the
who says in
his heart;
There is no God" (Ps. 14.1; 53.1). It is the wicked person
who first
curses and renounces the LORD'
and then in pride
repeatedly thinks "there is no God" (Ps. 10.3-4). These passages
indicate both that sin leads people to think irrationally and to deny
God'$ existence_
and that it is someone who is
thinking irrationally
who has been deceived who will say; " There is no God
Paul also recognizes that sin will cause people t0
their
knowledge of God: he
of those who "by their wickedness
suppress the truth'
(Rom: 1:18) and says that those who do this are
without excuse
for this denial of God (Rom 1.20).
series of
active verbs indicates that this is
willful suppression of the truth
deep,
they
deny

fvol "
deny
speaks
(Rom:
1.23
28,32)."
In the life of
Christian this inner awareness of God becomes
stronger and more distinct: We
begin
to know God as our
Father in heaven (Rom: 8.15) , the
Spirit bears witness with
our spirits that we are children of God (Rom: 8.16), and we
CUME
know Jesus Christ
within our hearts (Eph 3.17; Phil. 3.8, 10;
Col: 1.27; John 14.23). The intensity of this awareness for _
Christian is such that though we have not seen our Lord Jesus
Christ; we indeed love him
Peter 1.8)-
Eelieting the Evidenc
In addition t0 people
inner awareness of God that bears clear
witness t0 the tact that God exists
clear evidence of his existence is
to be seen in Scripture and in nature_
The evidence that God exists is of course found throughout the
Bible: In fact, the Bible everywhere assumes that God exists. The
first verse of Genesis does not present evidence for the existence of
God but begins immediately t0 tell us what he has done: "In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth:
It we are
convinced that the Bible is true
then we know from the Bible not
only that God exists but also very much about his nature and his
acts.
The world also gives abundant evidence of God $ existence. Paul
says that God $ eterna
nature and deity have been "clearly
perceived in the
that have been made'
(Rom. 1.20). This
broad reference to "the things that have been made" suggests that in
some sense every created thing gives evidence of God'$ character:
Nevertheless;
is man himself, created in the image of God
who
most abundantly bears witness t0 the existence of God: whenever
we meet another human being;
we should (if our minds are
correctly) realize that such an incredibly intricate, skillful,
communicative living creature could only have been created by an
infinite, all-wise Creator:
In addition t0 the evidence seen in the existence of
human
there is further excellent evidence in nature. The "rains and
fnuitful seasons'
as well as the
food and gladness" that all people
experience and benefit from are also said by Barnabas and Paul to
loving

beings;
be witnesses
God (Acts 14.17). David tells us of the witness of
the heavens: "The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the
firmament proclaims his handiwork: Day to day pours forth speech;
and night to night declares knowledge
(Ps. 19.1-2). To look
upward into the sky by day or by night is tO see Sun, moon, and
stars, sky and clouds, all continually declaring by their existence
and beauty and greatness that
powerful and wise Creator has
made them and sustains them in their order:
This wide variety of testimonies
God $ existence fTom various
parts of the created world suggests [O 4S that in one sense
everything that exists gives evidence of God'$ existence_
For those
who have eyes
see and evaluate the evidence correctly; every leaf
every tree_
blade of grass, every star in the sky; and every
other part of creation all cry Out continuously; "God made mel God
made mel God made mel" [f our hearts and minds were not
blinded by sin, it would be impossible for uS t0 look closely at
leaf from any tree and say; "No one created this: it just happened:
The beauty of
snowflake; the majestic power of
thunderstorm;
the
honeybee; the refreshing taste of cold water; the
incredible abilities of the human hand-
all these and thousands of
other aspects of creation simply could not have come into existence
apart from the activity of an all-powerful and all-wise Creator:
Thus, for those who are correctly evaluating the evidence,
everything in Scripture and everything in nature proves clearly that
God exists and that he is the powerful and wise Creator that
Scripture describes him to be. Therefore_
when
believe that God
exiStS,
we are
basing our belief not on some blind
apart from
any evidence
but on an
overwhelming amount of reliable evidence
from God $ words and God$ works: It is
characteristic of true
faith that it is
confidence based on reliable evidence, and faith in
the existence of God shares this characteristic.
Furthermore
these evidences can all be seen as valid proofs for the
existence of God_
even
though some people reject them. This does
not mean that the evidence is invalid in itself, only that those who
reject the evidence are evaluating
wrongly.

The traditional "proofs" for the existence of God that have been
constructed by Christian (and some non-Christian) philosophers at
every
skill
hope
various points in history are in fact attempts t0 analyze the
evidence, especially the evidence from nature; in extremely careful
and
logically precise ways, in order t0 persuade people that it is not
rational to reject the idea of God'$ existence_
If it is true that sin
causes people t0 think irrationally; then these proofs are attempts [0
Cause
people to think rationally
correctly about the evidence for
God'$ existence_
in spite of the irrational tendencies caused by sin:
Most of the traditional
proofs for the existence of God can be
classified in four major types of argument:
The cosmological argument considers the fact that every known
thing in the universe has
cause:
Therefore, it reasons
the universe
itself must also have
cause
and the cause of such
great universe
can only be God:
The teleological argument is really
subcategory of the
cosmological argument: It focuses on the evidence of harmony;
order; and design in the universe
and argues that its design gives
evidence of an intelligent purpose (the Greek word telos means
end" or
'purpose
Since the universe appears to be
designed with
purpose _
there must be an
intelligent and
purposeful God who created
to function this way:
The ontological argument begins with the idea of God, who is
defined as
being
greater than which
can be imagined.
then argues that the characteristic of existence must
[0 such
being
since it is greater
exist than not t0 exist.
The moral argument begins from man'
sense of right and
wrong; and of the need for justice to be done_
and argues that there
must be
God who is the source of right and wrong and who will
someday mete out justice t0 all people:
Because all of these arguments are based on facts about the creation
that are indeed true facts_
we may say that all of these proofs (when
carefully constructed) are; in an objective sense
valid proofs_
valid in that they correctly evaluate the evidence and correctly
reason [0
conclusion
tact; the universe does have God as
its cause_
and
does show evidence of purposeful design; and God
does exist as
greater than which
can be imagined,
and God has given 4S
sense of right and wrong and
sense thal
'goal"
nothing
belong
They
Tue

his
judgment is coming someday The actual facts referred to in
these proofs, therefore; are true, and in that sense the proofs are
valid, even though not all people are persuaded by them:
But in another sense
if "valid" means
able
compel agreement
evem
from those who begin with false assumptions_
then ot course
none of the proofs is valid because not one of them is able to
compel agreement from everyone who considers them. Yet this is
because many unbelievers either begin with invalid assumptions or
do not reason correctly from the evidence_
It is not because the
proofs are invalid in themselves_
The value of these proofs, then, lies chiefly in overcoming some of
the intellectual
objections of unbelievers. They cannot bring
unbelievers tO saving faith, for that comes about through belief in
the testimony of Scripture: But
can help overcome objections
from unbelievers
and, for believers_
they can provide further
intellectual evidence for
something they have already been
persuaded of from their own inner sense of God and from the
testimony of Scripture.
Kandn UratcnmcWur -anMECTAA
PERMAOAASAEM
Finally;
must be remembered that in this sinful world God must
enable us to be persuaded or we would never believe in him. We
read that "the
of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelievers, t0 keep them from seeing the
light of the gospel of the
glory of Christ" (2 Cor: 4.4). Furthermore,
Paul says that
since, in
the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom,
it pleased God through the folly of what we preach
save those
who believe" ( 1 Cor: 1.21). In this sinful world, human wisdom is
inadequate for coming t0 know God. Thus, Paul'$ preaching came
demonstration of the Spirit and of power; thatyour faith might
not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God" (1 Cor: 2.5).
We are dependent upon God to remove the blindness and
irrationality caused by sin and
enable uS [0 evaluate the evidence
rightly; believe what Scripture says, and come to saving faith in
Christ

SCRIPTURE MEMORY
PASSAGE
Romans 1:18-20: For the wrath of God
revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the
truth:
For what can be known about God is plain t0 them, because God has
shown it to them: Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature;
namely; his eternal power and
has been clearly perceived in the
that have been made. So they are without excuse:
HYMN
The Spacious Firmament on High'
This hymn, based on Psalm 19:1-4, speaks of the testimony of the
sun, moon
and stars t0 their Creator: The word firmament in the
first verse refers tO the expanse or open space that is visible tO us as
we look upward from earth; it is the place in which the sun, moon;
and stars exist, and might be translated "sky
or "heavens _
The
third verse reminds us that though these heavenly bodies make no
sounds that can be heard by our physical ears, they nonetheless
proclaim; to all who think rightly about them; "The hand that made
divine_
The spacious firmament on high,
deity,
things
With all the blue ethereal sky;
And spangled heav'nS,
shining frame
Their great original proclaim.
Th' unwearied Sun, from day t0 day;
Does his Creator'$ pow' r display;
And publishes
every land
The work of an Almighty hand.
Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
And
nightly
the list'ning earth
Repeats the story of her birth;
Whilst all the stars that round her burn;
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as
roll,
And spread the truth from
What though in solemn silence all
Move round this dark terrestrial
ball?
What though nor real

Amidst their radiant orbs be found?
In reason $ ear they all rejoice,
And utter forth
glorious voice;
For ever singing; as they shine,
"The hand that made uS is divine_

The Knowability of God
Can we really know God? How much of God can we know?
EAFL
ANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Necessity
for God
Revez
Himself
If we are to know God atall; it is necessary that he reveal himself to
Even when
discussing the revelation of God that comes through
nature, Paul says that what can be known about God is plain to
people "because God has shown it I0 them "
(Rom: 1.19). The
natural creation reveals God because he chose t0 have himself
revealed in this way:
With
regard
the personal knowledge of God that comes in
salvation
this idea is even more explicit Jesus says_
~No one
knows the Son except the Father; and no one knows the Father
except the Son and any one I0 whom the Son chooses t0 reveal
him
(Matt: 11.27). This kind of knowledge of God is not found
through human effort Or wisdom: "in the wisdom of God, the world
did not know God through wisdom
Cor: 1.21; cf:
Cor: 2.14;
Cor: 4.3-4; John 1.18).
The necessity for God tO reveal himself t0 US also is seen in the fact
that sinful people misinterpret the revelation about God found in
nature_
Those who "by their wickedness suppress the truth" are
those who "became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds
Were
darkened
they exchanged the truth about God for
lie"
(Rom. 1:18,21,25). Therefore
need
Scripture if we are [0
interpret natural revelation rightly Hundreds of false religions in
the world are evidence of the way sinful people_
without guidance
from Scripture;
always misunderstand and distort the revelation
about God found in nature_
But the Bible alone tells us how t0
understand the testimony about God from nature:
Therefore we
Wvill
depend on God's active communication
uS in Scripture for our
true knowledge of God_
AeatAI
LeTuandeannd
Because God is infinite and we are finite or limited, we can never
fully understand God. In this sense God is said to be
incomprehensible, where the term incomprehensible is used with an
older and less common sense
unable to be fully understood:
This
sense must be clearly distinguished from the more common
meaning_
unable tO
be understood
Itis not true
say that God is
unable
be understood
but it is true t0 say thal he cannot be
understood fully or exhaustively.
Psalm 145 says,; "Great is the LORD_
and greatly to be praised, and
his greatness is unsearcnable
(Ps. 145.3). God $ greatness is
beyond searching Out or discovering
it is tOO great ever to be fully
known
Regarding God's understanding-
Psalm 147 says_
"Great is
our LORD, and abundant in pOwer; his understanding is beyond
measure
(Ps: 147.5). We will never be able to measure or fully
know the
understanding of God: it is far too great for US to equal or
understand. Similarly; when thinking of God's knowledge of all
his ways_
David says, "Such knowledge is tOo wonderful for me; it
high;
cannot attain it" (Ps.
139.6; cf: v 17).
Paul implies this
incomprehensibility of God when he says that "the
Spirit searches everything_
even the depths of God,
and then goes
on tO say that
no one
comprehends the
of God except the
Spirit of God" (1 Cor: 2.10-12).
At the end ot
discussion 0n
the history of God's great plan of redemption, Paul breaks forth into
praise: "0 the depth of the riches and wisdom and
knowledge of
Godl
unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his
ways!'
(Rom. 11.33).
These verses allow US t0 (ake our
understanding of the
incomprehensibility of God one
further: It is not only true that
we can never fully understand God; it is also true that we
cum
never
fully understand any single
about God. His greatness (Ps.
145.3), his understanding (Ps. 147.5) , his
knowledge (Ps_
139.6),
his riches,
wisdom, judgments, and ways (Rom: 11.33) are all
beyond our ability t0 understand fully. Other verses also support
this idea: as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are God'$
things
long
How
stcp
thing
ways higher than our ways and his thoughts than our thoughts (Isa
55.9). Job says that God $ great acts in creating and sustaining the
"but the outskirts of his ways_
and exclaims; "how small
whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can
understand?" (Job 26.14; cf: 11.7-9; 37.5).
Thus,
we may know something about God's love_
power; wisdom;
and s0 forth: But we can never know his love completely or
exhaustively We can never know his power exhaustively. We can
never know his wisdom exhaustively, and s0 forth: In order [0 know
any single
about God exhaustively we would have to know it
as he himself knows it: That is_
we would have t0 know it in its
relationship to everything else about God and in its relationship t0
everything else about creation throughout all eternity! We can only
exclaim with David_
"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is
high,
cannot attain it" (Ps. 139.6).
This doctrine of God $ incomprehensibility has much positive
application for our own lives. It means that we will never be able to
know
'[OO much'
about God, for we will never run out of things
leam about him; and
will thus never tire in delighting in the
discovery of more and more of his excellence and of the greatness
of his works_
Even in the age
come, when we are freed
the presence of
sin; we will never be able fully to understand God or any one
about him. This is seen from the fact that the passages cited above
attribute God $ incomprehensibility not t0 our sinfulness but to his
infinite greatness. It is because we are finite and God is infinite that
will never be able to understand him fully:
For all eternity
will be able to go on increasing in our knowledge of God and
delighting ourselves more and more in him; saying with David as
we learn more and more of God'$ own thoughts
"How precious
are your thoughts_
0 God! How vast is the sum of them! If [
would count them; they are more than the sand" (Ps. 139.17-18).
But if this is s0 in eternity future,
then it certainly must be s0 in this
In fact; Paul tells us that if we are t0 lead
life
worthy of the
Lord, fully pleasing to him
must be one in which we are
continually "increasing in the knowledge of God" (Col. 1:10). We
should be growing
our knowledge of God through our entire
lives
eatth
thing
from
thing
life.
If we ever wished t0 make ourselves
equal to God in knowledge
if we wished t0 derive satisfaction from the sin of intellectual pride,
the fact that we will never stop growing in knowledge of God
would be
discouraging
for uS
might become frustrated
that God is
subject of study that we will never master! But if we
rather delight in the fact that God alone is God, that he is always
infinitely greater than we are; that we are his creatures who owe
him worship and adoration; then this will be
very
encouraging
idea. Even though we spend time in Bible study and fellowship
with God every day of our lives
there will always be more t0 learn
about God and his relationships tO us and the world, and thus there
will always be more that we can be thankful for and for which we
can give him praise:
When we realize this, the prospect of
lifelong
habit of
regular Bible study, and even the prospect of
lifetime of
study of
theology (if it is
that is solidly grounded in God's
Word), should be
exciting prospect [0 4S. To study and
teach God's Word in both formal and informal
ways will always be
great privilege and joy
We Can Knoy God Trul;
Even though we cannot know God exhaustively;
we can know [rue
things about God. In fact, all that Scripture tells us about God is
true: It is true LO say that God
love
John 4.8), that God
light
John 1.5), that God is spirit (John 4.24), that God is just or
righteous (Rom 3.26), and so forth: To say this, does not imply or
require that We
know everything about God or about his love or his
righteousness or any other attribute
When
say that
have three
sonS _
that statement is entirely true, even though
do not know
everything about my sons, nor even about myself: So it is in our
knowledge of God: we have true knowledge of God from Scripture,
evem
though we do not have exhaustive knowledge. We can know
some of God $ thoughts
even many of then
from Scripture; and
when we know them, we_
like David, find them to be "precious'
(Ps. 139.17).
Even more
significantly, it is God himself whom we know; not
simply facts about him or actions he does:
We make
distinction
between knowing facts and knowing persons in our ordinary use of
English. It would be true for me to say that
know many facts
about the president of the United States_
but
would not be true tor
me t0 say that
know him: To say that
know him would imply that
thing
theology
very
had mer him and talked with him, and that
had developed at least
some degree
personal relationship with him.
Now some people say that we cannot know God himself; but that
we can only know facts about him or know what he does_
Others
have said that we cannot know God as he is in himself; but we can
only know him as he relates t0 us (and there is an implication that
these two are somehow different). But Scripture does not speak that
way: Several
passages speak of our knowing God himself We read
God'$ words in Jeremiah:
Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the mighty man
glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches-
but let him
who glories glory in this; that he understands and knows me_
that
am
the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice_
and righteousness in
the earth; for in these
delight; says the LORD. (Jer: 9.23-24)
Here God says that the source 0f OUr joy and sense of importance
ought to come not from our Own abilities or possessions, but from
the fact that we know him. Similarly; in praying t0 his Father; Jesus
say;
And this is eternal life, that they know YOu the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17.3). The
promise of the new covenant is that all shall know God, "from the
least of them t0 the
greatest" (Heb_
8.11), and John' s first epistle
tells us that the Son of God has come and given us understanding
"I0 know him who is true'
(1 John 5.20; see also Gal. 4.9; Phil.
3.10;
John 2.3; 4.8). John can say;
write t0 YOu; children;
because YOu know the Father-
John 2.13).
The fact that we do know God himself is further demonstrated by
the realization that the richness of the Christian life includes
personal relationship with God As these passages imply; We have
far greater privilege than mere knowledge of facts about God. We
speak to God in prayer; and he speaks tO us through his Word. We
commune with him in his presence
we sing his praise, and we are
aware that he personally dwells among 4S and within 4S t0 bless uS
(John 14.23). Indeed_
this personal relationship with God the
Father; with God the Son, and with God the Holy Spirit may be said
be the greatest of all the blessings of the Christian life.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Sometimes people say that heaven sounds boring:
How does the fact that
things
could
God is
incomprehensible yet knowable help to answer that objection?
How can we be sure that when we reach heaven God
not tell us that
most of what we had learned about him was wrong_
and that we would
have to forget what we had learned and
begin
leamn different
about _
Do You want tO g0 on knowing God more and

deeply for all
eternity? Why or why not? Would you like sometime t0 be able to know
God exhaustively? Why or why not?
Why do You think God decided to reveal himself to us? Do you learn
more about God from his revelation
nature 0r his revelation in
Scripture? Why do you think it is that God s thoughts are "precious
us (Ps. 139.17)? Would you call your present relationship t0 God
personal relationship? How is
similar tO your relationships with other
people, and how is
different? What would make your relationship with
God better?

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
(Verse
of this passage tells us that God can never be fully known,
but the fact that David
praising God and speaking
hin shows
also that he does know true things about God and does have
personal relationship to him.)

[will extol YOu, my God and
and bless your name for ever and ever:

Every
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised,
and his greatness
unsearchable:
HXM
Will Thee Praise; My God

Throughout the history of the church Christians have enjoyed
rearranging the words of the psalms to fit some poetic meter and
then setting these psalms tO music for personal 0r group worship:
This is an old metrical arrangement of the words t0 Psalm 145, set
the familiar melody of the hymn,
Jesus Shall
Where 'er
the Sun:"
Stanza
speaks of God*$ incomprehensibility
The Lord
is great; he praise exceeds; his greatness fully search can none'
and many of the other stanzas speak of various attributes of God
that we know from Scripture_
It should give uS
oy to sing this song;
knowing both that we are
singing absolutely true
about God_
and that his greatness far exceeds any praise we will ever be able to
sing t0 him:
will thee praise, my God, 0
And
will ever bless thy name;
will extol thee every day
And evermore thy praise proclaim:
The Lord
great; he praise exceeds;
His greatness fully search can none;
Race shall to race extol thy deeds

Upon thy glorious majesty
And wondrous works my mind shall dwell;
Men shall recount thy dreadful acts_

The Character of God: < Incommunicable"
Attributes
How
God different from us?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Introduction
the Study
God 5 Character
Classifying God's Attributes_
When we come
talk about the character
of God
we realize that we cannot say everything the Bible teaches us about
God's character at once.
We need some way t0 decide which aspect of God' s
character (0 discuss
which aspect t0 discuss second
and s0 forth: In
other words
we need some way t0 categorize the attributes of God_
This
question is nOt as unimportant as it may seem There is the possibility that we
would adopt
misleading order of attributes Or that we would emphasize
some attributes s0 much that others would not be presented properly:
Several different
methods of classifying God $ attributes have been used_
this chapter we
adopt probably the most commonly used classification:
the incommunicable attributes of God (that is_
those attributes that God does
not share 0r
communicate'
to others) and the communicable attributes of
God (those God shares Or
communicates
with uS)
Examples of the incommunicable attributes would be God s eternity (God has
existed for all eternity; but we have not), unchangeableness (God does not
change_
but we do); or omnipresence (God is everywhere present, but we are
present only in one place at one time). Examples of the communicable
attributes would be love (God is love, and
we are able o love as well),
knowledge (God has knowledge, and we are able to have knowledge as well),
mercy (God is merciful, and we are able t0 be merciful too), or justice (God is
just and we,
too, are able to be just) This classification of God's attributes
into LWO major
categories is helpful, and most people have an initial sense of
which specific attributes should be called incommunicable and which should
be called communicable. Thus it makes sense
say that God's love is
communicable but his omnipresence is not:
first,
Will
However; upon further reflection we realize that this distinction, although
helpful; is not perfect_ That is because there is no attribute of God that is
completely communicable, and there is no attribute of God that is completely
incommunicable=
This will be evident if we think for
moment about some
things
already know about God_
For example, God $ wisdom would usually be called
communicable
attribute_
because we also can be wise_
But we will never be infinitely wise as
God is.
His wisdom is to some extent shared with uS_
but it is never fully
shared with uS_
Similarly; we can share God's knowledge in part; yet we shall
never share it fully, for God's thoughts are higher than ours
as the heavens
are
higher than the earth" (Isa. 55.9). We can imitate God $ love and share in
that attribute to some degree, but we will never be infinitely loving as God is_
So it is with all the attributes that are normally called
communicable
attributes'
God does indeed share them with us to some degree_
but none of
these attributes is completely communicable. It is better t0 say that those
attributes we call
communicable
are those that are more shared with uS:
Those attributes we call "incommunicable" are better defined by
saying that
they
altributes
God that are less shared by US. Not one of the
incommunicable attributes
God is completely without some
in the
character of human
For example,
God
unchangeable, while we
change_
But we do not change completely; for there are some aspects of our
characters that remain largely unchanged: our individual identities, many of
ouI
personality traits, and some of our long-term purposes remain
substantially unchanged over many years
will remain largely unchanged
once
are set free from sin and begin
live in God $ presence forever):
Similarly, God is eternal, and we are subject to the limitations of time
However; we see some reflection of God'$ eternity in the fact that we will live
with him forever and enjoy eternal life, as well as in the fact that we have the
ability t0 remember the past and t0 have
strong sense of awareness of the
future (unlike much of God $ creation; cf: Eccl 3.11). God $ attributes of
independence and omnipresence are perhaps those that are least easy t0 see
reflected in our Own natures, but even these can be seen t0 be faintly reflected
in us when we compare ourselves with much of the rest of God'$ creation: as
we grow to adulthood we attain some degree of independence from others for
existence_
and, though we cannot be
mOrE
than one place at one time
have the ability t0 act
ways that have effects in many different places at
once (this
sets US apart from most of the rest of creation):
We will use the two categories of "incommunicable" and
communicable"
dre
likeness
beings.
(and
again
attributes then; while
realizing that
are not
entirely precise
classifications, and that there is in reality much overlap between the
categories_
2. The Names of God in Scripture_
In the Bible
person '$ name
description of his or her character: Likewise
the names of God in Scripture
are various descriptions of his character: In
broad sense_
then, God $
name'
is equal to all that the Bible and creation tell us about God. When we pray;
"Hallowed be Your name
as part of the Lord $ Prayer (Matt: 6.9), we are
praying that people would speak about God in
way that is honoring to him
and that accurately reflects his character: This honoring of God'$ name can be

command that we not dishonor God'$ reputation
either by words that speak of him in

actions that do not reflect his true character:

negating
concepts that we know from our experience (eternity is not being limited by

The point of collecting all these passages is t0 show; first; that in one sense or
another all of creation reveals something about God tO us, and that the higher
creation, especially man who
made in God'$ image; reveals him more fully
The second reason for mentioning this long list is t0 show that all that we
know about God from Scripture comes t0 US in terms that we understand

term; we can say that all that Scripture says about God uses
anthropomorphic language
that is, language that speaks of God in human
terms.
Sometimes people have been troubled by the fact that there is
anthropomorphic language in Scripture. But this should not be troubling
for; if God is going to teach us about things we do not know by direct
experience (such as his attributes), he has t0 teach uS
terms of what we do
know. This is why all that Scripture says about God is

from its immediate context or from the rest of what Scripture says
about God_
If we did that; we would run the risk of misunderstanding or of

understanding of the meaning of "love" when applied to God is not identical

Thus, anthropomorphic language about God is
true when it occurs in Scripture; but it can be understood rightly only by
continual reading of Scripture throughout our lives in order that
may
understand this language in the context of all of Scripture _
There
yet
third reason for pointing out the great diversity of descriptions
about God taken from human experience and from the natural world. This
language should remind us that God made the universe So that it would show
forth the excellence of his character; that is, that
would show forth his glory:
God is worthy
receive glory because he created all things (Rev: 4:11);
therefore; all things should honor him.
Psalm 148 is an example of all creation being summoned to give praise to
God:
Praise him, sun and moon,
praise him; all you shining stars!
Praise the LORD from the earth;
YOu sea monsters and all deeps,
fire and hail, Snow and frost;

love;
Let them praise the name of the Lord,
for his name alone is exalted;
his glory is above earth and heaven (Ps
148.3
7-11, 13)
As we leamn about God'$ character from Scripture
it should open our eyes
and enable uS t0 interpret creation rightly: As
result; we will be able t0 see
reflections of the excellence of God's character everywhere in creation: "the
whole earth is full of his glory" (Isa. 6.3).
It must be remembered that though all that Scripture tells us about God is
true, it is not exhaustive. Scripture does not tell us
everything about God s
character: Thus_
we will never know God $
or complete
name
in the
sense that we will never understand God $ character exhaustively. We
nevem
know all there is to know about God. For this reason theologians have
sometimes said, "God has many names, yet God has no name
God has many
names in that we know many true descriptions of his character from Scripture,
but God has no name in that
will never be able to describe or understand
all of his character:
Balanced Definitions of God'$ Incommunicable Attributes. The
incommunicable attributes of God are perhaps the most easily misunderstood
probably because they represent aspects of God*s character that are least
familiar tO our experience_
In this chapter, therefore, each of the
incommunicable attributes of God is defined with
DYU-
part sentence: The
first part defines the attribute under discussion_
and the second part
guards
misunderstanding the attribute by
balancing
opposite
aspect that relates t0 that attribute. For example; God $
unchangeableness is
defined as follows:
God is unchanging in his
perfections;
puiposes_
and
promises, yet God does act; and he acts differently in response to different
situations
The second
of the sentence guards against the idea that
unchangeableness means inability to act at all. Some people do understand
unchangeableness in this way; but such an understanding
inconsistent with
the biblical presentation of God $ unchangeableness:

Independence_
God' s independence is defined as follows: God does nor
need uS 0r" the rest of creation for anything. yet we and the rest of creation can
glorify him and bring him joy: This attribute of God is sometimes called his
self-existence or his aseity (from the Latin words

Scripture in several places teaches that God does not need any part of creation
in order t0 exist or for any other reason. God is
absolutely independent and
self-sufficient. Paul proclaims t0 the men of Athens_
The God who made the
world and
everything in it,
Lord of heaven and earth; does not live in
shrines made by man, nor is he served by human hanas
as though ne needed
anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything
(Acts 17.24-25).
The implication is that God does not need anything from
mankind:
God asks Job_
"Who has given
that
should repay him? Whatever is
under the whole heaven is mine
(Job 41.11). No one has ever contributed tO
God anything that did not first come from God who created all
Similarly,

in the field is mine. If

would not tell you; for the world and
all that is in it is mine
(Ps. 50.10-12).
People have sometimes thought that God created human beings because he
was lonely and needed fellowship with other persons_
[f this were true
would certainly mean that God is not completely independent of creation: It
would mean that God would need
create persons in order t0 be completely
happy or completely fulfilled in his personal
existence.
Yet there are some
indications in Jesus
words that show this idea
be inaccurale_
In John 17.5, Jesus prays; "Father; glorify me
your OWn
presence with the glory which
had with YOu before the world was made.
Here
an indication that there was
glory between the Father and
the Son before creation. Then in John 17.24, Jesus speaks t0 the Father of
my glory which you have given me in your love
or me before the foundation
of the world:
There was love and communication berween the Father and the
Son before creation_
These passages indicate explicitly what we can learn elsewhere from the
doctrine of the Trinity; namely; that among the persons of the Trinity there has
been perfect love and fellowship and communication for all eternity The fact
that God is three persons yet one God means that there was no loneliness Or
lack of personal fellowship on God $ part before creation. In fact; the love and
interpersonal fellowship, and the sharing of glory; have always been and will
always be far more perfect than any communion we as finite human
will ever have with God.
And as the second verse quoted above
of the
glory the Father gave t0 the Son; we should also realize that there is
giving
of glory by the members of the Trinity
one another that far surpasses any

With
t0 God'$ existence;
this doctrine also reminds us that only God
exists by virtue of his very nature_
and that he was never created and never
came into being
He always was. This is seen from the fact that all
that
exist were made by him
For yOu created all
and by your will they
existed and were created" [Rev: 41]; this is also affirmed in John 1.3; Rom_
1135-36;
Cor: 8.6). Moses tells us that God existed before there was any
creation:
Before the mountains
were
brought forth; Or
ever yOu had formed
the earth and the world_
from everlasting tO everlasting YOu are God" (Ps_
90.2). God s independence is also seen in his self-designation in Exodus 3.14:
"God said to Moses

will be what

but in both cases the implication is that
God'$ existence and character are determined by himself alone and are not
dependent on anyone or
anything else.
This means that God $ being has
always been and will always be exactly what it is
God
not dependent upon
any part ot creation fOr his existence 0r his nature.
without creation, God
would still be infinitely
infinitely just; eternal, omniscient; trinitarian,
and SO forth:
God'$ being is also something totally unique_
It is not jusc
that God does nor
need the creation for
anything; God could not need the creation for anything:
The difference between the creature and the Creator is an immensely vast
difference; for God exists in
fundamentally different order of being- It is not
just that we exist and God has always existed; it is also that God necessarily
exists in an infinitely better; stronger; more excellent way: The difference
between God s being and Ours is more than the difference between the sun
and
candle; more than the difference between the ocean and
raindrop
more than the difference between the arctic ice cap and
snowflake; more
than the difference between the universe and the room we are
God $
being is qualitatively different No limitation or imperfection in creation
should be projected onto Our thought of God. He is the Creator; all else is
creaturely. All else can pass away in an instant; he necessarily exists forever:
The balancing consideration with respect t0 this doctrine is the fact that
and the rest of creation can glorify God and bring him joy This must be
stated in order tO guard against any idea that God's independence makes uS
meaningless. Someone might wonder; if God does not need us for anything
then are we important at all? Is there any significance

must be said that we are in
fact very meaningful because God has created us and he has determined that

God speaks of his sons and daughters from the ends of the earth as "every one

whom

formed and

(Isa. 43.7). Although God did not have t0 create US, he chose to do s0
totally

Eph: 1.11-12; Rev 411)
It is also true that we are able t0
real joy and delight to God. It is one of
the most amazing facts in Scripture that God actually delights in his people
and
rejoices
over them: Isaiah prophesies about the restoration of God $
people:
You shall be
crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD,
and
diadem in the hand of your God_
You shall no more be termed Forsaken
and your land shall no more be termed Desolate;
but yOu shall be called My delight is in her;
and your land Married;
for the LORD delights in you
and your land shall be married_
(ne
bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
shall your God rejoice over You: (Isa. 62.3-5)
Similarly, Zephaniah prophesies that the LORD "will rejoice over You with
gladness, he will renew YOu
his love; he will exult over YOu with loud
singing as on
of festival" (Zeph: 317-18). God does not need us for
anything; yet it is the
of our existence that he chooses t0 delight
in 4S and to allow US
bring joy to his heart: This is the basis for personal
significance in the lives of all God*s people: to be significant to God is to be
significant in the most ultimate sense.
No greater personal significance can be
imagined:

immutability:
Evidence
Scripture: In Psalm 102 we find
contrast between things
that we may think to be permanent such as the earth or the heavens, on the
one hand_
and God
on the other hand. The psalmist says:
Of old you laid the foundation of the earth;
and the heavens are the work of your hands:
They will perish, but you endure;
will all wear out like
garment
You change them
raiment; and they pass away;
but VOu are the same
and your years have no end
(Ps. 102.25-27)
God existed before the heavens and earth were made, and he will exist long
after they have been destroyed. God causes the universe
change, but in
contrast t0 this change he is
same_
Referring
to his own
qualities of patience, long-suffering; and mercy; God
says, "For
the LORD do not change; therefore you, 0 sons of Jacob, are not
consumed" (Mal. 3.6). Here God uses
general statement of his
unchangeableness to refer tO some specific ways in which he does not change:
James reminds his readers that all good
come Ultimately from God
with
whom there iS no variation or shadow due [0
change
(James 1.17). His
argument is that since
gifts have always come from God, we can be
confident that only
gifts will come from him in the
because
character never changes in the slightest degree.
The definition given above specifies that God is unchanging
not in every
way that we might imagine
but only in ways that Scripture itself affirms. The
Scripture passages already cited refer either t0 God's own being Or t0 some
attribute of his character: From these
we can conclude that God is

future:
his
good
unchanging;
least with respect to his "being;
and with respect to his
perfections
(that is, his attributes 0r the various aspects of his character).
The great Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck notes that the fact that God is
unchanging
in his being is of the utmost importance for maintaining the
Creatorlcreature distinction, and for our worship of God:
The doctrine of God $ immutability is of the highest significance for
religion. The contrast between being and
becoming marks the
difference between the Creator and the creature. Every creature is
continually becoming
It is
changeable, constantly striving; seeks rest
and satisfaction, and finds this rest in God, in him alone
for only he is
pure being and no becoming: Hence, in Scripture God is often called
the Rock
The definition given above also affirms God $ unchangeableness or
immutability with respect to his purposes "The counsel of the LORD stands
for ever; the thoughts of his heart to all
generations'
(Ps. 33:11). This general
statement about God's counsel is supported by several specific verses that talk
about individua_
plans 0r purposes of God that he has had for all eternity
(Matt: 13.35; 25.34; Eph: 1.4, 11; 3.9,
11; 2 Tim: 2.19;
Peter 1.20; Rev:
13.8). Once God has determined that he will assuredly
something about;
his purpose is unchanging; and it will be achieved. In fact; God claims
through Isaiah that no one else is like him in this regard:
am God, and there is none like me,
declaring the end from the beginning
and from ancient times
not yet done;
saying
My counsel shall stand_
and
will accomplish all my purpose
have spoken, and
will bring it to pass;
have purposed, and
will do it: (Isa_
46.9-11)
Furthermore, God is unchanging in his promises:
Once he has promised
something; he will not be unfaithful to that promise_
God is not

thac
he should lie,
son of man, that he should repent: Has he said, and will he
not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfil it?
(Num: 23.19; cf:
Sam:
bring -
things
15.29).
Does God Sometimes Change His Mind? Yet when we talk about God
unchanging
in his purposes_
we may wonder about places in Scripture
where God said he would judge his people and then because of prayer Or the
people $ repentance (or both) God relented and did not bring judgment as he
had said he would. Examples of such withdrawing from threatened judgment
include the successful intervention of Moses in prayer tO prevent the
destruction of the people of Israel (Ex. 32.9-14), the adding of another fifteen
years
the life of Hezekiah (Isa. 38.1-6) , or the failure to bring promised
judgment upon Nineveh when the people repented (Jonah 34, 10).
Are these
not cases where God $ purposes in fact did change? Then there are other
passages where God is said t0 be SOry that he had carried out some previous
action. One thinks of God being sorry that he had made man upon the earth
(Gen: 6.6), or sOny that he had made Saul
(1 Sam: 15.10). Did not God' $
purposes change
these cases?
These instances should all be understood as true expressions of God'$ present
attitude or intention with respect to the situation as it exists at that moment If
the situation changes_
then ot course God'$ altitude 0r expression of intention
will also change. This is just saying that God responds differently
different
situations.
The example of Jonah preaching to Nineveh is helpful here
God
sees the wickedness of Nineveh and sends Jonah to proclaim,
"Yet
days_
and Nineveh shall be overthrown! " (Jonah 3.4). The possibility that God
would withhold judgment if the people repented is not explicitly mentioned in
Jonah'$ proclamation as recorded in Scripture, but it is of course implicit in
that warning
the purpose for proclaiming
warning
to bring about
repentance_
Once the people repented, the situation was different; and God
responded differently to that changed situation:
When God saw what they
did, how they turned from their evil way; God repented of the evil which he
had said he would do t0 them; and he did not do it" (Jonah 3.10).
The situations with Hezekiah and with the intercession of Moses are similar:
God had said that he would send judgment; and that was
true
declaration,
provided that the situation remained the same:
But then the situation changed:
someone started to pray earnestly (Moses in one case and Hezekiah in the
other)_
Here prayer itself was part of the new situation and was in fact what
changed the situation_
God responded t0 that changed situation by answering
the prayer and withholding judgment
In the cases of God being SOrry that he had made man,
that he had made
Saul king
these tO0 can be understood as expressions of God $ present
being
king '
fony
displeasure toward the sinfulness of man: In neither case is the
language
strong enough to require US t0 think that if God could start
and act
differently; he would in fact not create man Or not make Saul king
It can
instead imply that God $ previous action led to events
in the short term,
caused him sorrow; but that nonetheless in the long term would ultimately
achieve his
purposes. This is somewhat analogous [0

The Question of God's Impassibility: Sometimes in
discussion of God's
attributes theologians have spoken of another attribute, namely; the
impassibility of God: This attribute; if true,
mean that God does not
have passions or emotions, but is "impassible,
not subject t0 passions: In
fact, chapter
of the Westminster Confession of Faith says that God is

our definition above about God's
unchangeableness, and affirms more than
that God does not change in his being; perfections

also affirms that God does not even feel emotions 0 "passions

14.15_
which in the
James Version reports Barnabas and Paul as
rejecting worship from the people at Lystra, protesting that
are nOl
but "men of like passions with you_
The implication of the KJV translation
might be that someone who
truly God
not have "like passions'
men do
or it might simply show that the apostles were
responding to the false
view of passionless gods assumed by the men of Lystra (see vv 10-11)
But if
the verse
rightly translated, it certainly does not prove that God has no
passions
emotions at all; for the Greek term here (homoiopathes) can
simply mean having similar circumstances 0r experiences_

Of course_
God does nOt have sinful passions

But the idea that God has no passions Or emotions at all clearly
conflicts with much of the rest of Scripture, and for that reason
have nOr
affirmed God's impassibility in this book: Instead, quite the opposite is true,
for God
who is the origin of our emotions and who created our emotions,
certainly does feel emotions: God rejoices (Isa. 62.5). He is grieved (Ps.
78.40; Eph. 4.30). His wrath burns hot against his enemies (Ex 32:10). He
pities his children (Ps. 103.13). He loves with everlasting love (Isa. 54.8; Ps.
103.17). He is
God whose passions
we are t0 imitate for all etemity as we

systems of
theology: In the
of the Bible_
God is both infinite and
personal: he is infinite in that he is not subject tO any of the limitations of
humanity; Or of creation in general. He is far greater than everything he has
made, far greater than
anything else that exists.
But he is also personal: he
interacts with uS as
person; and we can relate t0 him as persons.
We can
pray
him; worship him, obey him; and love him; and he can speak [0 4S,
in VS_
and love uS.
Apart
the true
found in the Bible, no system of religion has
God who is both infinite and personal.
For example, the
of ancient
Greek and Roman
mythology were personal (they interacted frequently with
people), but they were not infinite:
they had weaknesses and frequent mora
failures
even petty rivalries. On the other hand, deism portrays
God who is
infinite but far tOo removed from the world to be personally involved in it:
Similarly, pantheism holds that God is infinite (since the whole universe is
thought to be God); but such
God can certainly not be personal 0r relate to
uS as persons_
The error of process theology fits this general pattern. Its advocates are
convinced thar
God who is unchanging in his being
S0 different from the
rest
of creation
SO infinite_
so unlimited by the change that characterizes all
of our existence
that he cannot also be personal in
way that we make
difference
him. So in order to gain
God who
personal, they think
have tO give up
God who is infinite for
God who is continually in process
of change_
This kind of
reasoning
is typical of many (perhaps all) objections
to the kind of God presented in the Bible. People say that if God is infinite
cannot be personal, or they say that if God is personal, he cannot be infinite.
The Bible teaches that God is both infinite and personal: We must affirm both
that God is infinite (0r unlimited) with respect t0 change that occurs in the

f. The Importance of God s Unchangeableness: At first it may not seem
important tO uS [0 affirm God'$
unchangeableness. The idea is s0 abstract
that we may not immediately realize its significance
But if we stop for
moment tO imagine what
would be like
God
change, the importance
of this doctrine becomes more clear: For example, if God could change (in his
perfections, purposes,
promises _
then any change would be either
for the better 0r for the worse
But if God changed for the better; then he was
not the best possible being when we first trusted him:
And how could

possible being
But if God could change for the

worse (in his very
then what kind of God might he become?
Might he
become, for instance,
little bit evil rather than wholly good? And if he could
become
little bit evil, then how do we know he could not change to become
largely evil
or" wholly evil? And there would be not one thing we could do
about it, tor he is SO much more
powerful than we are
Thus_
the idea that God
could change leads to the horrible possibility that thousands of years from
now we
might come t0 live forever in
universe dominated by
wholly evil,
omnipotent God. It is hard t0 imagine any thought more
terrifying:
How could
ever trust such
God who
change? How could we ever commit our
lives t0 him?
Moreover; if God could change with regard to his purposes
then even though
when the Bible was written he promised that Jesus
come back to rule
over
new heaven and new earth; he has perhaps abandoned that plan nOw;
and thus our hope in Jesus' return is in vain:
Or; if God could change in regard
his promises_
then how could we tTUSL
him completely for eternal life? Or
for anything else the Bible says? Maybe when the Bible was written he
promised forgiveness of sins and eterna)
life t0 those who trust in Christ, but
(if God can change) perhaps he has changed his mind on those promises nOw
how could we be sure? Or perhaps his omnipotence will change someday;
s0 that even though he wants
keep his promises_
no longer be able
do so.
A little reflection like this shows how absolutely important the doctrine of
God'$
unchangeableness is. If God is not unchanging
then the whole basis of
faith
begins to fall apart; and our
understanding of the universe begins t0
unravel:
is because
faith and hope and knowledge all ultimately
depend on
person who is infinitely worthy of trust
because he is absolutely
and eternally unchanging in his
perfections_
purposes_
and promises
3. Eternity. God'$ eterity may be defined as follows: God has no beginning;
end_
or" succession of moments in nis Own
and he sees all time equally
vividly, yet God sees events in time and aCtS in time:
Sometimes this doctrine is called the doctrine of God' s infinity with respect to
time.
To be "infinite
is to be unlimited_
and this doctrine teaches that time
does not limit God.
This doctrine is also related to God:
unchangeableness If it is true that God
does not change
then we must say that time does nOt change God:
has no
effect on his
perfections, purposes
promises_
But that means thar
time has no effect on God's knowledge, for instance:
God never leamns new

being;
forgets
for that would mean
change in his perfect
knowledge: This implies also that the passing of time does not add to or
detract from God's knowledge: he knows all things past; present; and future
and knows them all equally vividly:
God Is Timeless in His Own Being: The fact that God has no beginning
end is seen in Psalm 90.2: "Before the mountains were brought forth;
ever YOu had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting t0 everlasting
yOu are God:
Similarly, in Job 36.26, Elihu says of God
"the number
years is unsearchable_
God'$ eternity is also suggested by passages that talk about the fact that God
always
always exists_
am the Alpha and the Omega;
says the Lord
God
who is and who was and who is [0 come_
the Almighty
(Rev: 1.8; ci:
4.8).
It is also indicated in Jesus' bold use of
present tense verb that implies
continuing present existence when he replied to his Jewish adversaries,
"Before Abraham was_
am
(John 8.58). This statement is itself an explicit
claiming of the name of God, "[AM WHO [AM;
from Exodus 3.14,
Male
that also suggests
continual present existence: God is the eternal
AM,
the one who etemally exists_
The fact that God never began
exist can also be concluded from the fact
that God created all
and that he himself is an immaterial spirit: Before
God made the universe, there was nO matter, but then he created all
(Gen
1:1; John 1.3;
Cor: 8.6; Col. 1.16; Heb: 1.2). The study of physics
tells us that matter and time and space must all occur together: if there is no
matter; there can be no space or time either: Thus_
before God created the
universe
there was no "time
at least nOr in the sense of
succession of
moments one after another: Therefore_
when God created the universe, he also
created time_
When God
began
t0 create the universe, time began; and there
began
succession of moments and events one after another:
But
before there was
universe, and before there was time, God always existed,
without beginning; and without being influenced by time.
And
therefore, does not have existence in itself;
like the rest of creation;
depends on God'$ eternal being and power t0 keep
existing:
The
foregoing Scripture passages and the fact that God always existed before
there was any time combine tO indicate tO us that God's Own being does not
have
succession of moments Or any progress from one state of existence t0
things =

tine ,
but;
another: To God himself; all of his existence is always somehow
present;
though admittedly that idea is difficult for uS
understand, for it is
kind of
existence different from that which we experience
b. God Sees AlI Time Equally Vividly: It is somewhat easier for uS
understand that God sees all time
equally vividly:
We read in Psalm 90.4
For
thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past; Or as
watch in the night
is sometimes difficult for US t0 remember events that
occurred several weeks ag0
severa
months ag0_
several
years ag0
We
remember recent events more vividly; and the clarity of our memory fades
with the passing of time_
Even if it were possible for uS t0 live
thousand
years_
we would remember very few events from hundreds of years earlier;
and the clarity of that memory would be very low. But here Scripture tells uS
that God views
thousand years
as yesterday:
He can remember all the
detailed events of
thousand years at least as clearly as we can remember the
events of
yesterday.
In fact; to him
thousand years is
watch in the
night;
three
or four-hour period during which
guard would stand watch:
Such
short period of time would pass quickly and all the events would be
easily recalled_
Yet this is how
thousand years seems [0 God_
When we realize that the phrase
thousand years" does not imply that God
forgets
after 1,100 or
200 years_
but rather expresses as
time as
one might imagine, it becomes evident that all of past
is viewed by
God with great clarity and vividness: all of time since the creation
God
as if it just happened:
And it will always remain just that clear in his
consciousness, throughout millions of years of eternity future:
In the New Testament; Peter tells uS
"with the Lord
day is as
thousand
years_
and
thousand years as one day" (2 Peter 3.8). The second half of this
statement had already been made in Psalm 90_
but the first half introduces an
additional consideration; "One day is as
thousand years
that is, any one
from God'$ perspective seems to last for
thousand years
it is as if that
day never ends_
but is always being experienced. Again, since
thousand
years"
figurative expression for
as long
time aS we can imagine;
"all history;
can say Irom this verse that any one day seems t0 God t0 be
present t0 his consciousness forever:
Taking these two considerations together; we can say the following: in God $
perspective, any extremely
period of time is as if it just happened
And
any very short period of time (such as one
seems t0 God t0 last forever:
it never ceases t0 be
"present" in his consciousness. Thus, God sees and
knows all events past, present, and future with equal vividness- This should

never cause US t0 think that God does not see events in time and act in time
(see below) ; but just the opposite: God is the eternal Lord and Sovereign over
history; and he sees
more clearly and acts in it more decisively than any
other: But, once we have said
we still must affirm that these verses speak
God $ relationship
time in
way that we do nOt and cannot experience:
God'$ experience of time is nOt just
patient endurance through eons of
endless duration; but he has
qualitatively different experience of time than
we do_
This is consistent with the idea that in his own being
God is timeless_
he does not experience
succession of moments. This has been the dominant
view of Christian orthodoxy throughout the history of the church; though
has been frequently challenged, and even today many
theologians
We can picture God*$ relationship tO time aS in figure 1L.1. This diagram is
meant t0 show that God created time and is Lord over time. Therefore he can
see all events in time
equally vividly; yet he also can see events in time and
act in time _
The diagram also anticipates the following discussion, since it indicates that
God knows events in the future_
even the infinitely
eteral future. With
t0 the future_
God
frequently claims through the Old Testament
prophets that he alone
the one who knows and can declare future events.
"Who told this
Who declared
of old? Was
not [, the LORD? And
there is no other
besides me,
righteous God and
Savior; there is none
besides me'
(Isa. 45.21). Similarly;
read:
For
am God, and there
other;
am God, and there is none like me,
declaring the end from the beginning
and from ancient times things not yet done,
saying;
My counsel shall stand_
and
will accomplish all my purpose_
(Isa. 46.9-10)
Thus God somehow stands above time and is able
see
all as present in his
consciousness. Although the
is not perfect; we might think of the
moment we finish reading
novel. Before putting it back on the shelf we
might flip quickly through the pages once more, calling to mind the many
events that had occured in that novel. For

God Sees Events in Time and Acts in 'Time: Yet once all this has been
said it is necessary
against misunderstanding by completing the
definition of God's eternity: "yet God sees events

Paul writes_
"when the time had fully come ,
God sent forth his Son; born of
WOma_
born under the law; tO redeem those who were under the law" (Gal:
4.4-5). God observed clearly and knew exactly what was happening with
events in his creation as
occurred over time
We might say that God
watched the progress of time as various events occured within his creation.
'Then at the right
when the time had fully come
God sent forth his
Son into the world:
It is evident throughout Scripture that God acts within time and acts
differently at different points in time
For example,
Paul tells the men of
Athens
"The times of ignorance God overlooked

(Acts

description of

God acted_
God'
present way of
and
future activity that he will
cany out, all in time.
Indeed, the repeated emphasis on God's ability t0 predict the future in the Old
Testament prophets requires US tO realize that God predicts his actions at one
point in time and then carries Out his actions at
later point in time.
And on
larger scale, the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is God $ own record
of the way he has acted over time to
redemption to his people
We must therefore affirm both that God has no succession of moments in his

time; in short; he is the Lord who created time and who rules over it and uses
it for his Own purposes. God can act in time because he is Lord of time_
uses it to display his glory. In fact; it is often God's good pleasure t0 fulfill his
promises and carry out his works of redemption over
period of time so that
we might more readily see and appreciate his great wisdom, his patience, his
faithfulness
his lordship over all events, and even his
unchangeableness and
etemity.
d. We Will Always Exist in Time: Will we ever share in God $ eternity?
Specifically; in the new heaven and new earth which are yet t0 come_
time still exist? Some have thought that
would nOt: In fact, there is
hymn
that begins
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no

And we read in Scripture,
And the city has no need of sun or
moon t0 shine upon
for the glory of God is its light; and its lamp is the
Lamb
and there shall be no night there'
(Rev: 21.23,25; cf: 22.5).
Nevertheless, it is not true t0 say that heaven will be "timeless_
0r without
the presence of time or the passage of time
Rather; as long as
Ke 4rE
finite
creatures we will necessarily experience events one after another: Even the
passage that talks about no night
in heaven also mentions the fact that
the kings of the earth will bring into the heavenly city "the glory and the
honor of the nations'
(Rev: 21:26). We are told concerning the light of the
heavenly city; "By its light shall the nations walk" (Rev 21.24). These
activities of bringing things into the heavenly city and walking by the light of
the heavenly city imply that events are done one after another: Something
outside the heavenly city; and then at
later point in time this
is part of
the glory and honor of the nations that are brought into the heavenly city: To
cast one
crown before the throne of God (Rev: 4:10) requires that at one
moment the person has

and that at _
later moment that crown is cast
before the throne
To sing
new song of praise before God in heaven requires
that one word be sung after another: In

city is said t0 be "yielding its fruit each month" (Rev: 22.2), which implies
regular passage of time and the occurrence of events in time_
Therefore_
there will still be
succession 0f moments one after another and
happening one after another in heaven_
We will experience eternal life
not in an exact duplication of God $ attribute of etemity; but rather in
duration of time that will never end: we_
as God'$ people will experience

forever:
And night shall be no morez

(Rev:
22.5).
Omnipresence: Just as God is unlimited 0r infinite with respect t0 time_
God is unlimited with respect t0 space: This characteristic of God $ nature is
called God '$ omnipresence (the Latin prefix omni- means "all") God'$
omnipresence may be defined as follows: God does not have size or spatial
dimensions and
present at every point of space with his whole
yet
God acts differently in different places
The fact that God
Lord of space and cannot be limited by space is evident
from the fact that he created it; for the creation of the material world
(Gen: 1.1) implies the creation of space as well. Moses reminded the people
of God*s lordship over space:
Behold,
the LORD your God belong heaven
and the heaven of heavens, the
with all that is in it" (Deut: 10.14).
God Is Present Everywhere: Yet there are also specific passages that
speak of God'
presence in every pait of space.
We read in Jeremiah,
Am [ a
God at hand_
says the LORD, and not
God afar off
Can
man hide himself
in secrer places SO that
cannot see him? says the LORD_
not fill heaven
and earth? says the LORD'
(Jer: 23.23-24). God is here
rebuking
the prophets
who think their words Or thoughts are hidden from God: He
everywhere
and fills heaven and earth
God*s omnipresence is beautifully expressed by David:
Whither shall
g0 from your Spirit?
Or whither shall
flee from your presence?
ascend t0 heaven, YOu are therel
make my bed in Sheol, you are there=
take the wings of the moming
and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea;
even there your hand shall lead me_
and your right hand shall hold me: (Ps. 139.7-10)
will
being,
fitst
eatth
There
nowhere in the entire universe_
on land or sea
in heaven or in hell,
where one can flee from God $ presence.
We should note also that there is no indication that simply
part of God is in
one place and
part of him in another: It is God himself who is present
wherever David might g0.
We cannot say that some of God or just part of God
is present; for that would be t0 think of his being in spatia)
terms, as if he
were limited somehow by space_
It seems more
appropriate
say that God is
present with his whole being in every part of space (cf. also Acts 17.28 where
Paul affirms the correctness of the words,
"In him
live and move and have
0ur
and Col.
1.17
which says of Christ; "in him all
hold
together'
God Does Not Have Spatial Dimensions: While
seems necessary tOr uS
say that God $ whole being
present in every part of space,
01 at every
point in space, it is also necessary t0 say that God cannot be contained by any
space, no matter how
Solomon says in his prayer to God, "But will God
indeed dwell on the earth? Behold
heaven and the highest heaven cannor
contain you; how much less this house which
have built! "
8.27).
Heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain God; indeed, he cannot be
contained by the largest space imaginable (cf: Isa. 66.1-2; Acts 7.48). While
the thought that God is everywhere present with his whole being ought to
encourage uS greatly in prayer no matter where we are, the fact that no one
place can be said to contain God should also discourage Us from thinking that
there is some special place of worship that gives people special access to God:
he cannot be contained in any one place.
We should guard against thinking that God extends infinitely far in all
directions s0 thar he himself exists in
sort of infinite,
unending space:
Nor
should we think that God is somehow
"bigger space'
bigger area
surounding the space of the universe as We know it. All of these ideas
continue
think of God's being in spatial terms, as if he Were simply an
extremely large
Instead,
should try to avoid
of God in
terms f size 0r
spatial
dimensions. God is
being who exists without size Or
dimensions in space
In fact; before God created the universe, there was nO
matter Or' material SO there was no space either: Yet God still existed:
Where
was God? He was not in
place that we could call
"where
for there was
where'
space. But God still
was?
This fact makes us realize that God
relates [0 space in
far different way than

does_
He exists as
kind of being that is far different and far greater than
can imagine_

We must also be careful not to think that God himself is equivalent t0 any part
of creation Or t0 all of it A pantheist believes that everything is God_
Or that
God is everything that exists. The biblical perspective is rather that God is
present everywhere in his creation; but that he is also distinct from his
creation_
How can this be? 'The
analogy of
sponge filled with water is nOt
pertect; but it
helpful. Water is present everywhere in the sponge, but the
Walem
still completely distinct from the sponge_
Now this analogy breaks
down at very small points within the sponge
where we could say that there is
sponge at one point and not water; Or water and not sponge. Yet this is
because the analogy is dealing with two materials that have spatial
characteristics and dimensions;
while God does nOL
God Can Be Present to Punish, to Sustain, or t0 Bless: The idea of God $
omnipresence has sometimes troubled people who wonder how God can be
present; for example; in hell. In
iSn"
hell the opposite of God's presence_
the absence of God? This difficulty can be resolved by realizing that God is
present in different ways
different places, or that God acts differently
different places in his creation
Sometimes God is present to punish
terrifying passage in Amos vividly portrays this presence of God in judgment:
Not one of them shall flee away;
not one of them shall escape.
Though they dig into Sheol,
from there shall my hand take them;
though they climb up
heaven,
from there
will bring them down:
Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
from there
will search our and take them;
and though they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea,
there
will command the serpent; and it shall bite them:
And though they go into captivity before their enemies;
there
will command the sword_
and it shall slay them;
facl,
and
will set my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.
(Amos 9.1-4)
At other times God is present neither t0 punish nor to bless, but merely
present [0 SuSIain; Or t0
the universe existing and functioning in the way
he intended it [O function_
In this sense the divine nature
Christ is
everywhere present: "He is before all things, and in him all
hold
together" (Col. 1:17) The author of Hebrews says of God the Son that he is
(continually) "upholding the universe by his word of
(Heb: 1.3).
Yet at other times or in other places God is present to bless. David says,
your presence there is fulness of
in YOuI right hand are pleasures fOr
evermore
(Ps. 16.11). Here David is speaking not of God's presence t0
punish or merely tO sustain; but of God'$ presence to bless_
In fact, most of the time that the Bible talks about God's presence, it is
referring
God $ presence to bless. For example, it is in this way that we
should understand God $ presence above the ark of the covenant in the Old
Testament We read of
the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is
enthroned on the cherubim"
Sam: 44; cf. Ex 25.22),
reference t0 the
fact that God made his presence known and acted in a special way to bring
blessing and protection to his people at the location he had designated as his
throne; namely, the place above the two
golden figures of heavenly beings
cherubim'
that were over the tOp of the ark of the covenant: It is not that
God was not present
Isewhere; but rather that here he especially made his
presence known and here he especially manifested his character and brought
blessing to his people_
In the new covenant_
there is no one place on earth that God has chosen as his
particular dwelling place; for we can worship him anywhere (see John 4.20)
But now and for all eternity God has chosen the place the Bible calls
"heaven'
be the focus of the manifestation of his character and the
presence of his
and glory So when the new Jerusalem comes down
out of heaven from God, John in his vision hears
loud voice from God $
throne saying; "Behold, the dwelling of God is with men_
He will dwell with
them
and
shall be his people, and God himself will be with them" (Rev:
21.3). We might find

t0 say that God is

this way also Paul'
staremenm
about Christ can be understood: "In him the
whole fulness of deity dwells bodily" (Col. 2.9). In one sense f course we
could say that God*$ whole being is present at every point in space and
therefore at every point in every person; not only in Christ But there are [WO
difficulties with speaking this way:
The Bible never speaks about God $
presence in unbelievers
direct way; probably tO avoid any connection
between God and the responsibility or blame for evil deeds_
and probably also
avoid any
suggestion of God"$ presence to bless_
since it is only
presence

Furthermore_
this sense of "present
sustain" is not the sense
Paul has in mind in Colossians 2.9. In fact; there Paul does not even seem t0
mean simply
present to bless
in the same sense in which God is present to
bless in the lives of all believers. Rather; Paul seems t0 mean that in Christ
God'$ own nature is present t0 bless and
manifest his character in the
fullest and most complete way possible:
Our difficulty

unbelievers_
tor example_
leads US
realize that although the Bible
can
speak of God as
present everywhere_
when the Bible says that God
is "present" it usually means
present to bless:
That is, although there are
few references t0 God's presence to sustain or presence to punish, the vast
majority of biblical references to God's presence are simply more brief ways
of stating that he is present t0 bless. When we become more and more
familiar with this biblical pattern of speech; it becomes
and more
difficult to speak of God's presence in any other way: And perhaps
is even

clear explanation of Our meaning can be given:

man loves me; he
will keep my word
and my Father will love him, and
will come t0 him
and make our home with
and s0 forth: All of these verses talk about
God'$ presence and assume that we understand that they mean God'
presence
to bless:
paralleE
kind of expression, when the Bible talks about God
"far
away"
usually means he is
not present t0 bless_
For example_
Isaiah 59.2
says_
Your iniquities have made
separation between YOu and your God;
and Proverbs 15.29 declares: "The LORD is far from the wicked
but he hears
the prayer of the righteous.
summary, God
present in every
of space with his whole being; yet
being
mlore
him;
being
pant
God acts differently in different places
Furthermore, when the Bible speaks
of God $ presence, it usually means his presence to bless, and it is only
normal for our Own speech to conform to this biblical usage_
Herman Bavinck; in The Doctrine of God, quotes
beautiful
paragraph
illustrating the practical application of the doctrine of God $ omnipresence:
When YOu wish t0 do
something evil, YOu retire from the public into
your house where no enemy may see you; from those places of your
house which are open and visible to the eyes of men yOu remove
yourself into YOur room; even in your room yOu fear some witness
from another quarter; YOu retire into your heart; there yOu meditate-
is more inward than your heart Wherever; therefore_
You shall have
fled, there he is_
From yourself; whither will
flee? Will you not
follow yourself wherever You shall flee? But since there is One more
inward even than yourself; there is no place where YOu may flee from
God angry but to God reconciled. There is no place at all whither YOu
may flee:
Will you flee from him? Flee unto him:
Unity. The unity of God may be defined as follows: God is not divided into
parts, yet we see different attributes of God emphasized at different times.
This attribute of God has also been called God $ simplicity; using simple in the
less common sense of
not complex" or
not composed of parts_
But since
the word simple today has the more common sense of
easy t0 understand"
and
unintelligent or foolish;
it is more helpful now to speak of God $
unity
rather than his
simplicity:
When Scripture speaks about God 's attributes
never singles ouL one
attribute of God as more important than all the rest: There is an assumption
that
attribute is completely true of God and is true of all of God $
character: For example, John can say that "God is light"
John 1.5) and then
little later say also that "God is love
(1 John 4.8). There is no
suggestion
that part of God
light and part
God is love_
that God
partly light and
partly love
Nor should we think that God is more light than love Or more love
than light: Rather it is God himself who is light; and it is God himself who is
also love:
The
true of other descriptions of God $ character; such as that in
Exodus 34.6-7:
The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD,
God merciful and gracious
slow
anger; and abounding
steadfast
You
every
same
love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands
forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin; but who will by no means
ear the
guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the
children $ children; to the third and the fourth generation.
We would not want t0 say that these attributes are only characteristic of some
part of God_
but rather that they are characteristic of God himself and
therefore characteristic of all of God.
These considerations indicate that we should not think of God as some kind of
collection of various attributes added
together as in figure 11:2.
boiNG
COLLECTON OF 'Ttributgs
addcdtogothoR
Fiqute 42
Nor should we think of the attributes of God as something external
God'$ real
or real self;
something added on tO who God really is_
after
the
of figure 113
from
being
analogy
ATTRIBUTES
ARE NOT ADDITIONS
HIS RCRL BEING
Fiugte43
Rather;
we muSt remember that God's whole being includes all of his
attributes: he is entirely loving; entirely merciful, entirely just, and s0 forth:
Every attribute of God that we find in Scripture is true of all of God's being
and we therefore can say that
attribute of God also qualifies
Olher
attribute:
Figure 11.4 may be helpful in
understanding this doctrine of God's unity: In
the diagram; let us assume that the horizontal lines represent the attribute of
love, and that the vertical lines represent the aspect of God $ justice_
LOVE AND JUSTICE
Fiuute 44
Furthermore, let US understand the
diagonal lines going from upper left to
lower right as
representing God*s holiness and the diagonal lines going from
upper right t0 lower left as representing God $ wisdom; as in figure 1L.5.
LOVE, JUSTICE, HOLINESS, AND WISDOM
Fiuute 4.5
We could of course go on with different sorts of lines for each of the different
attributes of God:
But it should be clear that each attribute is simply
way of
describing
one aspect of God's total character 01
God himself is
unity;
every
every
being:
unified and completely integrated whole person who is infinitely perfect in
all of these attributes_
Why then does Scripture speak of these different attributes of God? It is
probably because we are unable to grasp all of God $ character at one time
and we need to learn of it from different perspectives over
period of time.
Yet these perspectives should never be set in opposition tO one another; for
they are just different ways of
at the totality of God's character:
In terms of practical application; this means that we should never think; for
example
that God is
loving God at one point in history and
just Or
wrathful God at another point in history: He is the same God always, and
everything he says Or does is fully consistent with all his attributes_
It is not
accurate
say, as some have said, that God is
God of justice in the Old
Testament and
God of love in the New Testament God is and always has
been infinitely just and infinitely
as well; and everything he does in the
Old Testament as well as the
Testament is completely consistent with
both of those attributes_
Now
is true that some actions of God show certain of his attributes more
prominently. Creation demonstrates his power and wisdom, the atonement
demonstrates his love and justice_
and the radiance of heaven demonstrates
his glory and beauty: But all of these in some way 0r other also demonstrate
his knowledge and holiness and mercy and truthfulness and patience and
sovereignty; and s0 forth: It would be difficult indeed t0 find some attribute of
God that is not reflected at least to some degree in any one of his acts of
redemption.
This is due t0 the fact mentioned above: God
unity and
everything he does is an act of the whole person of God
Moreover; the doctrine of the unity of God should caution us against
attempting t0 single out any one attribute of God as more important than all
the others_
At various times people have attempted
see God's holiness_
his love, or his self-existence_
his righteousness
or" some other attribute as
the most important attribute of his being:
But all such attempts seem to
misconceive of God as
combination of various parts_
with some parts being
somehow larger or more influential than others _
Furthermore, it is hard
understand exactly what "most important" might mean
Does
mean that
there are some actions of God that are not fully consistent with some of his
other attributes? That there are
SUME
attributes that God somehow sets aside
at times in order
act in ways
slightly contrary tO those attributes? Certainly
we cannot maintain either of these views
for that would mean that God is
inconsistent with his own character Or that he
changes and becomes
looking -
loving
New
something different from what he was previously: Rather; when we see all the
attributes aS merely various aspects of the total character of God, then such
question becomes quite unnecessary and we discover that there is no attribute
that can be singled out as more important: It is God himself in his whole
who is supremely important; and it is God himself in his whole being whom
we are t0 seek t0 know and [0 love.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
As you think of God's independence, unchangeableness_
eternity,
omnipresence
and unity; can yOu see some faint reflections of these five
incommunicable attributes in yourself as God created YOu t0 be? What
would
mean t0 strive [0 become more like God in these areas? At what
point would
be wrong
even want to be like God in each of these
areas because
would be
attempting
to usurp his unique role as Creator
and Lord?
Using each of these five incommunicable attributes, explain how we
be more like God in heaven than we are nOw, and also how we will for
all eternity be unlike God in each of these five areas
Explain how each aspect of the doctrine of God's independence makes
you feel emotionally
Does this doctrine have
positive 0r
negative
effect on your spiritual life? Explain why
Explain how the doctrine of God'$ immutability or unchangeableness
helps to answer the following questions:
we be able t0 do
good
job of bringing up children in such an evil world as we have today? Is it
possible to have the same close fellowship with God that people had
during biblical
times? What can we think or do [0 make Bible stories
seem more real
and less removed from 0ur present life? Do you think
that God is less willing to answer prayer today than he was in Bible
times?
If you sin against God today, when would it start bringing SOrTow to
God $ heart? When would
bringing SOrrow t0 God's heart? Does
this reflection help you understand why God's character requires that he
punish sin? Why did God have t0 send his Son to bear the punishment
for sin instead of simply forgetting about sin and welcoming sinners into
heaven without having given the punishment for sin to anyone? Does
God now think of your sins as forgiven Or as
unforgiven sins?
If you
praise t0 God today; when will the sound of that praise cease
being present in God's consciousness and bringing delight to his heart?
Do songs of praise tO God have any ultimate meaning? What about
in him hour by hour or obeying him
throughout each day?
Is control over the use of your time

individually as we sing_

however; for it makes us realize that when we finally see God in all his glory

ourselves lost

Chapter 12
The Character of God: "Communicable"
Attributes
(Part 1)
How is God like us in his being and in mental and moral
attributes?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In this chaptel
consider the attributes of God that are
communicable;
more shared with us than those mentioned in the previous chapter: It must be
remembered that this division into "incommunicable'
and
communicable
not an absolute division and there
some room for difference of opinion
concerning which attributes should fit into which categories_
The list of
attributes here put in the category
communicable'
common one, but
understanding the definition of each attribute
more important than being
able
categorize them in exactly the way presented in this book:
Furthermore, any list of God' $ attributes must be based on some
understanding of how finely one wishes
make distinctions between various
aspects of God $ character: Are God'$
goodness and love two attributes or
one? What about knowledge and wisdom; or spirituality and invisibility? In
this chapter; each of these attributes is treated separately, and the result is _
rather long list of various attributes. Yet in severa
cases it would not make
much difference if someone were
[0 treat these
as various aspects of the
same attribute. If we remember that it is the entire and wholly integrated
person of God about whom we are talking_
will be apparent that the division
into various attributes is not
matter of great doctrinal significance but is
something that must be based 0n one'$
judgment concerning the most
effective way
present the biblical material
This chapter divides God $
communicable'
attributes into five major
categories_
with individual attributes listed under each category as follows:
Attributes
Describing God*$ Being
Spirituality
pairs
Invisibility
B. Mental Attributes
3. Knowledge (or Omniscience)
Wisdom
Truthfulness (and Faithfulness)
Moral Attributes
Goodness
Love
Mercy (Grace, Patience)
Holiness
Peace (or Order)
Righteousness (or Justice)
12. Jealousy
Wrath
Attributes of Purpose
14. Will
Freedom
16. Omnipotence (or Power; and Sovereignty)
E. "Summary" Attributes
17. Perfection
18. 9 Blessedness
19. Beauty
20. Glory
Because God $ communicable attributes are
be imitated in our lives,
each
of these sections will include
short explanation of the way in which the
attribute in question is to be imitated by US.
Attrilute: Describing Gcll - Dieing
1. Spirituality. People have often wondered_
what is God made 0f
[s he
made of flesh and blood like ourselves? Certainly not What then is the
material that forms his being? Is God made of matter at all? Or is God pure
energy? Or is he in some sense pure thought?
The answer of Scripture is that God is none of these. Rather;
read that
"God is spirit'
(John 4.24)
This statement is
spoken by Jesus in the context
discussion with the woman at the well in Samaria. The discussion is
about the location where people should worship God
and Jesus is
telling her
that true
worship of God does not require that one be present either in
Jerusalem or in Samaria (John 4.21), for tnue worship has to do not with
physical location but with one's innel
spiritual
condition.
because
"God is spirit" and this apparently signifies that God is in nO way limited t0 a
location.
Thus _
should not think of God as having size or dimensions, even infinite
ones (see the discussion on God $ omnipresence
the previous chapter). We
should not think of God s existence as spirit as
meaning that God is infinitely
for example; for it is not part of God but all of God that is in every
point of space (see Ps. 139.7-10). Nor should we think that God's existence
as spirit means that God is infinitely small, for nO place in the universe can
surround him or contain him (see
Kings 8.27). Thus
God*s being cannot be
rightly thought of in terms of space; however we may understand his
existence as
spirit:
We also find that God forbids his people
think of his very being as similar
anything else in the physical creation. We read in the Ten Commandments:
You shall not make for yourself
graven image
or any likeness of
anything that is
heaven above, Or that is in the earth beneath;, Or that
is in the water under the earth;
shall not bow down t0 them
serve them; for
the LORD your God am
jealous God,
the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth
generation of those who hate me_
but showing steadfast love to
thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments (Ex
20.4-6)
This
spatial
large,
You
visiting
The creation language in this commandment
heaven above, or
earth
beneath, or

reminder that God's being, his
essential mode of existence, is different from everything that he has created_
To think of his being in terms of
anything else in the created universe is to
misrepresent him, tO
him, to think of him as less than he really is. To
make
graven (Or
carved"
sculptured"
image of God as
golden calf;
for example; may have been an attempt t0 portray God as
God who is strong
and full of life (like
calf); but to say that God was like
calf was
horribly
false statement about God's knowledge_
wisdom, love, mercy, omnipresence_
eternity; independence, holiness, righteousness, justice, and so forth. Indeed_
while we must say that God has made all creation s0 that each part of it
reflects something of his Own character;
we must also nOw affirm that t0
picture God as existing
form Or mode of being that is like anything else in
creation is [0 think of God in
horribly misleading and dishonoring way:
This
why God $ jealousy is given as the reason for the prohibition against
making images of him:
for
the LORD your God am
jealous God
(Ex
20.5). God is jealous to protect his own honor: He eagerly seeks for people to
think of him as he is and to worship him for all his excellence, and he is
angered when his glory is diminished or his character is falsely represented
(cf. Deut 4.23-24, where God $ intense jealousy for his own honor is again
given as the reason for _
prohibition against making any images of him).
Thus _
God does not have
physical body, nor is he made of any kind of
matter like much of the rest of creation_
Furthermore, God is not merely
energy Or thought or some other element of creation. He is also not like vapor
steam
air or space, all of which are created things: God $ being is nOt
like any of these _
God'$ being is nOt even exactly like our own spirits_
these are created
that apparently are able to exist only in one place in
one time.
Instead of all these ideas of God
we muSt say that God is spirit Whatever
this means, it is
kind of existence that is unlike
anything else in creation. It
kind of existence that is far superior t0 all Our material existence:
We
might say that God is "pure being'
"the fullness or essence of being:
Furthermore, this kind of existence is nOt less real or less desirable than our
own existence.
Rather; it is more real and more desirable than the material
and immaterial existence of all creation.
Before there was any creation, God
existed as spirit His Own being is SO very real
that it was able t0 cause
everything else to come into existence!
At this point we can define God 's spirituality: God $ spirituality means that
limit
things
God exists as
being that is not made of any matter; has no parts 0r
dimensions
is unable to be perceived by our bodily senses; and is more
excellent than any other kind of existence.
We may ask why God'$
this way: Why is God spirit? All that we can
say is that this is the greatest, most excellent way to bel This is
torm of
existence far superior t0 anything we know: It is amazing tO meditate on this
fact.
These considerations make uS wonder if God's spirituality should perhaps be
called an "incommunicable'
attribute: To do s0 would indeed be appropriate
in some ways, since God $
being is so different from ours_
Nevertheless_
the
fact remains that God has given uS spirits in which we worship him (John
4.24;
Cor: 14.14; Phil. 3.3), in which we are united with the Lord's spirit
Cor: 6.17), with which the Holy Spirit joins t0 bear witness tO our adoption in
God's family (Rom: &.16), and in which we pass into the Lord $ presence
when we die (Luke 23.46; Eccl. 12:7; Heb. 12.23; cf: Phil. 1.23-24).
Therefore there is clearly some communication from God to uS of
spiritual
nature that is
something like his own nature, though certainly not in all
respects. For this reason it also seems appropriate
think of God $
spirituality as
communicable attribute.
2. Invisibility: Related to God $ spirituality is the fact that God is invisible:
Yet we also must
of the visible ways in which God manifests himself:
God's invisibility can be defined as follows-
God $ invisibility means that
God $ total essence, all of his spiritual being; will never be able t0 be seen by
uS, yet God still shows himself to uS through visible, created
passages
of the fact that God is not able to be seen:
No one has
ever seen God" (John 1.18). Jesus says_
"Not that any one has seen the Father
except him who is from God; he has seen the Father" (John 6.46). Paul gives
the following words of praise:
To the
of ages, immortal, invisible, the
only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever: Amen'
(1 Tim: 1:17). He
speaks of God as one
who alone has
immortality and dwells in
unapproachable light; whom no man has ever seen Or
see"
(1 Tim. 6.16).
John says,
No man has ever seen God"
John 4.12).
We must remember that these passages were all written after events in
Scripture where people saw some outward manifestation of God. For
example_
early in Scripture we read,
Thus the LORD used [0 speak [0
Moses face t0 face, as
man
to his friend" (Ex. 33.11). Yet God told
Moses,
You cannot see my face; for man shall not see me and live
(Ex.
being
speak
things-
Many
speak
King
very
speaks
33.20).
Nevertheless, God caused his glory to pass by Moses while he hid
Moses in
cleft of the rock; and then God let Moses see his back after he had
passed by, but said,
my face shall not be seen
(Ex 33.21-23). This
sequence of verses and others like it in the Old Testament indicate that there
was
sense in
which God could not be seen at all, but that there was also
SUME
ourward tom
manifestation of God which at least in part was able t0
be seen by man:
It is right; therefore; to say that although
total essence will never be
able t0 be seen by 4S, nevertheless,
God
shows something of himself to
us through visible, created
This happens in
variety of ways:
If we are t0 think of God
we muSt
think of him somehow: God understands
this and gives us hundreds of different analogies taken
human lives
or from the creative world. -
This
diversity of analogies from all parts of
creation reminds US that we should not focus overly much on any one of these
analogies. Yet if we do not focus exclusively on any one of these
analogies_
all of them help t0 reveal God t0 us in
somewhat
visible'
way (cf: Gen:
1.27; Ps. 19.1; Rom. 1.20).
The Old Testament also records
number of theophanies_
theophany is
appearance of God
In these theophanies God took on various visible forms
to show himself to people
God appeared t0 Abraham (Gen. 18.1-33) , Jacob
(Gen. 32.28-30), the people of Israel (as
pillar of cloud by day and fire by
night: Ex: 13.21-22), the elders of Israel (Ex: 24.9-11), Manoah and his wife
(Judg: 13.21-22), Isaiah (Isa. 6.1), and others_
A much greater visible manifestation of God than these Old Testament
theophanies was found in the person of Jesus Christ himself. He could say;
"He who has seen me has seen the Father"' (John 14.9). And John contrasts
the fact that no one has ever seen God with the fact that God'
only Son has
made him known t0 uS:
No one has ever seen God; the only begotten God,
who is in the bosom of the Father; he has made him known'
(John 1.18,
author $ translation) . Furthermore, Jesus is "the image of the invisible God"
(Col. 1:15), and is "the bright radiance of the glory of God" and
"the exacr
representation of his nature
(Heb
1.3 author
translation) . Thus
in the
person of Jesus we have
unique visible manifestation of God in the New
Testament that was not available t0 believers who saw theophanies in the Old
Testament:
But how will we see God in heaven? We will never be able t0 see or know all
of God
for "his greatness
unsearchable-

Tim_

trom
OI
huge
1.17; 6.16;
John 4.12, which were mentioned above) And we will not be
able t0 see
least with 0ur physical eyes
the spiritual being of God
Nevertheless, Scripture says that we will see God himself: Jesus says,
"Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God" (Matt: 5.8). We will be
able t0 see the human nature of Jesus, of course (Rev: 1:7). But it is not clear
in exactly what sense
will be able [0
see
the Father and the Holy Spirit,
or the divine nature of God the Son (cf. Rev: 1.4; 4.2-3,5; 5.6). Perhaps the
nature of this
will not be known t0 US until we reach heaven:
Although what we see will not be an exhaustive vision of God
it will be
completely true and clear and real vision of God. We shall see "face t0 face'
13.12) and
we shall see him as he is" ( 1 John 3.2). The most
remarkable description of the open, close fellowship with God that we shall
experience is seen in the fact that in the heavenly city "the throne of God and
of the Lamb shall be in
and his servants shall worship
they shall see
his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads
(Rev 22.3-4)
When we realize that God is the perfection of all that we long for or desire_
that he is the summation of
everything beautiful or desirable, then we realize
that the greatest joy of the life t0 come will be that we
shall see his face
This seeing of God "face to face
has been called the beatific vision, meaning
"the vision that makes Us blessed or happy"
beatific'
from two Latin
words_
beatus; "blessed;'
and facere,"to make-
To look at God changes us
and makes us like him: "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is
John 3.2; cf:
Cor: 3.18). This vision of God will be the consummation of
knowing God and will give us full delight and joy for all eternity: "in your
presence there is fulness 0f
in your right hand are pleasures for evermore
(Ps. 16.11).
Mental Attribulcs
3. Knowledge (Omniscience) God $ knowledge may be defined as follows:
God fully knows himself and all things actual and possible in one simple and
eternal act:
Elihu says that God is the one "who is perfect in knowledge
(Job 37:16) , and
John says that God
everything
(1 John 3.20). The quality of
knowing everything
called omniscience_
because God knows
everything; he is said to be omniscient (that is_
"all-
~knowing"
The definition given above explains omniscience in more detail
Lt says
that God fully knows himself: This is an
fact since God's own
is infinite Or unlimited. Of course, only he who is infinite can fully know
seeing
Cor:
hiin;
joy;
"knows
and

being
himself in every detail. This fact is implied by Paul when he says,
For the
Spirit searches everything even the depths of God. For what person knows
man
thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one
comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God" (1 Cor: 2:10-11)
This idea is also suggested by John's statement that "God is light and in him
is no darkness at all"
John 1.5). In this context "light" has
suggestion of
both moral purity and full
knowledge .
Or awareness. If there is
no darkness ar
all" in God
but he is entirely "light,
then God is himself both entirely holy
and also entirely filled with self-knowledge
The definition also says that God knows "all
actual:
This means all
things that exist and all things that happen. This applies
creation_
tor God is
the one before whom
no creature is hidden_
but all are open and laid bare
the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Heb. 4.13; cf: 2 Chron. 16.9; Job
28.24; Matt: 10.29-30)_
God also knows the future
for he is the one who can
say;
am God
and there is none like me,
declaring the end from the
beginning and from ancient times
not yet done
(Isa_
46.9-10; cf:
42.8-9 and frequent passages in the Old Testament prophets). He knows the
tiny details of every one of our lives_
for Jesus tells uS
Your Father knows
what yOu need before YOu ask
(Matt_ 6.8) , and; "Even the hairs of your
head are all numbered'
(Matt: 10.30)
In Psalm 139 David reflects on the amazing detail of God's knowledge of our
lives
He knows
actions and thoughts:
0 LORD _
have searched me
and known me! You know when
sit down and when
rise up; YOu discern
my thoughts from afar" (Ps. 139.1-2). He knows the words we will say before
they are spoken: "Even before
word is on my tongue; lo,
0 LORD _
you know
it altogether" (Ps. 139.4). And he knows all the days of our lives even before
we are bom:
Your eyes beheld my unformed substance; in your book were
written_
every one of them, the days that were formed for me
when as yet
there was none of them"
(Ps. 139.16).
The definition of God 's knowledge given above also specifies that God knows
"all things possible:
This is because
there are some instances in Scripture
where God gives information about events that might happen but that do not
actually come t0 pass. For example, when David was fleeing from Saul he
rescued the city of Keilah from the Philistines and then stayed for
time at
Keilah: He decided to ask God whether Saul would come t0 Keilah to attack
him and, if Saul came,
whether the men of Keilah would surrender him into
Saul $ hand
David said:
things
things
him"
or
Vuu
Will Saul come down,
your servant has heard? 0 LORD_
the God
of Israel,
beseech you; tell your servant
And the LORD said, "He
will come down
Then said David
"Will the men of Keilah surrender
me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They
will surrender YOu_
Then David and his men, who were about six
hundred_
arose and departed from Keilah; and they went wherever
could g0.
When Saul was told that David had escaped from
Keilah; he gave up the expedition. (1 Sam: 23.11-13)
Similarly, Jesus could state that Tyre and Sidon would have repented if Jesus
own miracles had been done there in former days:
Woe
you; Chorazin!
woe to YOu; Bethsaida)
for if the mighty works done in you had been done in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ag0 in sackcloth and ashes"
(Matt: 11.21). Similarly; he says, "And YOu; Capernaum; will you be exalted
heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades_
For if the mighty works done
in you had been done in Sodom;
would have remained
this day" (Matt:
11.23; cf:
Kings 13.19,
where Elisha tells what would have happened if
King Joash had struck the ground five Or six times with the arrows).
The fact that God knows all things possible can also be deduced from God'$
full knowledge of himself: If God fully knows himself; he knows everything
he is able t0 do; which includes all
that are possible. This fact is indeed
amazing
God has made an incredibly complex and varied universe. But there
are thousands upon thousands of other variations or kinds of
thar God
could have created but did not: God'$ infinite knowledge includes detailed
knowledge of what each of those other possible creations would have been
like and what would have happened
each of them! "Such knowledge is too
wonderful fOr me; it is high;
cannot attain it" (Ps. 139.6). "For as the
heavens are
higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and
my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isa. 55.9).
Our definition of God's knowledge speaks of God knowing everything
one
simple act:
Here
the word simple is used in the sense
nOr divided
into parts_
This means that God is always fully aware of
everything: If he
should wish to tell us the number of grains of sand on the seashore or the
number of stars in the sky; he would not have to count them all quickly like
some kind of giant computer; nor would he have t0 call the number t0 mind
because
Wds
something he had not thought about for
time
Rather; he
always knows all things at once_
All of these facts and all other things that he
knows are always fully present in his consciousness
He does not have t0
reasom
conclusions 0F
ponder carefully before he answers, for he knows the
end from the beginning_
and he never learns and never forgets anything (cf.
they
unrl
things "
things =
again E
Ps. 90.4; 2 Peter 3.8; and the verses cited above on God $ perfect knowledge).
Every bit of God's knowledge is always fully present in his consciousness;
neven
grows dim or fades into his nonconscious memory Finally; the
definition talks about God's
knowledge
as not only
simple act but also an
eternal act:
This means that God's knowledge never changes Or grows. If he
were ever [0 learn something new; he would not have been omniscient
beforehand_
Thus
from all eternity God has known all
that would
happen and all
that he would do.
Someone may object that God promises to forget our sins. For example
says
will not remember your sins" (Isa. 43.25).
Yet passages like this can
certainly be understood to mean that God will never
let the knowledge
of these sins play any part in the way he relates t0 us: he will "forger" them in
his relationship
Another objection to the biblical teaching about God'$
omniscience has been brought from Jeremiah 7.31; 19.5; and 31.35
where
God refers t0 the horrible practices of parents who burn t0 death their Own
children
the sacrificial
of the pagan god Baal, and says, "which
did
not command;
nor did it come into my mind" (Jer: 7.31). Does this mean that
before the time of Jeremiah God had never thought of the possibility that
parents
sacrifice their own children? Certainly nOt; for that very
practice had occurred
century earlier in the reigns of Ahaz (2
16.3)
and Hoshea (2
17.17), and God himself had forbidden the practice
eight hundred years earlier under Moses (Lev: 18.21). The verses
Jeremiah
are probably better translated quite literally;
nor did
enter into my hearr"
(so KJV ar Jer 7.31
and the literal translation in the NASB mg
~the Hebrew
word is leb; most frequently translated "hearr" -
giving the sense,
nor did
wish for it; desire it; think of it in
positive way:"
Another difficulty that arises in this connection is the question of the
relationship between God's knowledge of everything that will happen in the
and the reality and degree of freedom we have in our actions. If God
knows
everything that will happen_
how can Our choices be at all "free"
this difficulty has loomed s0
that some theologians have concluded
that God does not know all of the future. They have said that God does not
know
that cannot (in their opinion) be known; such as the free acts of
people that have not yet occurred (sometimes the phrase used is the
contingent acts of free moral agents_
where
contingent" means
possible
but not centain'
But such
position
unsatisfactory because
essentially
denies God*s knowledge of the future of human history
any point in time
and thus is inconsistent with the passages cited above about God's knowledge
of the future and with dozens of other Old Testament prophetic passages

fact,
Large

where God

How then are
we t0 resolve this difficulty? Although this question will be
treated in much more detail in chapter 16 on God's providence
may be
helpful at this point tO note the suggestion of Augustine
who said that God
has given us "reasonable self-determination.
His statement does not involve
the terms free or freedom, for these terms are exceptionally difficult to define
in any way that satisfactorily accounts for God's complete knowledge of
events. But this statement does affirm what is important tO US and what
we sense [0 be true in our Own
experience, that our choices and decisions are
reasonable_
That
we think about what t0 do, consciously decide what we
will do_
and then we follow the course of action that we have chosen:
Augustine
statement also says that we have
self-determination
This is
simply
affirming that our choices really do determine what will happen: It is
not as if events occur regardless of what we decide or do, but rather that
occur because of what we decide and do. No attempt
made in this statement
define the sense in which we are "free
not
but that is not the
really important issue
for US, it is important that we
choose, and act,
and that these thoughts_
choices_
and actions are real and actually have eternal
significance. If God knows all 0ur thoughts,
words_
and actions
before
they occur; then there must be some sense in which our choices are not
absolutely free. But further definition of this issue
better left until
can be
treated more fully in chapter 16.
Wisdom:
God $ wisdom means that God always chooses the best goals and
the best means
those goals. This definition goes beyond the idea of God
knowing all things and specifies that God's decisions about what he will do
are
always wise decisions: that is_
always will bring about the best results
(from God'$ ultimate perspective), and they will bring about those results
through the best possible means.
Scripture affirms God's wisdom in general
several places_
He is called "the
only wise God" (Rom: 16.27). Job says that God "is wise in heart" (Job 9.4),
and "With him are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding'
(Job 12.13). God's wisdom is seen specifically in creation. The psalmist
exclaims,
0 LORD_
how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made
them all; the earth
of Your creatures" (Ps. 104.24). As God created the
universe_
it was perfectly suited t0
him glory, both in its day-by-day
processes and in the goals for which he created it Even now; while we still
see the effects of sin and the curse on the natural world
should be amazed
at how harmonious and intricate God'$ creation is_
great
future"
they
free
think;
long
they
tull
bring
God'$s wisdom
also seen in his great plan of redemption. Christ is "the
wisdom of God" to those who are called (1 Cor: 1:24,30) , even though the
word of the cross
"foolishness'
to those who reject it and think themselves
be wise in this world (1 Cor: 1.18-20).
Yer even this
reflection of God $
wise plan:
For since, in the wisdom of God_
the world did not know God
through wisdom
pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save
those who believe_
God chose what is foolish in the world t0 shame the
wise
so that no human being might boast in the presence of God" (1 Cor:
1:21,27,29).
Paul knows that what we nOw think of as the "simple
gospel
message_
understandable even to the very young; reflects an amazing plan of God,
which in its depths of wisdom surpasses anything man could ever have
imagined.
At the end of eleven chapters of reflection on the wisdom of God $
plan of redemption, Paul bursts forth into spontaneous praise: "0 the depth of
the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his
judgments and how inscrutable his
(Rom: 11.33).
When Paul preaches the gospel
both to Jews and 0 Gentiles, and
become
unified in the one body of Christ (Eph: 3.6), the incredible
mystery
that was
"hidden for ages in God who created all things" (Eph. 3.9) is plain for all to
see, namely; that in Christ such totally diverse people become united_
When
groups S0 different racially and culturally become members of the one body
of Christ, then God's purpose is fulfilled, "that through the church the
manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and
powers in the heavenly places
(Eph 3.10).
Today this means that God's wisdom is shown even to angels and demons
principalities and powers'
when people from different racial and cultural
backgrounds are united in Christ in the church: If the Christian church is
faithful to God $ wise plan, it will be always in the forefront in breaking down
racial and social barriers in societies around the world; and will thus be
visible manifestation of God $ amazingly wise plan t0
great unity Out of
great diversity and thereby to cause all creation to honor him:
God's wisdom
also shown in Our individual
lives_
We know that God
works all
together for
for those who love him, who are called
according
t0 his purpose
(Rom: &.28
author's translation).
Here Paul affirms
that God does work wisely in all the
that come into our lives
and that
through all these
he advances US (Oward the
of conformity t0 the
image of Christ (Rom. 8.29).

he has for our lives, namely; that we might be like Christ and
thereby bring glory to him: Such confidence enabled Paul to accept his "thorn
in the flesh" (2 Cor: 12.7) as something that; though painful, God in his
wisdom had chosen not tO remove (2 Cor: 12.8-10).
Every day of our lives
we may
quiet our discouragement with the comfort
that comes from the
knowledge of God s infinite wisdom: if we are his
children,
can know that he is

even
today;

We can ask God
confidently for wisdom when we need it, for he promises in his Word, "If any
of you lacks wisdom; let him ask God_
who gives to all men generously and
without reproaching_
and it will be given him"
(James 1.5). This wisdom, Or
skill in
life
pleasing to God, comes primarily from reading and
obeying his Word: "The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the
simple" (Ps. 19.7; cf: Deut. 46-8).
"The fear of the LORD is the
beginning of wisdom" (Ps: 11:10; Prov: 9.10; cf
Prov: 1:7), because if we fear
dishonoring God or displeasing him; and if we
fear his fatherly discipline_
then we will have the motivation that makes uS
want to follow his ways and live
according-
his wise commands_
Furthermore, the possession of wisdom from God will result not in pride but
humility (Prov 11:2; James 3.13), not in arrogance but in
gentle and
peaceful spirit (James 3.14-18). The person who is wise according
God $
standards will continually walk in dependence on the Lord and with
desire
[0 exalt him:
Yet we must also remember that God $ wisdom is not entirely communicable:
we can never fully share God's wisdom (Rom: 1:33) . In practical terms
this
means that there will frequently be times in this life when we will not be able
tO understand why God allowed something
happen. Then we have simply
tO trust him and g0 on
his wise commands for our lives: " [herefore
let those who suffer
according 5
to God $ will do right and entrust their souls to
faithful Creator'
Peter 4.19; cf. Deut: 29.29; Prov: 3.5-6). God
infinitely wise and we are not, and ir pleases him when we have faith t0 tTUSC
his wisdom even when we do not understand what he
doing:
[ruthfulness (and Faithfulness). God $ truthfulness means that he is the
true God, and that all his knowledge and words are both true and the final
standard of truth:
The term veracity, which means "truthfulness
or "reliability;
has sometimes
goal -
working
living
obeying
been used as
synonym for God's truthfulness.
The first
of this definition indicates that the God revealed in Scripture is
the true
real God and that all other so-called
are idols_
"The LORD is
the true God; he is the living God and the
everlasting
The
who
did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from
under the heavens
(Jer: 10.10-11). Jesus says t0 his Father;
And this is
eternal life , that .
know YOu the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you
have sent" (John 17.3; cf:
John 5.20).
We might ask what it means to be the true God as opposed to other
who are not God
Ic must mean that God in his own
being Or character is the
one who fully conforms t0 the idea of what God should be
namely,
being
who is
infinitely perfect in power; in wisdom; in goodness_
in lordship over
time and space, and s0 forth:
But we may further ask; whose idea of God is
this? What idea of God muSt one conform [0 in order [0 be the true God?
At this point our train of thought becomes somewhat circular; fOr we must not
say that
being must conform to our idea of what God should be like in order
be the true God! We are mere creatures=
We cannor define what the true
God must be
So we must say that it is God himself who has the only
perfect idea of what the true God should be like_
And he himself is the true
God because in his
and character he perfectly conforms to his own idea
of what the true God should be_
In addition_
he has implanted in our minds
reflection of his own
Idea of what the true God muSt be
and this enables uS
recognize him as God.
The definition given above also affirms that all of God*s knowledge is true
and is the final standard of truth: Job tells uS that God is
perfect
knowledge"
(Job 37.16; see also the verses cited above under the discussion
of God*$ omniscience) To say that God knows all things and that his
knowledge is perfect is to say that he is never mistaken in his perception or
understanding of the world: all that he knows and thinks is true and is _
correct
understanding of the nature of reality: In
since God knows all
things infinitely well;
we can say that the standard of [rue knowledge is
conformity to God's knowledge. If we think the same thing God thinks about
anything in the universe_
we are
truthfully about it:
Our definition also affirms that God s words are both true and the final
standard of truth: [his means thar God
reliable and faithful in his words
With respect to his promises, God always does what he promises to do, and
we can
depend on him never to be unfaithful to his promises. Thus; he is
part
gods
King:
gods
they
beings
like:
being
facl
thinking
God of faithfulness" (Deut: 32.4). In fact; this specific aspect of God' $
truthfulness is sometimes viewed as
distinct attribute: God $ faithfulness
means that God
always do what he has said and fulfill what he has
promised (Num: 23.19; cf:
Sam. 7.28; Ps_
141.6; et al.) He can be relied
upon _
and he will never prove unfaithful to those who trust what he has said_
Indeed, the essence of true faith is taking God at his word and relying on him
do as he has promised.
addition t0 the fact that God is faithful to his promises, we must also affirm
that all of God'$ words about himself and about his creation completely
correspond to reality. That is
God always
truth when he speaks. He is
"the
unlying God" (Titus 1:2 , author
translation) , the God for whom it is
impossible to lie (Heb. 6.18), the God whose every word is perfectly "pure'
(Ps_
12.6), the one of whom it can be said, "Every word of God proves
(Prov: 30.5). God $ words are not simply true in the sense that -
conform
some standard of truthfulness outside of God. Rather; they are truth itself;
they are the final standard and definition of truth: So Jesus can say
the
Father;
Your word is truth:
(John 17:17). What was said about the
truthfulness of God's knowledge can also be said about God $ words
are based on his perfect knowledge and accurately reflect that perfect
knowledge: God $ words are
"truth" in the sense that they are the final
standard by which truthfulness is to be judged: whatever conforms t0 God $
own words is also true, and what fails t0 conform t0 his words is not true.
The truthfulness of God is also communicable in that we can in
imitale it
by striving to have true knowledge about God and about his world. In
we begin [0 think true thoughts about God and creation; thoughts that we
learn from Scripture and from allowing Scripture to guide Us in our
observation and interpretation of the natural world, we begin t0 think God 's
own thoughts after him! We can exclaim with the psalmist; "How precious t0
me are your thoughts_
0 God! How vast is the sum of them!" (Ps. 139.17).
This realization should encourage US in the pursuit of
knowledge
in all areas
of the natural and social sciences and the humanities_
Whatever the area of
our investigation; when we discover more truth about the nature of reality,
discover more of the truth that God already knows
In this sense we can
affirm that "all truth is God $
and rejoice whenever the learning or
discovery of this truth is used in ways pleasing to God_
Growth in knowledge
is pait of the process of `
becoming
more like God or
becoming creatures who
are more fully in God'$ image. Paul tells Us that we have put on the
new
nature;
which_
he says, "is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its
(Col: 3.10).
Will
speaks
tque"

part
fach,

creator"
sociery that is exceedingly careless with the truthfulness of spoken words,
we as God'$ children are t0 imitate our Creator and take great care to be sure
that our words are always truthful. "Do not lie t0 one another; seeing that yOu
have put off the old nature with its practices and have put on the new nature
(Col. 3.9-10). Again Paul admonishes_
'Therefore; putting away falsehood_
let every one speak the truth with his neighbor" (Eph: 4.25). In his Own
ministry; Paul says that he sought tO practice absolute truthfulness:
We have
renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways; we refuse t0 practice
Or [0
tamper with God $ word
but by the open statement of the truth we would
commend ourselves t0 every man'$ conscience in the sight of God"
Cor:
4.2).
God is pleased when his people put
devious talk" far from them (Prov
4.24) and speak with words that are acceptable not only in the sight of people
but also in the sight of the Lord himself (Ps. 19.14).
Furthermore
should imitate God'$ truthfulness in OuI own reaction t0
truth and falsehood. Like God
we should love truth and hate falsehood: The
commandment not [0 bear false witness
against
neighbor (Ex
20:16),
the other commandments,
requires not merely outward conformity but also
conformity in heart attitude:
One who
pleasing to God "speaks truth from
his heart" (Ps. 15.2), and strives to be like the righteous man who "hates
falsehood" (Prov 13.5). God commands his people through Zechariah;,
Do
not devise evil in your hearts
one
another; and love no false oath, for
all these things
hate, says the LORD
(Lech: &.17).
These commands are given because God himself loves truth and hates
falsehood:
~Lying lips are an abomination t0 the LORD_
but those who act
faithfully are his
delight" (Prov: 12.22; cE: Isa. 59.3-4). Falsehood and lying
come not from God but from Satan, who delights in falsehood:
When he lies _
he speaks according to his own nature
for he is
liar and the father of lies
(John 8.44). It is appropriate then that with "the cowardly; the faithless_
the
polluted" and the
murderers, fornicators_
sorcerers, [and] idolaters'
who are
found in "the lake that burns with fire and sulphur" far from the heavenly city;
are found also
all liars
(Rev: 21.8).
Thus, Scripture teaches us that lying is wrong not only because of the great
harm that comes
from it (and much more harm comes from lying than we
often realize) , but also for an even deeper and more profound reason: when
lie we dishonor God and diminish his glory; for we; as those created in
God's image and created for the purpose of reflecting God's glory
ouI
lives, are acting in
way that is contrary to God's Own character:

Goodness:
The goodness of God means that God is the final standard of
good, and that all that God is and does
worthy of approval
In this definition we find
situation similar (0 the one we faced in
God as the true God. Here;
can be understood t0 mean "worthy of
approval,
but we have not answered the question, approval by whom? In one
sense, we can say that anything that is truly good should be worthy of
approval by uS_
But in
more ultimate sense_
we are not free to decide by
ourselves what is worthy of approval
and what is not: Ultimately; therefore;
God's being and actions are perfectly worthy
his own
approval. He
therefore the final standard of good. Jesus implies this when he says, "No one
but God alone" (Luke 18.19). The Psalms frequently affirm that "the
LORD is
(Ps. 100.5) or exclaim; "0 give thanks t0 the LORD, for he is
(Pss. 106:1; 107:1; et al.). David encourages S
"0 taste and see that
the LORD is
good! " (Ps. 34.8).
But if God is himself good and therefore the ultimate standard of good, then
we have
definition of the
that will
greatly help us in the
study of ethics and aesthetics.
What is
Good"
what God
approves:
We may ask then, why is what God approves
We must
answer; "Because he approves it.
That is to say; there
no higher standard of
goodness than God *s Own character and his approval of whatever is consistent
with that character: Nonetheless,
God has given 4S some reflection of his own
sense of goodness
that when we evaluate
things in the way God created us
evaluate them; we will also approve what God approves and delight in
things in which he delights.
Our definition also states that all that God does is worthy of approval. We see
evidence of this in the creation narrative:
And God saw everything that he
had made, and behold, it was very good
(Gen. 1.31). The psalmist connects
the goodness of God with the goodness of his actions_
You are
and you
do good; teach me YOur statutes'
(Ps. 119.68). Psalm 104 is an excellent
example of praise t0 God for his
goodness in creation, while many Psalms,
such as Psalms 106 and 107, give thanks to God for his
goodness in all his
actions toward his people_
And Paul encourages US t0 discover in practice
how God'$ will for our lives is "good and acceptable and perfect" (Rom.
12.2).
Scripture also tells us that God is the source of all good in the world: "Every
good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
Father of lights with whom there is no variation O shadow due t0 change'
(James 1:17; cf. Ps. 145.9; Acts 14.17). Moreover; God does only
things
defining
good"
guod
go0d"
good"
meaning
good"

goud?
good
good
for his children. We read,
does the LORD withhold from those
who walk uprightly" (Ps. 84:11). And in the same context in which Paul
assures US that "in everything God works for good with those who love him'
(Rom: &.28), he also says_
~He who did not spare his own Son but gave him
up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him?" (Rom. 8.32).
Much
more than an earthly father; our heavenly Father will
give good things [O
those who ask him" (Matt: 7:11), and even his discipline is
manifestation of
his love and is for our
good (Heb. 12:10). This knowledge of God's great
goodness should encourage US t0
give thanks in all circumstances'
(1 Thess_
5.18).
In imitation of this communicable attribute;
should ourselves do
(thac is,
we should do what God approves) and thereby imitate the goodness
of our heavenly Father: Paul writes, "So then,
have opportunity; let 4S
do good to all men; and especially to those who are of the household of faith"
(Gal: 6.10; cf: Luke 6.27,33-35;
Tim. 3.17). Moreover; when we realize
that God is the definition and source of all good,
realize that God
himself is the ultimate good that we seek We will say with the psalmist;
"Whom have
in heaven but you? And there is
upon earth that
desire besides you:
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of
my heart and my portion for ever" (Ps. 73.25-26; cf: 16.11; 42.1-2).
God'$ goodness
closely related to several other characteristics of his nature,
among them love, mercy, patience, and grace. Sometimes these are
considered separate attributes and are treated individually At other times
these are considered part of God $ goodness and are treated as various aspects
of God $ goodness
In this chapter
will treat love as
separate attribute
since
is s0 prominent in Scripture_
The other three characteristics (mercy;
patience,
and grace); while also prominent in Scripture; will be treated
together as aspects of God's goodness to individuals in specific situations_
Thus, God'$ mercy is his goodness toward those
distress, his grace is his
goodness toward those who deserve only punishment; and his patience is his
goodness toward those who continue t0 sin over
period of time (see below;
section C
on mercy; patience
and grace):
7. Love: God '$ love means that God eternally gives of himself to others:
This definition understands love as self-giving for the benefit of others_
This
attribute of God shows that it is part of his nature t0 give of himself in order
about blessing
good for others_
John tells us that "God is love"
John 4.8). We see evidence that this
good
thing
good
will
nothing
bring
attribute of God was active even before creation among the members of the
Trinity. Jesus speaks t0 his Father of
'my glory which you have given me in
love for me before the foundation of the world" (John 17.24), thus
indicating that there was love and
giving of honor from the Father to the
Son from all eternity. It continues at the present time
for we read,
The
Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand" (John 3.35).
This love is also reciprocal, for Jesus says;
do as the Father has
commanded me, SO that the world may know that
love the Father" (John
14.31). The love between the Father and the Son also presumably
characterizes their relationship with the Holy Spirit, even though it is not
explicitly mentioned_
This eternal love of the Father for the Son
the Son for
the Father; and of both for the Holy Spirit makes heaven
world of love and
joy because each person of the Trinity seeks to bring joy and happiness tO the
other [WO
The self-giving that characterizes the Trinity finds clear expression in God $
relationship to mankind_
and especially t0 sinful men.
In this is love_
not that
we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for
sins
John 4.10, author"
translation). Paul writes; "God shows his love
for US in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us" (Rom: 5.8). John
also writes_
"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son_
that
whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3.16)
Paul also speaks of "the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me
(Gal. 2.20) , thus showing an awareness of the directly personal application of
Christ'$ love tO individual sinners It should cause US great joy tO know that it
is the purpose of God the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit [0 give of themselves
[0 uS
bring 4S true joy and happiness It is God'
nature t0 act that way
toward those upon whom he has set his love_
and he will continue [0 act that
way toward uS for all eternity:
We imitate this communicable attribute of God, first by loving God in return,
and second by
others
imitation of the way God loves them_
All our
obligations to God can be summarized in this: "You shall love the Lord your
God with all your heart; and with all your soul, and with all your mind
You shall love your neighbor as yourself
(Matt: 22.37-38). If we love God,
we Will
his commandments
John 5.3) and thus do what is
pleasing to
him_
We will love God, not the world
John 2.15), and we will do all this
because he first loved us (1 John 4.19).
It is one of the most amazing facts in all Scripture that just as God'$ love
involves his giving of himself
make uS happy; SO we can
return give of
You
loving
obey
ourselves and actually bring joy to God'
heart: Isaiah promises God'$ people
As the
bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
shall your God rejoice over
you"
(Isa. 62.5), and Zephaniah tells God's people; "The LORD_
your God
in your midst
he will rejoice over You with gladness_
he will renew YOu in
his love; he
exult over YOu with loud singing as on
day of festival"
(Zeph 3.17-18).
Our imitation of God's love
also seen in Our love for others. John makes
this explicit: "Beloved, if God s0 loved us_
we also ought [O love one another'
John 4:11). In fact, our love for others within the fellowship of believers
evidently an imitation of Christ that by it the world
recognizes Us as his:
"By this all men will know that YOu are my disciples
if you have love for one
another" (John 13.35; cf: 15.13; Rom: 13.10;
Cor: 13.4-7; Heb: 10.24). God
himself gives us his love t0 enable Us t0 love each other (John 17.26; Rom
5.5). Moreover; our love for Our enemies especially reflects God's love (Matt:
5.43-48)
8. Mercy, Grace
Patience: God s mercy; patience,
and grace may be seen as
three separate attributes_
0r as
specific aspects of God'$ goodness.
The
definitions given here show these attributes as special
examples of God's
goodness when it is used for the benefit of specific classes of people:
God'$ mercy means God $
goodness toward those in misery and distress_
God'$ grace means God $ goodness
those who deserve only
punishment
God's patience means God $ goodness in withholding of punishment toward
those who sin over
period of time.
These three characteristics of God'
nature are often mentioned
together;
especially in the Old Testament
When God declared his name t0 Moses_
proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD,
God merciful and gracious_
slow tO
anger; and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness
(Ex. 34.6). David
says in Psalm 103.8, "The LORD
merciful and
gracious, slow t0 anger and
abounding
steadfast love:
Because these characteristics of God are often mentioned
together; it may
seem difficult to distinguish among them. Yet the characteristic of mercy is
often emphasized where people are
misery or distress. David says, for
example
am in great distress_
lec us fall into the hand of the LORD for his
mercy 1S great
(2 Sam. 24.14).
The two blind men who wish Jesus t0 see
their plight and heal them cry; "Have mercy 0n US, Son of David" (Matt
Will
toward
9.27)_
When Paul speaks of the fact that God comforts US in affliction; he
calls God the
Father of mercies and God of all comfort" (2 Cor: 1.3)
time of need, we are t0 draw near
God'$ throne s0 that we might receive
both mercy and grace (Heb_
4.16; cf: 2.17; James 5.11). We are tO imitate
God'$ mercy in Our conduct toward others:
Blessed are the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy" (Matt: 5.7; cf:
Cor: 1.3-4)
With respect t0 the attribute of grace
we find that Scripture emphasizes that
God'$ grace, or his favor tOward those who deserve no favor but only
punishment; iS never
obligated but is always freely given on God's part God
says
will be
gracious
[0 whom
will be gracious
and will show mercy on
whom
will show mercy" (Ex. 33.19; quoted in Rom: 9.15). Yet God is
regularly gracious toward his people: "Tur t0 me and be gracious to me;
After Thy manner with those who love Thy name" (Ps. 119.132 NASB) In
Peter can call God "the God of all grace
(1 Peter 5.10).
Grace as God'$ goodness especially shown t0 those who do not deserve it is
seen frequently in Paul'$ writings_
He emphasizes that salvation by grace is
the opposite of salvation by human effort; for grace is
treely given gift
"Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified by
his grace as
gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus
(Rom:
3.23-24). The distinction between grace and
salvation earned by works that
merit
reward is also seen in Romans 11:6: "But if it is by grace; it is no
longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace:
Grace
then, is God'$ favor freely given
those who do not deserve this
favor:
Paul also sees that if grace
unmerited, then there
only one human attitude
appropriate
as an instrument for
receiving such grace, namely, faith:
That is
why it depends on faith; in order that the promise may rest on grace:
(Rom. 4.16). Faith is the one human attitude that is the opposite of depending
on oneself; for it involves trust in or dependence upon another: Thus_
it is
devoid of self-reliance or attempts tO gain righteousness by human effort: If
God's favor is t0 come
from
own merit, then it must come
when we depend not 0n OUI Own merit but 0n the merits of another; and that is
precisely when we have faith:
In the New Testament, and especially in Paul, not only the
forgiveness of sins,
but also the entire living of the Christian life can be seen t0 result from God $
continuous bestowal of grace_
Paul can say; "by the grace of God
am what
am'
(1 Cor: 15.10). Luke speaks of Antioch as the place where Paul and
Barnabas "had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they
fact,
apalt
our
had fulfilled" (Acts 14.26),
indicating that the church there, in sending out
Paul and Barnabas, saw the success of their ministry as dependent upon God'$
continuing grace. Furthermore, the blessing of "grace'
upon Paul'$ readers is
the most frequent apostolic
in his letters (see, eg-. Rom: 1.7; 16.20;
Cor: 1.3; 16.23;
Cor: 1.2; 13.14; Gal. 1.3; 6.18).
God's patience, similarly; was mentioned in some of the verses cited above in
connection with God'$ mercy. The Old Testament frequently
of God as
slow to anger-
(Ex 34.6=
Num
14.18; Pss. 86.15; 103.8; 145.8; Jonah 4.2;
Nah_
1.3; et al.) In the New Testament; Paul speaks about God s "kindness
and forbearance and patience
(Rom 2.4), and says that Jesus Christ
displayed his "perfect patience
toward Paul himself as an example for others
Tim. 1.16; cf: Rom: 9.22;
Peter 3.20).
We are also t0 imitate God'$ patience and be
slow t0
anger" (James 1:19),
and be patient in
suffering
as Christ was (1 Peter 2.20).
We are t0 lead
life
with patience'
(Eph: 42), and
patience'
is listed among the fruit of the
Spirit in Galatians 5.22 (see also Rom: 8.25;
Cor: 13.4; Col: 1:11; 3.12; 2
Tim: 3.10; 4.2; James 5.7-8; Rev 2.2-3; et al.) As with most of the attributes
of God that we are t0 imitate in our lives, patience
requires
moment-Dy -
moment trust in God t0 fulfill his promises and purposes
our lives at his
chosen time. Our confidence that the Lord will soon fulfill his purposes for
our
good and his glory will enable us to be patient: James makes this
connection when he says,
You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the
coming of the Lord is at hand" (James 5.8).
9. Holiness
God $ holiness means that he is separated from sin and devoted
to seeking his own honor: This definition contains both
relational quality
(separation from) and
moral quality (the separation is from sin Or evil, and
the devotion IS [0 the
of God'$ Own honor or glory) The idea of holiness
as including both separation from evil and devotion to God's Own glory is
found in
number of Old Testament passages. The word holy is used t0
describe both parts of the tabernacle, for example
The tabernacle itself was
place separate from the evil and sin of the world, and the first room in it was
called the "holy place:
It was dedicated t0 God $ service. But then God
commanded that there be
veil,
and the veil shall separate for you the
place from the most holy'
(Ex: 26.33). The most holy place, where the ark of
the covenant was
kept, was the place most separated from
and sin and
most fully devoted to God'$ service.
The place where God himself dwelt was itself holy:
Who shall ascend the
of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place?" (Ps. 24.3). The
blessing
speaks
good
holy
evil
hill ,
element of dedication t0 God's service
seen in the holiness of the sabbath
day:
the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made
holy" (or "hallowed it"_
the verb is
Piel
form of qamdash and means "to make holy"
(Ex. 20:11; cf:
Gen. 2.3) The sabbath
was made holy because it was set apart from the
ordinary activities of the world and dedicated t0 God $ service. In the same
way the taberacle and the altar; as well as Aaron and his sons_
were t0 be
made holy" (Ex: 29.44)_
that is_
apart from ordinary tasks and from the
evil and sin of the world and dedicated to God $ service (cf: Ex: 30.25-33).
God himself is the Most Holy One. He is called the
One of Israel" (Pss
71.22; 78.41; 89.18; Isa. 1.4; 5.19,24; et al.) The seraphim around God $
throne cry; "Holy; holy; holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his
glory" (Isa. 6.3).
LORD our God is holy! " exclaims the psalmist (Ps.
99.9; cf: 99.3,5; 22.3)
God'$ holiness provides the pattern for his people t0 imitate
He commands
them; "You shall be holy; for
the LORD your God am holy" (Lev: 19.2; cf:
11.44-45; 20.26;
Peter 1:16). When God called his people out of Egypt and
brought them to himself and commanded them tO
his voice
then he said
You shall be t0 me
kingdom of priests and
holy nation
(Ex. 19.4-6).
this case the idea of separation from evil and sin (which here included in
very
way separation from life in Egypt) and the idea of devotion to
God (in serving him and in
obeying his statutes) are both seen in the example
of a "holy nation.
New
covenant
believers are also t0
strive
for the holiness without which
no one will see the Lord" (Heb: 12.14) and to know that God $ discipline is
given to us "that we may share his holiness" (Heb: 12.10) . Paul encourages
Christians to be separate from the
dominating influence that comes from close
association with unbelievers (2 Cor: 6.14-18) and then encourages them; "Let
uS cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit;, and make
holiness perfect in the fear of God
(2 Cor: 7:1; cf. Rom. 12.1). The church
itself is intended by God tO grow "into
temple in the Lord" (Eph: 2.21),
and Christ'$ present work for the church is
'that he might sanctify her
that
he might present the church to himself in splendor
that she might be holy
and without blemish" (Eph: 5.26-27)_
Not only individuals but also the
church itself must grow in holiness!
Zechariah prophesies
day when everything on earth will be
t0 the
LORD.
He says:
And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses,
day
"Holy'

"Holy t0 the LORD.
And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as
the bowls before the altar; and every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall
be sacred t0 the LORD of hosts. (Zech: 14.20-21)
At that time
everything on earth will be separated from evil, purified from
sin, and devoted t0 the service of God in true moral
purity.
Peace (or Order). In
Corinthians 14.33 Paul says,
God is not
God of
confusion but of peace:
Although
peace
and
order" have not traditionally
been classified as attributes of God, Paul here indicates another quality that
we could think of as
distinct attribute of God
Paul says that God's actions
are characterized by
peace
and not by
disorder" (Gk akatastasia,
word
meaning
disorder; confusion
God himself is
God of peace'
(Rom: 15.33; 16.20; Phil. 4.9;
Thess. 5.23; Heb: 13.20; cf: Eph 2.14; 2
Thess. 3.16) . But those who walk in wickedness do not have peace:
There
is no peace;
says the LORD; 'for the wicked'
(Isa_
48.22; 57.21; cf: 59.8).
However; when God looks with compassion upon the people whom he loves
he sees them as
afflicted
storm-tossed (LXX, akatastatos_
~in disorder; in
confusion'
and not comforted" (Isa. 54:11), and promises t0 establish their
foundations with precious stones (Isa. 54.11-12) and lead them forth in
peace
(Isa. 55.12). The proclamation of God'$ plan of redemption contains
the promise of peace to God'$ people (Pss.
29.11; 85.8; 119.165; Prov 3.17;
Isa. 9.6-7; 26.3; 57.19; John 14.27; Rom
8.6; 2 Thess: 3.16; et al.) In fact;
the third element that Paul lists as
of the fruit of the Spirit is
'peace'
(Gal: 5.22).
peace certainly does not imply inactivity; for it was at
time of intense
growth and activity that Luke could say that "the church throughout all Judea
and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was built up
(Acts 9.31).
Furthermore; although God is
God of peace; he is also the one who "will
neither slumber nor sleep'
(Ps. 121.4). He is the God who is continually
(John 5.17). And even though heaven is
place of peace, it is
place
also of continual
praise to God and service for him:
Thus, God'$ peace can be defined as follows: God $ peace means that in
God '$ being and in his actions he
separate from all confusion and disorder;
yet he is continually active in innumerable well-ordered, fully controlled_
simultaneous actions:
This definition indicates that God $ peace does not have to do with inactivity;
but with ordered and controlled activity: To engage in infinite activity of this
sort, of course, requires God'$ infinite wisdom, knowledge, and power:
unrest"

When
understand God'$ peace in this way we can see an imitation of this
attribute of God not only in
peace"
of the fruit of the Spirit in
Galatians 5.22-23,but also in the last-mentioned element in the fruit of the
Spirit; namely; "self-control" (Gal. 5.23).
When we as God $ people walk in
his ways;
we come
know more and more fully by experience that the
kingdom of God is indeed "righteousness and peace and joy in the
Spirit" (Rom: 14.17), and we can say of the path of God $ wisdom; "Her ways
are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace
(Prov. 3.17).
1. Righteousness_
Justice: In English the terms righteousness and justice are
different words; but in both the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New
Testament there is only one word group behind these two English terms
the Old [estament the terms primarily translate forms of the tsedek word
group; and the New Testament members of the dikaios word group.)
Therefore
these [Wo terms will be considered
together
speaking of one
attribute of God
God $ righteousness means that God always aCtS in accordance with what is
right and is himself the final standard of what
right:
Speaking of God
Moses says; "All his ways are justice:
God of faithfulness
and without iniquity; just and right is he
(Deut: 32.4). Abraham successfully
appeals to God*s own character of righteousness when he says, "Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen. 18.25). God also speaks and commands
whal
right: "The precepts of the LORD are right; rejoicing the heart" (Ps_
19.8). And God says of himself;
the LORD speak the truth,
declare what is
right'
(Isa. 45.19). As
result of God s righteousness_
it is necessary that he
treat people according
what they deserve_
[hus; it is necessary that God
punish sin_
for it does not deserve reward; it is wrong and deserves
punishment
When God does not punish sin;
seems t0 indicate that he is unrighteous
unless some other means of
punishing sin can be seen.
This is why Paul says
that when God sent Christ as
sacrifice t0 bear the punishment for sin
was [0 show God s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had
passed over former sins;
was t0 prove at the present time that he himself is
righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus'
(Rom. 3.25-26).
When Christ died [0 pay the penalty for our sins
showed that God was truly
righteous, because he did give appropriate punishment t0 sin , even though he
did forgive his people their sins.
With respect t0 the definition of righteousness given above; we may ask; what
patt
Holy
is "right"? In other words, what ought to happen and what ought to be? Here
must respond that whatever conforms to God $ moral character is right:
But why
whatever conforms t0 God'$ moral character right? It is right
because
conforms t0 his moral character! [f indeed God is the final standard
of righteousness, then there can be no standard outside of God by which
measure righteousness Or justice_
He himself is the final standard: (This is
similar to the situation we encountered with respect to truth and God
the ultimate standard of truth:
Whenever Scripture confronts the question of
whether God himself is righteous Or not, the ultimate answer is always that
we as
God'$ creatures have no right tO say that God is unrighteous or unjust
The creature cannot say that of the Creator: Paul responds t0
very difficult
question about God's righteousness by saying; "But who are you;
man, t0
answer back to God? Will what
molded say t0 its molder; *Why have YOU
made me thus?
Has the potter no right over the
make out of the same
lump one vessel
for beauty and another for menial use?" (Rom: 9.20-21).
amste
Job's questioning about whether God has been righteous in his
dealings with him, God answers Job, "Shall
faultfinder contend with the
Almighty?
Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that
you may be justified?" (Job 40.2, 8). Then God answers not in terms of an
explanation that would allow Job to understand why God's actions were right;
but rather in terms of
statement of God $ Own majesty and power! God does
not need t0 explain the rightness of his actions t0 Job; for God is the Creator
and Job is the creature. "Have YOu an arm like God_
and can you thunder with
voice like his?" (Job 40.9). "Have you commanded the
since YOuI
began; and caused the dawn to know its place
?" (Job 38.12). "Can
you lift up your voice t0 the clouds, that
flood of waters may cover you?
Can you send forth
lightnings
that they may g0 and say [0 YOU,
are
(Job 38.34-35). "Do YOu give the horse his might?" (Job 39:19). "Is it
by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and spreads his wings toward the
south?" (Job 39.26). Job answers
Behold,
am of small account; what shall
answer
ay my hand on my mouth" (Job 40.4).
Nevertheless_
should be
cause for thanksgiving and gratitude when we
realize that righteousness and omnipotence are both possessed by God_
If he
were
God of perfect righteousness without power [0 canry out that
righteousness_
he would not be worthy of worship and we would have no
guarantee that justice will ultimately prevail in the universe. But if he were
God of unlimited power;
without righteousness in his character; how
unthinkably horrible the universe would be! There would be unrighteousness
at the center of all existence and there would be nothing anyone could do to
change it Existence would become meaningless; and
would be driven

the most utter
despair: We ought therefore continually t0 thank and praise God
for who he is, "for all his Ways are justice:
A God of faithfulness and without
iniquity; just and right is he'
(Deut: 32.4).
12. Jealousy: Although the word jealous is frequently used in
negative
sense in English, it also takes
positive sense at times For example; Paul
says t0 the Corinthians,
feel
divine jealousy for
(2 Cor: 11.2). Here
the sense is
earnestly protective Or' watchful:
It has the meaning of
deeply committed to seeking the honor or welfare of someone
whether
someone else:
Scripture represents God as being
ealous in this way: He continually and
eamestly seeks
protect his own honor: He commands his people not
bow
down to idols or serve them, saying
for
the LORD your God am
jealous
God" (Ex. 20.5). He desires that worship be given to himself and not tO false
Therefore; he commands the people of Israel
to tear down the altars of
pagan
in the land of Canaan; giving the following reason: "For YOu shall
worship no other
for the LORD, whose name is Jealous
jealous God"
(Ex. 34.14; cf: Deut: 4.24; 5.9).
Thus, God'$ jealousy may be defined as follows: God $ jealousy means that
God continually seeks to protect his own honor:
People sometimes have trouble thinking that jealousy is
desirable attribute
in God. This is because jealousy for Our own honor as human beings is almost
always wrong
We are not to be proud_
buc humble:
Yet we must realize that
the reason
pride
wrong
theological reason: it is that we do not deserve
the honor that belongs to God alone (cf:
Cor: 4.7; Rev 411).
It is not wrong for God to seek his own honor; however; for he deserves it
fully. God freely admits that his actions in creation and redemption are done
for his own honor: Speaking of his decision
withhold judgment from his
people_
God says_
"For my own sake;
for my Own sake,
do iL:
My glory
will not give
another
(Isa. 48.11). It is healthy for us spiritually when we
settle in our hearts the fact that God deserves all honor and glory from his
creation, and that it is right for him t0 seek this honor: He alone is infinitely
worthy of being praised. To realize this fact and to delight in it is to find the
secret of tnue
worship_
Wrath: It may surprise US t0 find how frequently the Bible talks about the
wrath of God_
Yer if God loves all that is right and good, and all that conforms
his moral character; then
should not be surprising that he would hate
everything that is opposed to his moral character: God =
wrath directed
You'
being
oneself
gods
Eods
god,
sin is therefore closely related to God's holiness and justice
God's
wrath may be defined as follows: God $ wrath means that he intensely hates
all sin:
Descriptions of God's wrath are found frequently in the narrative passages of
Scripture, especially when God 's people sin greatly against him. God sees the
idolatry of the people of Israel and says t0 Moses;
have seen this people
now therefore let me alone; that my wrath may burn hot against them and
may consume them
(Ex. 32.9-10).
Later Moses tells the people,
Remember
and d not forget how YOu provoked the LORD your God [0 wrath in the
wilderness.
Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD t0 wrath, and the LORD
was SO angry with You that he was ready t0 destroy you" (Deut: 9.7-8; cf.
29.23;
Kings 22:13).
The doctrine of the wrath of God in Scripture is not limited to the Old
Testament; however; as some have falsely imagined_
We read in John 3.36,
"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not
the Son
shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him
Paul says_
"For the
wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness
of men" (Rom
1:18; cf. 2.5_
8; 5.9; 9.22; Col. 36;
Thess. 1:10; 2.16; 5.9;
Heb. %1l; Rev 6.16-17; 19.15). Many more New Testament verses
Iso
indicate God '$ wrath against sin:
As with the other attributes of God_
this is an attribute for which we should
thank and praise God
It may nOt immediately appear
uS how this can be
done , since wrath seems t0 be such
negative concept: Viewed alone; it
would arouse only fear and dread
Yet it is helpful for us t0 ask what God
would be like if he were
God that did not hate sin. He
then be a God
who either delighted in sin or at least was not troubled by it. Such
God
would not be worthy of our worship; for sin is hateful and
is worthy of
being hated. Sin ought not to be: It is in fact
virtue
hate evil and sin (cf:
Heb_
1.9; Zech. &.17; et al.), and we rightly imitate this attribute
God when
we feel
hatred against great evil, injustice, and sin.
Furthermore
should feel no fear of God' s wrath as Christians_
although
Were
by nature children of wrath; like the rest of mankind"
(Eph: 23), we now have trusted in Jesus_
who delivers uS from the wrath to
come
Thess_
1:10; cf. Rom. 5.10). When we meditate on the wrath of
God
we will be amazed t0 think that our Lord Jesus Christ bore the wrath of
God that was due tO our sin, in order that we might be saved (Rom. 3.25-
26).
against
obey
would
Moreover; in thinking about God's wrath we must also bear in mind his
patience_
Both patience and wrath are mentioned together in Psalm 103: "The
LORD is
slow to anger and
abounding in steadfast love: He will not always
chide, nor will he
his anger for ever" (Ps_
103.8-9).
the delay of
the execution of God's wrath upon evil is for the purpose of leading people to
repentance (see Rom: 2.4).
Thus
when we think of God'
wrath t0 come
we should simultaneously be
thankful for his patience in waiting t0 execute that wrath in order that yet
more
may be saved: "The Lord is not slow about his promise as some
count slowness, but is
forbearing toward you,
noc
that any should
perish; but that all should reach repentance
But the day of the Lord will come
like
thief; and then the heavens will pass away with
loud noise
Peter 3.9-10). God's wrath should motivate US t0
evangelism and should also
cause US t0 be thankful that God finally will punish all wrongdoing and will
reign over

heavens and
et
earth in which there will be no
unrighteousness
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION

Can you say that
by-and-large you have God's peace in the sense that your inner life

frequently or continually
active in well-ordered and well-controlled actions that further God' $

your family relationships
your relationships with neighbors, your activities in

What might you do to reflect God $ peace more fully?
Righteousness
Do yOu ever find

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
Exodus 34.6-7: The LORD passed before him, and proclaimed,
The LORD,
the LORD,
God merciful and gracious, slow
anger; and abounding
steadfast love and faithfulness; keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty;
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children $
children, I0 the third and the fourth generation.
Note
The last section of this passage speaks of God
the iniquity of
the fathers upon the children and the children's children.
Some might want
stop short of this part in memorizing the passage, but we should remember
that this
is Scripture and is written for our edification: This statement
shows the horrible nature of sin in the way it has effects far beyond the
individual
sinner; also harming those around the sinner and harming future
generations as well
We see this in tragic Ways in ordinary life, where the
children of alcoholics often become alcoholics and the children of abusive
parents often become abusive parents.
Christians who are
forgiven by Christ should not think of these phrases as
applying t0 them, however; for
are in the other category of people
mentioned just before this section on "the guilty'
they are among the
"thousands

steadfast love;
and is

You know that YOu were ransomed from the futile
ways inherited from your fathers, not with perishable
such as silver or
but with the precious blood of Christ"

Almost the entire hymnbook could be used to sing of one aspect or another of

another;
exhorting each other to

Chapter 4
The Character of God: "Communicable"
Attributes
(Part 2)
How is God like us in attributes of will and in attributes that
summarize his excellence?
In the previous chapter we discussed the attributes of God that described his
being (spirituality; invisibility). his mental attributes (knowledge, wisdom;,
and truthfulness) , and his moral attributes (goodness
love
mercy; grace;
patience; holiness_
peace, righteousness, jealousy; and wrath) In this chapter
will examine God $ attributes of purpose, that is, attributes that have t0 do
with
making and carrying out decisions (will, freedom; and omnipotence) and
his summary attributes (perfection
blessedness, beauty; and glory)
Ftinane
Purjlo
In this category of attributes we will discuss first God's will in general, then
the freedom of God's will, and finally the omnipotence (0r infinite power) of
God'$ will
14. Will. God s
is that attribute of God whereby he approves and
determines t0 bring about every action necessary for the existence and
activity of himself and all creation:
This definition indicates that God $ will has to do with deciding and
approving the
that God
and does. It concerns God $ choices of what
[0 do and what not t0 do.
God's Will in General: Scripture frequently indicates God $ will as the
final or most ultimate reason for
everything that happens_
Paul refers t0 God
as the one
who accomplishes all
according t0 the counsel of his will "
(Eph:
1:11). The phrase here translated "all things'
(ta panta) is used
frequently by Paul to refer t0 everything that exists or
everything in creation
(see, for example, Eph: 1.10,23; 3.9; 4.10; Col: 1.16 [twice]; 17; Rom: 11.36;
Cor: 8.6 [twice]; 15.27-28 [twice])_

More specifically; all
were created by God $ will:
For yOu created all
things, and by your will they existed and were created" (Rev: 4.11). Both Old
and New Testaments speak of human government as coming about according
God $ will: the voice from heaven tells Nebuchadnezzar that he is t0 leam
the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it tO whom he
(Dan. 4.32), and Paul says that
'there is no authority except from God, and
those that exist have been instituted by God" (Rom: 13.1)
All the events connected with the death of Christ were according to God $
will, the church at Jerusalem believed, for in their prayer they said, "truly in
this city there were
gathered together against your holy servant Jesus,
whom
You anointed_
both Herod and Pontius Pilate_
with all the Gentiles and the
peoples of Israel, t0 do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined
take place
(Acts 4.27-28). The specific mention of the various parties
involved at different stages of the crucifixion,
together with the indefiniteness
of the plural
relative pronoun
"whatever" (Gk: hosa,
things which"
implies that not simply the fact of Jesus
death but all the detailed events
connected with it are comprehended in this statement: God's hand and will
had predestined that all those
would come about:
Sometimes
is God' $
that Christians suffer; as is seen in
Peter 3.17, for
example:
For it is better t0 suffer for
right;
that should be God s will,
than for
wrOng:
Then in the next chapter Peter says_
"Therefore lec
those who suffer
according to God $ will do right and entrust their souls to
faithful Creator" (1 Peter 4.19). In this verse, the phrase
according-
God $
will" cannot refer t0 the manner in which Christians endure
suffering; for then
it would make the verse say essentially; "Let those who suffer while doing
rignt; do right and entrust their souls:
This would make the phrase
according
to God $ will" redundant: Rather; the phrase
according
to God $
will" must refer t0 the fact that these Christians are suffering; just as
God $
referred to suffering in the previous chapter (1 Peter 3.17).
James encourages 4S
see all the events of our lives as subject to God $ will.
To those who say; "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such
town
and spend
year there and trade and get gain;
James says, "You do not know
about tomorrow:
Instead you ought tO say; 'if the Lord wills_
we shall live
and we shall do this or that'
(James 4.13-15). To attribute s0 many events;
even evil events_
to the will of God often causes misunderstanding and

difficulty for Christians.
Some of the difficulties connected with this subject
will be treated here and others will be dealt with in chapter 16 on God'$
providence
Distinctions in Aspects of God's Will: (1) Necessary will and free will:
Some distinctions made in the
may help us understand various aspects of
God'$ will. Just as we can will or choose something eagerly or reluctantly;
happily or with regret, secretly 0r publicly, so also God in the infinite
greatness of his personality is able to will different things in different ways.
One helpful distinction applied t0 aspects of God $ will is the distinction
between God s necessary will and God s free will God
necessary will
includes everything that he must will according to his own nature_
What does
God
necessarily? He
himself: God eterally wills to be
0r" wants [0
be; who he is and what he is. He says_
"AM WHO
AM" 0r;,
WILL BE
WHAT
WILL BE" (Ex: 3.14). God cannot choose to be different than he is
t0 cease
exist:
God's free will includes all
that God decided t0 will but had no
necessity t0 will
according 5
to his nature_
Here we must put God's decision to
create the universe, and all the decisions relating t0 the details of that creation.
Here We must also place all God'
acts of redemption. There was
nothing in
God'
own nature that required him to decide t0 create the universe Or t0
redeem Out of sinful mankind
people for himself (see the discussion above
concerning God $ independence). However; God did decide
create and t0
redeem, and these were totally free choices on his part: Though within the
members of the Trinity love and fellowship and glory exist in infinite measure
for all eternity (see John 17.5, 24), nonetheless God decided t0 create the
universe and to redeem us for his own glory (cf. Isa_
43.7; 48.9-11; Rom:
11.36;
Cor: 8.6; Eph: 1:12; Rev 411) It would be wrong for US ever [0 try
to find
necessary cause fOr creation or redemption
the being of God
himself, for that would rob God
his total independence_
It would be
say
that without us God could not truly be God. God's decisions t0 create and t0
redeem were totally free decisions:
Secret will and revealed will: Another helpful distinction applied to
different aspects of God $ will is the distinction between God $ secret will and
his revealed will Even in Our' OWn experience
we know thar we are able [0
some things secretly and then only later make this will known [0 others
Sometimes we tell others before the
that we have willed comes about;
and at other times we do not revea
OuI secret will until the event
willed
has happened:
past

Surely
distinction between aspects of God $ will is evident in many
passages of Scripture. According to Moses_
The secret things belong to the
LORD our God; but the
that are revealed
belong to us and to our
children for ever; that we may do all the words of this law
(Deut: 29.29).
Those
that God has revealed are given for the purpose of obeying
God
will: "that we may do all the words of this law'
There
were many
other aspects of his plan; however; that he had not revealed to them: many
details about future events, specific details of hardship or of
in their
and s0 forth With
t0 these malters_
they were simply t0 trust
him_
Because God $ revealed will usually contains his commands or "precepts" for
moral
conduct; God $ revealed will is sometimes also called God'$ will of
precept 0r will of command. This revealed
of God is God's declared
concerning what we should do 0r what God commands us t0 do_
On the other hand, God $ secret will usually includes his hidden decrees by
which he governs the universe and determines
everything that will happen:
He does not ordinarily reveal these decrees
us (except in prophecies of the
future) , s0 these decrees really are God' $
secret" will_
We find out what God
has decreed when events actually happen_
Because this secret
ot God has
do with his decreeing of events in the world, this aspect of God's will is
sometimes also called God'$
of decree:
There are several instances
where Scripture mentions God $ revealed will. In
the Lord $ prayer the petition,
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven"
(Matt. 6.10) is
prayer that people would obey God'$ revealed will
commands_
on earth just as they do
heaven (that
fully and completely).
This could nor be
prayer that God:
secret will (that is, his decrees for
events that he has planned) would in fact be fulfilled, for what God has
decreed in his secret will shall certainly come t0 pass. To ask God to bring
about what he has already decreed to happen would simply be to pray;
what
going to happen happen:
That would be
hollow prayer indeed, for it
would not be asking for anything at all_
Furthermore, since we do not know
God
secret will regarding the future, the person praying
prayer for God's
secret will to be done would never know for what he or she was praying: It
would be
prayer without understandable content and without effect. Rather;
the prayer
Your will be done
must be understood as an appeal for the
revealed will of God to be followed on earth
If the phrase is understood in this way; it provides
pattern for US t0 pray on
the basis of God' $ commands in Scripture_
In this sense
Jesus provides uS

for an exceedingly broad range of prayer requests_
We are
encouraged by Christ here tO pray that people would obey God's laws, that
they would follow his principles for life, that they would obey his commands
repent of sin and trust in Christ as Savior: To pray these
things is to pray
that God $
would be done on earth as
is in heaven:
A little later; Jesus says
Not every one who says to me;
Lord, Lord,
shall
enter the kingdom of heaven
but he who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven"
(Matt: 7.21). Once
the reference cannot be t0 God'$ secret will
will of decree (for all mankind follows this_
even if unknowingly) , but
God'$ revealed will, namely; the moral law of God that Christ's followers are
(cf: Matt: 12.50; probably also 18.14). When Paul commands the
Ephesians
'understand what the will of the Lord is
(Eph: 5.17; cf:
Rom:
2.18) , he again is speaking of God's revealed will. So also is John when he
says
"If we ask
anything according to his will he hears us
John 5.14).
It is probably best tO put
Timothy 2.4 and
Peter 3.9 in this category a5
well
Paul says that God
desires [or
wills_
wishes
Gk. theleo] all men to be
saved and t0 come [0 the
knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim: 2:4). Peter says that
the Lord
is not slow about his promise as some count slowness_
but is
forbearing toward YOu_
not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
reach repentance'
(2 Peter 3.9).
neither of these verses can God'$ will be
understood t0 be his secret will, his decree
concerning what will certainly
occur: This is because the New Testament is clear that there will be
final
judgment and not all will be saved. It is best therefore tO understand these
references as
speaking of God s revealed will, his commands for mankind to
obey and his declaration
uS of what is pleasing
his sight
On the other hand, many passages speak of God's secret will. When James
tells us tO say;
the Lord wills, we shall live and we shall do this or that"
(James 4:15), he cannot be talking about God*s revealed
precept; for with
t0 many 0f OuL actions
know that
is according
God'$ command that we do one or another activity that we have planned
Rather; t0 trust in the secret will of God overcomes pride and expresses
humble dependence on God's sovereign control over the events of our lives_
Another instance
found in Genesis 50.20. Joseph says t0 his brothers;
for you, YOu meant evil against mez
but God meant
for good, to bring it
about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today:
Here God' $
revealed will to Joseph s brothers was that
should love him and nOL steal
from him Or sell him into slavery 0r make plans t0 murder him. But God'$
secret will was that in the disobedience of Joseph
brothers

When Paul says
the Corinthians_
"Twill come
You soon, if the Lord
wills
(1 Cor: 4:19), he is not speaking of God $ revealed will, for Paul has
already determined
in obedience to God and in fulfillment of his apostolic
office, to come [0 visit the Corinthians. He is speaking rather of God's secret
will, his hidden plan for the future
which is unknown [0 Paul and which will
be known only as it comes to pass (cf: Acts 21:14; Rom: 1:10; 15.32; Eph:
1:11;
Peter 3.17; 4.19).
Both the revealing of the good news of the gospel to some and its hiding from
others are said to be
according
God $ will Jesus says
thank you, Father;
Lord of heaven and earth_
that you have hidden these
from the wise and
understanding and revealed them to babes; yea, Father; for such was your
gracious will
(Matt_ 11.25-26).
must reter t0 God' $ secret will;
for his revealed will is that all come
salvation. Indeed, only tWO verses
later; Jesus commands everyone; "Come to me; all who labor and are heavy
laden, and
give YOu rest" (Matt: 11:28). And both Paul and Peter tell us
that God wills all people to be saved (see
Tim. 2.4;
Peter 3.9). Thus
the
fact that some are not saved and some have the gospel
hidden from them must
be understood as happening
according
God'$ secret will, unknown t0 uS
and inappropriate fOr US t0 seek t0 pry into. In the same
way we must
understand the mention of God's will in Romans 9.18 ("He has mercy upon
whomever he wills, and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills'
and Acts
4.28
"to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined t0 take
place
as references t0 God' $ secret will.
There
danger in speaking about evil events as
happening according =
the
will of God_
even though we see Scripture
speaking of them in this way: One
danger is that we might begin t0 think that God takes pleasure in evil, which
he does not do (see Ezek: 33.11) , though he can use it for his good purposes
(see chapter 16 for further discussion) Another
danger is that we might begin
blame God for sin; rather than ourselves, Or 0 think that we are not
responsible for our evil actions . Scripture
however; does not hesitate
couple statements of God's sovereign will with statements of man $
responsibility for evil
Peter could say in the same sentence that Jesus was
"delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God,
and
also thar "this Jesus
you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men
(Acts 2.23). Both God's hidden will of decree and the culpable wickedness of
"lawless men'
canying
out are affirmed
the same statement: However
we may understand the secret workings of God*s hidden will,
MuSt never
having
gained
things
This
again
Will
understand it t0 imply that we are freed from responsibility for evil, or that
God is ever to be blamed for sin. Scripture never speaks that way; and we may
not either; even though how this can be 50 may remain
mystery for 4S in this
age.
15. Freedom: God 5 freedom is that attribute of God whereby he does
whatever he pleases.
This definition implies that
in all creation can
hinder God from doing his will. This attribute of God is therefore closely
related to his will and his power: Yet this aspect of freedom focuses on the
fact that God is not constrained by
anything external to himself and that he is
free [0 do whatever he wishes [0 do_
There is no person or force that can ever
dictale
God what he should do. He is under no authority 0r external
restraing
God'$ freedom is mentioned in Psalm 115, where his great power is
contrasted with the weakness of idols: "Our God is in the heavens; he does
whatever he pleases
(Ps. 115.3)
Human rulers are not able t0 stand against
God and effectively oppose his will, for "the
's heart is
stream of water
in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will" (Prov: 21.1). Similarly;
Nebuchadnezzar learns in his repentance that it is true t0 say of God;, "he does
according t0 his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the
earth; and none can stay his hand 0r say to him,
What are You doing?
(Dan. 4.35).
Because God is free we should not try tO seek any more ultimate answer for
God's actions in creation than the fact thar he willed t0 d0
something
and that
has perfect freedom (S0 long as the actions he takes are consistent
with his own moral character). Sometimes people try to discover
the reason
why God had t0 do one or another action (such as create the world or save
4s). It is better simply to say that it was God's totally free will (working in a
way consistent with his character) that was the fina
reason Why he chose t0
create the world and t0 save sinners.
16. Omnipotence (Power; Sovereignty). God $ omnipotence means that God
is able t0 do all his holy will
word omnipotence
derived from tWO
Latin words
omni;
and potens_
powerful,
and means
all-powerful:
Whereas God's freedom referred t0 the fact that there are no external
constraints on God's decisions, God $ omnipotence has reference t0 his Own
power to do what he decides to do_
This power is frequently mentioned in Scripture_
God is "The LORD, strong
and mighty; the LORD, mighty
battle!" (Ps. 24.8). The rhetorical question;
nothing
king
will
The
anything too hard for the LORD?" (Gen.
18.14; Jer: 32.27) certainly
implies (in the contexts in which it occurs) that nothing is t0o hard for the
LORD: In fact; Jeremiah says t0 God,
'nothing is too hard for you" (Jer:
32.17).
Paul says that God is "able t0 do far more abundantly than all that we ask or
think" (Eph: 3.20), and God is called the
Almighty" (2 Cor: 6.18; Rev: 1.8),
term (Gk pantokrator) that suggests the possession of all power and
authority. Furthermore, the angel Gabriel says to Mary; "With God nothing
will be impossible'
(Luke 1.37), and Jesus says_
"With God all
are
possible
(Matt: 19.26).
'These passages indicate that
power is
infinite, and that he is therefore
not imited [0 doing only what he actually has done: In fact; God is able [0 do
more than he actually does_
For example, John the Baptist says in Matthew
3.9_
"God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham '
God is
one who "does whatever he pleases" (Ps. 115.3); he could have destroyed
[srael
and raised up
great nation from Moses (cf: Ex 32.10), but he did not
do so_
However; there are some things that God cannot do. God cannot will or do
anything that would
his Own character: This
why the definition of
omniporence
stated in terms of
God's ability to do
all his holy will:
It is
not absolutely everything that God is able t0 do, but everything that is
consistent with his character: For example, God cannot lie
In Titus 1.2 he is
called (literally) "the
unlying God" or the
God who never lies
The author
of Hebrews says that in God'$ oath and promise "it is impossible for God t0
lie" (Heb. 6.18, author
translation). Second Timothy 2.13 says of Christ;
"He cannor
himself:
Furthermore
James says, "God cannot be tempted
with evil and he himself tempts no one'
(James 1.13)
God cannor lie,
sin, deny himself;
be tempted with evil He cannot cease t0 exist,
cease
be God_
act in
way inconsistent with any of his attributes.
This means that it is not entirely accurate t0 say that God can do
anything:
Even the Scripture passages quoted above that use phrases similar to this must
be understood in their contexts [0
MEdl
that God can do anything he wills to
do or
anything that is consistent with his character: Although God s power is
infinite; his use of that power is qualified by his other attributes (just as all
God's attributes qualify all his actions) This is therefore another instance
where
misunderstanding would result if one attribute were isolated from the
rest of God's character and emphasized in
disproportionate way:
things
God"

Thus;
God'$ exercise of power over his creation
also called God's sovereignty:
God'$ sovereignty is his exercise of rule (as "sovereign'
or "king'
over his
creation This subject

providence_

Although our will is not absolutely free in the way God s is,
God has
nonetheless given us relative freedom within Our spheres of activity in the
universe he has created:
In fact; we have an intuitive sense that it is our ability t0 exercise our wills
and make choices_
and t0 do so in
relatively free way; that is one of the most
significant marks of God-likeness in our existence Of course Our desire

themselves in sinful ways. People can become proud and can desire

17. Perfection. God $ perfection means that God completely possesses all
excellent qualities and lacks no part of any qualities that would be desirable
for him:
Will
lives
ohey
will
will
beings
regain
deep
brings
It is difficult t0 decide whether this should be listed as
separate attribute or
simply be included in the description of the other attributes. Some passages
say that God is "perfect" or
complete
Jesus tells us_
You; therefore_
must
be perfect; as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matc: 5.48).
And David says
of God_
way is
perfect" (Ps. 18.30; cf. Deut: 32.4). There is some
scriptural precedent; therefore_
for stating explicitly that God lacks nothing in
his excellence: he fully possesses all of his attributes and lacks
from
any one of those attributes.
Furthermore
there is no quality of excellence that
it would be desirable for God to have that he does not have: he is
complete'
perfect" in every way:
This attribute is the first of those classified as
summary" attribute because
it does not fit well into the other categories that have been listed. Even though
all the attributes of God modify all the others in some senses
those that fit in
this category seem more directly to apply to all the attributes Or t0 describe
some aspect of all of the attributes that it is worthwhile
state explicitly:
Blessedness_
To be "blessed" is to be happy in
very full and rich sense.
Often Scripture talks about the blessedness of those people who walk in
God'$ ways. Yet in
Timothy Paul calls God "the blessed and only
Sovereign"
Tim. 6.15) and speaks of
glorious
of the blessed
God" (1
Tim.
1:11) . In both instances the word is not eulogetos (which is
often translated "blessed"
but makarios (which means "happy
Thus, God's blessedness may be defined as follows: God $ blessedness means
that God delights fully
himself and in all that reflects his character: In this
definition the idea of God's happiness or blessedness is connected directly
his Own person as the focus of all that is worthy of joy or delight: This
definition indicates that God
perfectly happy; that he has fullness of joy in
himself:
The definition reflects the fact that God takes pleasure in everything in
creation that mirrors his Own excellence_
When he finished his work of
creation, he looked at
everything that he had made and saw that it was
very
good" (Gen. 1.31).
indicates God's delight in and approval of his
creation_
Then in Isaiah we read
promise of God s future rejoicing over his
people:
As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride
shall your God rejoice
over yOu
(Isa_
62.5; cf. Prov: 8.30-31; Zeph: 317).
It may at first seem strange Or even somewhat disappointing [0 4S that when
God rejoices in his creation, Or even when he rejoices in us, it is really the
reflection of his own excellent qualities in which he is rejoicing: But when we
"His
nothing
"the
gospel
This
remember that the sum of
everything that is desirable Or excellent is found in
infinite measure in God himself, then we realize that it could not be
otherwise
whatever excellence there is in the universe;
whatever is desirable;
must ultimately have come from him; for he is the Creator of all and he is the
source of all
Every
endowment and every perfect gift is from
above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no
variation 0r shadow due [0
change'
(James 1:17).
We ought therefore
say
ourselves
as Paul says t0 the Corinthians_
"What
have YOu that you did not receive? If then yOu received it, why do you boast
as if
were not
gift?" (1 Cor: 4.7) "For from him and through him and tO
him are all
To him be glory for ever" (Rom: 11.36).
We imitate God's blessedness when we find
delight and happiness in all that
pleasing to God, both those aspects of Our Own lives that are
pleasing
God and the deeds of others_
when we are thankful for and delight in
the
specific abilities_
preferences
and other characteristics
which God
has created uS as individuals, then we also imitate his attribute of blessedness
Furthermore
we imitate God's blessedness by
rejoicing in the creation as it
reflects various aspects of his excellent character: And we find Our greatest
blessedness
greatest happiness
in delighting in the source of all
qualities
God himself:
19. Beauty. God $ beauty is that attribute of God whereby he is the sum of all
desirable qualities
attribute of God has been implicit in
number of the
preceding attributes, and is especially related to God's perfection. However;
God'$ perfection was defined in such
way as t0 show that he does not lack
anything that would be desirable for him. This attribute, beauty; is defined in
positive way t0 show that God actually does possess all desirable qualities:
perfection'
means that God doesn
lack
anything desirable; "beauty
means
that God has everything desirable: They are two different ways of affirming
the same truth.
Nevertheless_
there is value in
affirming this positive aspect of God's
possession of everything that is desirable: It reminds us that all of our
and righteous desires, all of the desires that really ought to be in us Or in any
other creature, find their ultimate fulfillment in God and in no one else
David speaks of the beauty of the LORD in Psalm 27:.4: "One thing have
asked of the LORD_
that will
seek after; that
may dwell in the house of the
LORD all the
of my life; to behold the beauty of the LORD; and to inquire
in his temple:
A similar idea is expressed

psalm: -
heaven but you? And there is
upon earth that
desire besides you"
(Ps. 73.25) . In both cases, the psalmist recognizes that his desire for God, who
is the sum of everything desirable
far surpasses all other desires. This desire
culminates in
be near God and t0 enjoy his presence forevermore.
Thus
the greatest blessing of the heavenly city shall be this:
shall see
his face
(Rev: 22.4).
Anne R
Cousin certainly had
proper perspective on heaven, for in the last
stanza of her hymn; "The Sands of Time are Sinking
she wrote:
The bride eyes not her garment;
But her dear bridegroom'
tace
will not gaze at glory;
But on my King of grace;
Not at the crown he giveth,
But on his pierced hand:
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Emmanuel s land_
We reflect God s beauty in OUr Own lives when we exhibit conduct that is
pleasing to him: Thus, Peter tells wives in the churches to which he writes
that their
adorning'
(that is_
their source of beauty) should be "the hidden
person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of_
gentle and quiet spirit;
which in God $ sight is
precious"
(1 Peter 3.4). Similarly; Paul instructs
servants that by their conduct
should
adorn the doctrine of God our
Savior
(Titus 2.10).
The beauty of our lives is so important t0 Christ that his purpose nOw is t0
sanctify the entire church "that he might present the church to himself in
splendor; without spot or wrinkle or any such
that she might be holy
and without blemish" (Eph: 5.27). Thus_
we individually and corporately
reflect God's beauty in every way in which we exhibit his character: When we
reflect his character; he delights in us and finds us beautiful in his sight
But we also delight in God's excellence as we see it manifested in the lives of
our brothers and sisters in the Lord.
Therefore it is right that we feel joy and
nothing
longing
They
very
they
thing ,
delight in the fellowship of one another; and that this joy deepens as our
conformity to the life of Christ increases. It is right that we long to be in the
fellowship of God'$ people in which God s character is manifested, for when
delight in the
godliness of God*s people;
we are
ultimately delighting in
God himself as
we see his character evidenced in the lives of his people:
20. Glory: In one sense of the word glory it simply means "honor" or
excellent reputation.'
This
the meaning of the term in Isaiah 43.7, where
God speaks of his children;
whom
created for my glory;
0r' Romans 3.23,
which says that all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God:
It also has
that
in John 17.5, where Jesus
t0 the Father of
the glory
which
had with you before the world was made;
and in Hebrews 1.3, which
says that the Son "is the radiance of God*s glory
(author's translation). In
this sense, the glory of God is not exactly an attribute of his being but rather
describes the superlative honor that should be given to God by
everything in
the universe (including_
1.3 and John 17.5_
the honor that is shared
among the members of the Trinity)
But that is not the sense of the word glory
that we are concerned with in this section:
another sense, God's "glory'
means the bright light that surrounds God s
presence. Since God is spirit; and not
matter, this visible light is not
part of God $
but is
something that-
Was
created_
We may define it as
follows: God $ glory is the created brightness that surrounds God $ revelation
of himself
This
attribute'
of God is really not an attribute of God in the sense that the
others were
for here
we are
speaking not of God*$ own character but of the
created light or brilliance that surrounds God as he manifests himself in his
creation. Thus
God"s glory in this sense
not actually an attribute of God in
himself: Nevertheless
God'$ glory is
something
thal
belongs to him alone and
is the appropriate Outward expression of his Own excellence_
It seems right
therefore
treat
here immediately after the attributes of God.
Scripture often speaks of God's glory. David asks
"Who is this
glory? [he LORD of hosts_
ne is the King 0f gloryl-
(Ps. 24.10). We read
Psalm 104.1-2,"0 LORD my God, YOu are very great! You are clothed with
honor and majesty; YOu who cover yourself with light as with
garment
This glory of God
frequently mentioned in the Old Testament:
It is mentioned again in the New Testament in connection with the
annunciation of Jesus' birth to the shepherds:
And an angel of the Lord
appeared to them; and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they Were

enetgy
being

filled with fear" (Luke 2.9). God $ glory was also evident at the
transfiguration of Christ (cf. Matt: 17.2), and we find in the heavenly city yet
come that "the city has no need of sun or moon t0 shine upon it; for the
glory of God is its light; and its lamp
the Lamb" (Rev: 21.23).
It is very appropriate that God's revelation of himself should be accompanied
by such splendor and brightness, for this glory of God is the visible
manifestation of the excellence of God $ character: The greatness of God's
being; the perfection of all his attributes, is something that we
never fully
comprehend, but before which we can only stand in awe and worship. Thus
is appropriate indeed that the visible manifestation of God be such that we
would be unable tO gaze fully upon it, and that it would be so bright that
would call forth both
delight and deep awe from Us when we behold it
only in part:
Quite
amazingly; God made us t0 reflect his glory Paul tells us that even nOw
in our Christian lives
all are being "changed into his likeness from one
degree of glory to another" (2 Cor: 3.18; cf. Matt: 5.16; Phil 2:15). Though
we do not nOw find ourselves surrounded by
visible light; there is
brightness_
splendor; OF
beauty about the manner of life of
person who
deeply loves God_
and it is often evident [0 those around such
person: In the
life t0 come
such brightness will be intensified_
that as we reign with
Christ; it seems that we also will receive an outward appearance that is
appropriate t0 that reign and to Our status as image bearers of God and
servants of the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. Prov: 4.18; Dan: 12.3; Matt_ 13.43;
Cor: 15.43).
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Will, Freedom
As children grow toward adulthood_
what are proper and improper
ways for them t0 show in their own lives greater and greater exercise of
individual will and freedom from parental control? Are these to be
expected as evidence of our creation in the image of God?
Power
If God's power is his ability t0 do what he wills to do
then is power
for us the ability to
God's will and bring about results in the world
that are pleasing to him? Name several
ways
which we can increase in
such power in our
great
obey
lives
Perfection
How does God $ attribute of perfection remind us that we can never
be satisfied with the reflection of only some of God s character in our
Own lives? Can you describe some aspects of what it would mean to "be
perfect" as our heavenly Father is perfect with respect tO yOur own life?
Blessedness
Are You happy with the way God created YOu
with the physical,
emotional, mental, and relational
traits he gave you? With the sex he gave
you (whether masculine or feminine)? With the spiritual gifts he has given
you?
what ways is it right to be happy 0r pleased with our own
personalities, physical characteristics, abilities
positions
etc.? In what
ways
it wrong to be pleased or happy about these things? Will we ever
be fully "blessed" or happy? When will that be and why?
Think about the qualities that you admire in other people, both
Christians and non-Christians.
Which of these are right t0 admire and
which are not? How can you decide? How can we come t0 delight more
frequently and more fully in God himself?
Beauty
If we refuse t0 accept 0ur society'$ definition of beauty; Or even the
definitions that we ourselves may have worked with previously; and
decide that that which is truly beautiful
the character of God himself;
then how will our understanding of beauty be different from the one we
previously held?
we still be able t0 rightly apply our new idea of
beauty t0 some of the
previously thought to be beautiful?
0r' why not?
Can you understand why David $ one desire above all others in life
was
that
may dwell in the house of the LORD all the
of my life;
behold the beauty of the LORD_
and [0
inquire in his temple" (Ps_
27.4)?
Glory
When the shepherds near Bethlehem experienced the glory of the
Lord shining around them; "they were filled with fear" (Luke 2.9). Yet
when
come (0 live forever in the heavenly city;
will continually be
surrounded by the light of the glory of the Lord (Rev 21.23). Will we

God in Three Persons: The Trinity
How can God be three persons, yet one God?
The preceding chapters have discussed many attributes of God_
But if we
understood only those attributes_
we would not
rightly understand God at all,
for we would not understand that God_
in his very being
has always existed
as more than one person
In fact; God exists as three persons, yet he is one
God
It is important tO remember the doctrine of the Trinity in connection with the
study of God $ attributes_
When we think of God as eternal, omnipresent;
omnipotent; and s0 forth, we may have
tendency t0 think only of God the
Father
connection with these attributes.
But the biblical teaching on the
Trinity tells us that all of God:
attributes are true of all three persons, for
each is fully God_
Thus
God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are also eternal,
omnipresent; omnipotent; infinitely wise; infinitely holy; infinitely loving
omniscient; and s0 forth:
The doctrine of the Trinity is one of the most important doctrines of the
Christian faith_
To study the Bible
on the Trinity gives 4S great
insight into the question that is at the center of all of our seeking after God:
What is God like in himself? Here we learn that in himself, in his very being_
God exists in the persons of Father; Son; and Holy Spirit, yet he
one God:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We may define the doctrine of the Trinity as follows: God eternally exists as
three persons, Father; Son, and Holy Spirit; and each person is fully God, and
there
one God:
The Doctrine of the Trinity Is Progressively Revealed in Scripture
Partial Revelation in the Old Testament: The word trinity is never found
in the Bible, though the idea represented by the word
taught
many
places_
The word trinity means "tri-unity" or "three-in-oneness
Ic is used [0
teachings
summarize the teaching of Scripture that God is three persons yet one God
Sometimes people think the doctrine of the Trinity is found only in the New
Testament; not in the Old: If God has eternally existed as three persons, it
would be surprising to find no indications of that in the Old Testament:
Although the doctrine of the Trinity is not explicitly found in the Old
Testament; several passages suggest Or even imply that God exists as more
than one person.
For instance, according t0 Genesis 1:26, God said
Let uS make man in our
image; after our likeness_
What do the plural verb
"let us"=
and the plural
pronoun
our"
mean? Some have suggested they are plurals of majesty;
form of speech
king would use
saying; for example
"We are pleased
grant YOUI request:
However; in Old Testament Hebrew there are no other
examples of
monarch using plural verbs or plural pronouns of himself in
such
"plural of majesty;
so this suggestion has no evidence tO suppOrt
Another
suggestion is that God is here speaking
angels_
But angels did not
participate in the creation of man, nor was man created in the image and
likeness of angels_
this suggestion is not convincing: The best explanation
is that already in the first chapter of Genesis we have an indication of
plurality of persons in God himself.
We are not told how many persons, and
have nothing approaching
complete doctrine of the [rinity, but it is
implied that more than one person is involved_
The same can be said of
Genesis 3.22
"Behold, the man has become like one of uS
knowing good and
Genesis 11:7
Come, let uS go down; and there confuse their
language
and Isaiah 6.8 ("Whom shall
send, and who will go for us?" )
(Note the combination of singular and plural in the same sentence in the last
passage.)
Moreover; there are passages where one person is called "God" or "the Lord"
and is distinguished from another person who is also said to be God. In Psalm
45.6-7 (NIV)
the psalmist says,
Your throne;
God, will last for ever and
ever:
You love righteousness and hate wickedness_
therefore God
your
God
has set YOu above your companions by
anointing YOU with the oil of
joy:
Here the psalm passes beyond describing anything that could be true of
an earthly king and calls the king
God"
6), whose throne will last
"forever and ever:'
But then, still
speaking to the person called "God
the
author says thar
God
your God, has set YOu above your companions'
So two separate persons are called "God" (Heb: 'Elohim) In the New
Testament; the author of Hebrews quotes this passage and applies it to Christ:
"Your throne
0 God, is for ever and ever" (Heb. 1.8).
evil"
Similarly; in Psalm 110:1, David says_
The LORD says t0 my lord:
Sit at my
right hand until
make your enemies
footstool for your feet'
(NIV) Jesus
understands that David is referring
tWO separate persons as "Lord"
(Matt: 22.41-46), but who is David $ "Lord" if not God himself
And who
could be saying
God,
Sit at my right hand" except someone else who is
also fully God? From
New Testament perspective
we can paraphrase this
verse: "God the Father said to God the Son; 'Sit at my right hand.
But even
without the New Testament
on the Trinity;
seems clear that David
was aware
plurality of persons in one God_
Jesus, of course, understood
this_
but when he asked the Pharisees for an explanation of this passage_
one was able t0 answer him
word, nor from that day did any one dare t0 ask
him any more questions"
(Matt: 22.46). Unless they are
to admit a
plurality of persons
one God, Jewish interpreters of Scripture t0 this day
will have nO more satisfactory explanation of Psalm 11O:1 (01 of Gen_
1.26, 0r
of the other passages just discussed) than
did in Jesus day:
Isaiah 63.10 says that God'$ people
rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit"
(NIV) , apparently suggesting both that the Holy Spirit is distinct from God
himself (it is "his Holy Spirit">
and that this Holy Spirit can be
thus suggesting emotional capabilities characteristic of
distinct person. (Isa_
61.1 also
distinguishes "The Spirit of the Lord GOD" from "the LORD;
even
though no personal qualities are attributed t0 the Spirit of the Lord in that
verse_
Similar evidence is found in Malachi; when the Lord says_
The Lord whom
you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in
whom yOu
delight; behold, he is coming; says the LORD of hosts. But who can
endure the day of his coming; and who can stand when he appears?" (Mal.
3.1-2). Here again the one speaking ("the LORD of hosts") distinguishes
himself from "the Lord whom you seek;
suggesting tWo separate persons_
both of whom can be called "Lord:
In Hosea 1.7, the Lord is
speaking; and says of the house of Judah,
will
deliver them by the LORD their God;
Once
suggesting that more than
one person can be called "Lord" (Heb. Yahweh) and
God"
Elohim).
And in Isaiah 48:16, the speaker (apparently the servant of the Lord) says,
And now the Lord GOD has sent me and his Spirit
Here the Spirit of the
Lord, like the servant of the Lord, has been
sent" by the Lord GOD on
particular mission: The parallel
between the two objects of
me" and
"his Spirit"
would be consistent with seeing them both as distinct persons: it

medlz
than simply

fact, trom
full New Testament perspective (which recognizes Jesus the
Messiah to be the true servant of the Lord predicted in Isaiah'$ prophecies),
Isaiah 48.16 has trinitarian implications:
And now the Lord GOD has sent
me and his Spirit;
if spoken by Jesus the Son of God, refers t0 all three
persons of the Trinity.
Furthermore, several Old Testament passages about
'the angel of the LORD'
suggest
plurality of persons in God. The word translated "angel" (Heb
mal 'ak) means simply
messenger:
If this
angel of the LORD is
messenger
of the LORD, he is then distinct from the LORD himself. Yet at
SUME
points the angel of the LORD is called "God"
LORD'
(see Gen_
16.13; Ex 3.2-6; 23.20-22 [note
my name is in him" in v 2l]; Num 22.35
with 38; Judg: 2:1-2; 6.11 with 14). At other points in the Old Testament "the
angel of the LORD" simply refers t0
created
angel, but at least at these texts
the special angel (or "messenger"
of the LORD seems t0 be
distinct person
who is fully divine
One of the most disputed Old Testament texts that could show distinct
personality for more than one person is Proverbs 8.22-31. Although the
earlier part of the chapter could be understood
merely
personification of
"wisdom
for literary effect; showing wisdom
to the simple and
inviting them tO learn
22-31,
one could argue
say things about
wisdom'
that seem
go far beyond mere personification. Speaking of the time when
God created the earth; "wisdom" says,
Then
was the craftsman at his side:
was filled with delight day after day; rejoicing always in his presence;
rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind" (Prov: 8.30-31 NIV)
To work as
craftsman" at God's side in the creation suggests in itself the
idea of distinct personhood_
and the
following phrases might seem even more
convincing; for only real
persons can be "filled with delight day after day"
and can rejoice in the world and delight in mankind_
But if we decide that
wisdom" here really refers t0 the Son of God before he
became man_
there is
difficulty. Verses 22-25 (RSV) seem to speak of the
creation of this person who is called "wisdom'
The LORD created me at the beginning of his work;
the first of his acts of old:
Ages ago
was set up,

~the

the
before the
beginning of the earth:
When there were no depths
was brought forth;
when there were no springs
abounding with water:
Before the mountains had been shaped,
before the hills,
was brought forth:
Does this not indicate that this "wisdom" was created?
it does not: The Hebrew word that commonly means
create
(bara )
is not used in verse 22; rather the word is qanah, which occurs eighty-four
times
the Old Testament and almost always means "tO
acquire_
The
NASB is most clear here: "The Lord possessed me at the
beginning of his
way" (similarly KJV) (Note this sense of the word in Gen. 39:1; Ex: 21.2;
Prov: 4.5,7; 23.23; Eccl: 2.7; Isa. 1.3
owner"
This is
legitimate sense
and, if wisdom is understood as
real person, would mean only that God the
Father
began
direct and make use of the powerful creative work of God the
Son at the time creation began
the Father summoned the Son tO work with
him in the activity of creation. The expression "brought forth" in verses 24
and 25 is
different term but could cany
similar meaning: the Father began
direct and make use of the powerful creative work of the Son in the
creation of the universe.
2. More Complete Revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament When
the New Testament opens
we enter
into the history of the coming of the Son
of God t0 earth: It is t0 be expected that this great event would be
accompanied by more explicit teaching about the trinitarian nature of God,
and that is in fact what we find. Before looking at this in detail, we can simply
list several
passages where all three persons of the Trinity are named together:
When Jesus was baptized_
"the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of
God

am well pleased'
(Matt: 316-17). Here at one moment we have three members of the Trinity
performing three distinct activities_
God the Father is
speaking from heaven;
God the Son
being baptized and
then spoken [O from heaven by God the
Father; and God the Holy Spirit is descending from heaven

"Father" and
Son;
drawn as they are from the family; the most familiar of
human institutions_
indicate very strongly the distinct personhood of both the
Father and the Son
When "the Holy Spirit" is
in the same expression and
on the same level
as the other two persons
it is hard [0 avoid the conclusion
that the Holy Spirit is also viewed as
person and of equal standing with the
Father and the Son.
When
realize that the
Testament authors generally use the name
"God" (Gk theos)
to refer t0 God the Father and the name
Lord" (Gk
kyrios) to refer to God the Son; then it is clear that there is another trinitarian
expression in
Corinthians 12.4-6: "Now there are varieties of gifts
but the
same Spirit; and there are varieties of service; but the same Lord; and there
are varieties of
but it is the same God who inspires them all in every

Similarly, the last verse of _
Corinthians
trinitarian in its
expression: "The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the
Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Cor: 13.14). We see the three persons
mentioned separately in Ephesians 4.4-6 as well:
There

Spirit; just as YOu were called to the one
that belongs
your call; one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all; who is above all

All three persons of the Trinity are mentioned
together in the opening
sentence of
Peter:
According to the foreknowledge of God the Father; by
the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, that YOu may obey Jesus Christ and be
sprinkled with his blood"
Peter 1.2

Thrce Statenients Sumnarize the Dihlical Teaching
In one sense the doctrine of the Trinity is
mystery that we will never be able
understand fully However; we can understand something of its truth by
summarizing the teaching of Scripture in three statements:
God is three persons.
2. Each person is fully God
3. There
one God_
The following section will develop each of these statements in more detail.
God Is Three Persons.
The fact that God
three persons means that the
Father is not the Son; they are distinct persons. It also means that the Father is
not the Holy Spirit, but that
are distinct persons
And
means that the
Son is not the Holy Spirit: These distinctions are seen in
number of the
passages quoted in the earlier section as well as
many additional New
Testament passages_
John 1.1-2 tells us: "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God
and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God_
The fact
that the
Word" (who is seen t0 be Christ in vV 9-18) is "with" God shows
distinction from God the Father: In John 17.24 (NIV), Jesus speaks to God the
Father abour
my glory; the glory you have given me because you loved me
before the creation of the world,
thus showing distinction of persons, sharing
of glory; and
relationship of love between the Father and the Son before the
world was created_
We are told that Jesus continues as ouT
High Priest and Advocate before God
the Father: "If any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father; Jesus
Christ the righteous'
John 2.1). Christ
the one who "is able for all time
save those who draw near [0 God through
since he always lives tO
make intercession for them" (Heb. 7.25). Yet
order
intercede tOr US
before God the Father; it is necessary that Christ be
person distinct from the
Father:
Moreover; the Father is not the Holy Spirit, and the Son is not the Holy Spirit:
they
him;
They are distinguished
severa
verses. Jesus says,;
But the Counselor; the
Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he
teach you all
things, and bring to your remembrance all that
have said to you" (John
14.26).
The Holy Spirit also prays or "intercedes
for Us (Rom: 8.27),
indicating
distinction between the Holy Spirit and God the Father to whom
the intercession
made.
Finally; the fact that the Son is not the Holy Spirit is also indicated in the
several trinitarian passages mentioned earlier; such as the Great Commission
(Matt: 28.19), and in passages that indicate that Christ went back to heaven
and then sent the Holy Spirit to the church: Jesus said, "It is
your advantage
that
g0 away; for if
do not g0 away; the Counselor will not come
you;
but if
g0,
will send him to
(John 16.7).
Some have questioned whether the Holy Spirit is indeed
distinct person,
rather than just the "power" or "force
of God ar work in the world. But the
New Testament evidence is quite clear and strong:
First are the several verses
mentioned earlier where the Holy Spirit is put in
coordinate relationship
with the Father and the Son (Matt_ 28.19;
Cor: 12.4-6;
Cor: 13.14; Eph:
4.4-6;
Peter 1:2): since the Father and Son are both persons
the coordinate
expression strongly intimates that the Holy Spirit is
person also_
Then there
are places where the masculine pronoun he (Gk: ekeinos) is applied to the
Holy Spirit (John 14.26; 15.26; 16.13-14), which one would not expect from
the rules of Greek grammar; for the word "spirit" (Gk: pneuma) is neuter; not
masculine
and would ordinarily be referred to with the neuter pronoun
ekeino. Moreover; the name counselor 0r comforter (Gk: parakletos) is
(erm
commonly used
speak of _
person who helps Or gives comfort Or counsel to
another person or persons_
but is used of the Holy Spirit in John' $ gospe
(14.16, 26; 15.26; 16.7).
Other persona
activities are ascribed t0 the
Spirit; such as teaching
(John 14.26), bearing witness (John 15.26; Rom. 8:16), interceding or praying
on behalf of others (Rom_
8.26-27
searching the depths of God (1 Cor:
2:10) , knowing the thoughts of God
Cor: 2:11), willing to distribute some
gifts t0 some and other gifts t0 others (1 Cor:
12.11) , forbidding Or not
allowing certain activities (Acts 16.6
speaking (Acts 8.29; 13.2; and many
times in both Old and
Testaments), evaluating and approving
wise
course of action (Acts 15.28) , and being grieved by sin in the lives of
Christians (Eph 4.30).
Finally; if the Holy Spirit is understood simply to be the power of God_
rather
than
distinct person, then
number of passages would simply not make
Will
you"
Holy
New
sense, because in them the Holy Spirit and his power or the power of God are
both mentioned. For example, Luke 4.14, "And Jesus retumed in the power of
the Spirit into Galilee
would have t0 mean;
Jesus returned in the power of
the power of God into Galilee
In Acts 10.38,
"God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power;;
would mean;
God anointed
Jesus with the power of God and with power'
(see also Rom. 15.13;
Cor:
2.4).
Although
s0 many passages clearly
distinguish the Holy Spirit from the other
members of the Trinity, one puzzling verse has been
Corinthians 3.17:
"Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
freedom:
Interpreters often assume that "the Lord" here must mean Christ;
because Paul
frequently uses "the Lord" tO refer to Christ. But that is
probably not the case here, for
good argument can be made from grammar
and context t0 say that this verse
better translated with the Holy Spirit as
subject;
the Spirit is the Lord.
In this case, Paul would be saying
that the Holy Spirit is also " Yahweh'
(or "Jehovah'
the Lord of the Old
Testament (note the clear Old Testament background of this context;
beginning at
Theologically this would be quite acceptable, for it could
truly be said that just as God the Father is "Lord" and God the Son is
Lord"
(in the full Old Testament sense of "Lord" as
name for God); s0 also the
Holy Spirit is the one called "Lord" in the Old Testament
and it is the Holy
Spirit who especially manifests the presence of the Lord t0 US in the new
covenant age
2. Each
Is Fully God
In addition t0 the fact that all three persons are
distinct; the abundant testimony of Scripture
that each person is fully God
as well
First; God the Father is clearly God. This is evident from the first verse of the
Bible, where God created the heaven and the earth
It is evident through the
Old and New Testaments_
where God the Father is clearly viewed as
sovereign Lord over all and where Jesus prays t0 his Father in heaven.
Next, the Son is fully God. Although this point will be developed in greater
detail in chapter 26, "The Person of Christ;
we can briefly note several
explicit passages at this point: John 1:1-4 clearly affirms the full deity of
Christ:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all
were
made through him; and without him was not
anything made that was
~Now -
Person
things
made_
In him was life_
and the life was the light of men:
Here Christ is referred t0 as "the Word;'
and John says both that he was
'with
God" and that he "was God:
The Greek text echoes the
opening words of
Genesis 1:1 ("In the
beginning
and reminds uS that John is
about
something that was true before the world was made_
God the Son was always
fully God:
The translation "the Word was God" has been challenged by the Jehovah's
Witnesses,
who translate it "the Word was
implying that the Word
was simply
heavenly
but not fully divine. They justify this translation
by pointing to the fact that the definite article (Gk ho_
"the'
does not occur
before the Greek word theos
God"Z
They say therefore that theos should be
translated
However; their interpretation has been followed by no
recognized Greek scholar anywhere
for it is commonly known that the
sentence follows
regular rule of Greek grammar; and the absence of the
definite article merely indicates that "God" is the predicate rather than the
subject of the sentence_
(A recent publication by the Jehovah's Witnesses
nOw
acknowledges the relevant grammatical
but continues t0 affirm their
position on John 1:1 nonetheless.
The inconsistency of the Jehovah's Witnesses
position can further be seen in
their translation of the rest of the chapter: For various other grammatical
reasons
the word theos also lacks the definite article
other places in this
chapter; such as verse
There was
man sent from God" ) verse 12
power to become children of God"
verse 13 ("but of God"_
and verse 18
("No one has ever seen God" ) If the Jehovah's Witnesses were consistent
with their argument about the absence of the definite article,
would have
translate all of these with the phrase
god;
but they translate
God" in
every case_
John 20.28 in its context is also
strong proof for the deity of Christ Thomas
had doubted the reports
the other disciples that they had seen Jesus raised
from the dead, and he said he would not believe unless he could see the
prints in Jesus' hands and place his hand in his wounded side (John 20.25).
Then Jesus appeared t0 the disciples when Thomas was with them. He said to
Thomas_
Put your
finger here, and see my hands-
and put out your hand, and
place it in my side; do not be faithless_
but believing
(John 20.27). In
response to this,
read, "Thomas answered him; 'My Lord and my God!'
(John 20.28)_
Here Thomas calls Jesus
my God.
The narrative shows that
both John in writing his gospel and Jesus himself approve of what Thomas
talking
god;
being
Lod

has said and encourage everyone who hears about Thomas tO believe the
same things that Thomas did. Jesus immediately responds to Thomas; "Have
you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen
and yet believe
(John 20.29). As far as John
concered, this is the
dramatic high point of the gospel, for he immediately tells the reader
in the
very next verse
that this was the reason he wrote it:
Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples;
which are not written in this book; but these are written that You may
believe that Jesus is the Christ; the Son of God, and that believing yOu
may have life in his name: (John 20.30-31)
Jesus speaks of those who will not see him and will yet believe
and John
immediately tells the reader that he recorded the events written in his gospel
in order that they may believe in just this way;
imitating Thomas in his
confession of faith: In other words_
the entire gospel is written t0 persuade
people to imitate
who sincerely called Jesus
Lord and my
God
Because this is set out by John as the purpose of his gospel, the
sentence takes on added force
Other passages speaking of Jesus as fully divine include Hebrews
where
the author says that Christ is the
exacl
representation
(Gk charakter;

of the nature or being (Gk hypostasis) of God
~meaning that God

the creation of the heavens to Christ when he says of him;

(Heb. 1:10, quoting Ps. 102.25). Titus 2.13 refers t0

and
Peter 1:1 speaks of "the righteousness of our God
and Savior Jesus Christ:
Romans 9.5
speaking of the Jewish people, says
"Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them
traced the human ancestry of
Christ; who is God over all, forever praised! Amen'

In the Old Testament; Isaiah 9:6 predicts,
"FOr [0 US

Thomas,

the similar application of the titles

of the Messiah in Isaiah 40.3, "In the wildemess prepare the way of
the LORD
make straight in the desert
highway for our God," quoted by John
the Baptist in
preparation for the coming of Christ in Matthew 3.3
Many other passages will be discussed in chapter 26 below; but these should
be sufficient t0 demonstrate that the New Testament clearly refers
Christ as
fully God:
As Paul says in Colossians 2.9, "In him the whole fulness of deity
dwells bodily:
Next; the Holy Spirit is also fully God. Once we understand God the Father
and God the Son to be fully God, then the trinitarian expressions in verses like
Matthew 28.19
"baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit") assume significance for the doctrine of the Holy Spirit;
because they show that the Holy Spirit is classified on an equal level with the
Father and the Son. This can be seen if we recognize how unthinkable it
would have been for Jesus t0 say
something like; "baptizing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the archangel Michael"
this would give
created being
status entirely inappropriate even to an archangel.
Believers throughout all ages can only be baptized into the name (and thus
into
taking on of the character) of God himself:
(Note also the other
trinitarian passages mentioned above:
Cor: 12.4-6; 2 Cor: 13.14; Eph 44
Peter 1.2; Jude 20-21.)
In Acts 5.3-4, Peter asks Ananias, "Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to
the Holy Spirit
You have not lied t0 men but t0 God.
According to
Peter' =
words_
to lie to the Holy Spirit is t0 lie t0 God. Paul says in
Corinthians 3.16, "Do you not know that you are God $ temple and that God $
Spirit dwells in
God s temple is the place where God himself dwells
which Paul explains by the fact that "God s Spirit" dwells in
thus
apparently equating God*s Spirit with God himself.
David asks in Psalm 139.7-8

whither shall
flee from your presence? If [ ascend t0 heaven, YOu are therel"
This passage attributes the divine characteristic of omnipresence

Spirit; something that is not true of any of God*s creatures:
It seems that
David is equating God's Spirit with God 's presence: To go from God s Spirit
is t0 go from his presence_
but if there is nowhere that David can flee from
God'$ Spirit, then he knows that wherever he goes he will have
say; "You
are there.
Paul attributes the divine characteristic of omniscience to the Holy Spirit in
Corinthians 2.10-11: "For the Spirit searches
everything; even the depths of
God: For what person knows

which is in
So also nO one

But the work of giving new

that only
God can do (cf:
John 3.9, "born of God") This passage therefore gives
another indication that the Holy Spirit is fully God.
Up to this point We have two conclusions, both abundantly taught throughout
Scripture:
God is three persons.
Each person is fully God_
If the Bible taught only these two facts, there would be no logical problem at
all in
them
together; for the obvious solution would be that there are
three Gods_
The Father is fully God, the Son is fully God, and the Holy Spirit
is fully God_
We would have
system where there are three equally divine
beings. Such
system of belief would be called polytheism
O1 , more
specifically; "tritheism;'
or belief in three Gods_
But that is far from what the
Bible teaches_
There Is One God. Scripture is abundantly clear that there is one and only
one God. The three different persons of the Trinity are one not only in
purpose and
agreement on what they think; but they are one in essence, one
in their essential nature:.

When Moses
"Who is like you,
LORD, among the gods?
Who is like YOu; majestic in holiness,
terrible in glorious deeds, doing wonders?" (Ex: 15.11)
the answer obviously is "No one.
God is unique; and there is no one like him
and there can be no one like him. In fact, Solomon prays "that all the peoples
of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is nO other" (1
8.60).
When God
he repeatedly makes it clear that he is the only true God;
the idea that there are three Gods to be worshiped rather than one would be
unthinkable in the light of these extremely strong statements.
God alone is the
one true God and there is no one like him When he speaks, he alone is
speaking
he is not speaking as one God among three who are
worshiped_
He says:
TTam the LORD, and there is nO other;
besides me there is no God;
you; though you do not know me,
that men may know; from the rising of the sun
and from the west; that there is none besides me;

(Isa. 45.5-6)
Similarly, he calls everyone on earth to turn t0 him:

The New Testament also affirms that there is one God. Paul writes_
For there
is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus"
Tim: 2.5).
Paul affirms that "God
one
(Rom: 3.30), and that
"there is one God
[he
Father; from whom are all things and for whom we
exist" (1 Cor: 8.6).
Finally James acknowledges that even demons

fact is not enough [0 save them:

Simplistic Solutions Must All Deny One Strand of Biblical Teaching:
We nOw have three statements_
all of which are taught in Scripture:
God is three persons.
Each person is fully God_
3. There
one God
Throughout the history of the church there have been attempts
come up
with
simple solution t0 the doctrine of the Trinity by denying one or another
of these statements. If someone denies the first statement; then we are simply
left with the fact that each of the persons named in Scripture (Father; Son, and
Holy Spirit) is God
and there is one God_
But if we do not have t0 say that
they are distinct persons, then there is an easy solution: these are just different
names for one person who acts differently at different times:
Sometimes this
person calls himself Father; sometimes he calls himself Son, and sometimes
he calls himself Spirit:
We have no difficulty in
understanding
for in
ouI own experience the same person can act at one time as
lawyer (for
example), at another time as
father t0 his own children; and at another time
son
with respect to his parents: The same person is
lawyer;
father; and
son.
But such
solution would
the fact that the three persons are
distinct individuals, that God the Father sends God the Son into the world,
that the Son prays
the
Father; and that the Holy Spirit intercedes before the
Father for uS.
You
that,
deny
Another simple solution might be found by denying the second statement; that
is, denying that some of the persons named in Scripture are really fully God_
If we simply hold that God
three persons
and that there is one God, then
we might be tempted to say that some of the
persons
in this one God are nOt
fully God, but are only subordinate 0r created
of God: This solution
would be taken, for example, by those who deny the
deity of the Son (and
of the Holy Spirit).
But, aS we saw above, this solution would have [0
an entire
category of biblical teaching:
Finally; as we noted above_
simple solution could come by denying that
there is one God. But this would result in
belief in three Gods_
something
clearly contraly t0 Scripture.
Though the third error has not been common, as we shall see below; each of
the first Iwo errors has appeared at one time or another in the history of the
church and they still persist today
some groups:
5. AlI Analogies Have Shortcomings
If we cannor
any of these simple
solutions, then how can we put the three truths of Scripture together and
maintain the doctrine of the Trinity? Sometimes people have used several
analogies drawn from nature or human experience tO attempt t0 explain this
doctrine. Although these analogies are helpful at an elementary level of
understanding; they all turn Out to be inadequate Or misleading on further
reflection. To say;, for example, that God is
three-leaf clover; which has
three parts yet remains one clover; fails because each leaf is only part of the
clover; and any one leaf cannot be said to be the whole clover: But in the
Trinity, each of the persons is not just
separate part ot God_
each person is
fully God
Moreover; the leaf of
clover is
impersonal and does not have
distinct and complex personality in the way each person of the Trinity does_
Others have used the analogy of
tree with three parts: the rOOts _
trunk, and
branches all constitute one tree
Buc
similar problem arises, for these are
only parts of
tree, and none of the parts can be said to be the whole tree
Moreover; in this analogy the parts have different properties, unlike the
persons of the
all of whom possess all of the attributes of God in
equal measure_
And the lack of personality in each part is
deficiency as
well.
The analogy of the three forms of water (steam, water; and ice) is also
inadequate because (a) no quantity of water is ever all three of these at the
same time_
they have different properties Or characteristics
(c) the

Trinity,
analogy
nothing
(there is no such
thing as
one water" or
all the water in the universe
and
(d) the element of intelligent personality is lacking
Other analogies have been drawn from human experience. It might be said
that the Trinity is
something like
man who is both
farmer; the mayor of his
town , and an elder in his church. He functions in different roles at different
times
but he is one man. However; this analogy is very deficient because
there is only one person
doing these three activities at different times_
and the
analogy cannot deal with the personal interaction among the members of the
Trinity. (In fact; this analogy simply teaches the heresy called modalism;
discussed below:)
Another
analogy taken from human life is the union of the intellect, the
emotions
and the will
one human person. While these are parts of
personality; however; no one factor constitutes the entire person_
And the
parts are not identical in characteristics but have different abilities.
So what analogy shall we use
teach the Trinity? Although the Bible uses
many analogies from nature and life tO teach us various aspects of God $
character (God is like
rock in his faithfulness, he is like
shepherd in his
care
etc.), it is interesting that Scripture nowhere uses any
analogies t0 teach
the doctrine of the Trinity. The closest we come t0 an
found in the
titles
Father" and "Son'
themselves, titles that clearly speak of distinct
persons and of the close relationship that exists between them in
human
family. But on the human level; of course _
have two entirely separate
human
nOl one
being comprised of three distinct persons_
It is best t0
conclude that no
adequately teaches about the Trinity; and all are
misleading in significant ways.
God Eternally and Necessarily Exists as the Trinity: When the universe
was created God the Father spoke the powerful creative words that brought it
into being; God the Son was the divine
who carried out these words
(John 1.3;
Cor: 8.6; Col: 1:16; Heb: 1.2) , and God the Holy Spirit was active
moving over the face of the waters"
(Gen. 1.2). So it is as we would expect:
if all three members of the Trinity are equally and fully divine, then they have
all three existed for all eternity; and God has eternally existed as
Trinity (cf.
also John 17.5, 24)
Moreover; God cannot be other than he is
for he is
unchanging

seems right to conclude that
God necessarily exists as
Trinity
he cannor be Other than he is
C.Errors Have Come By Denying
of the Three Statements
Summarizing the Biblical Teaching
analogy
beings,
analogy
agent
Any
In the previous section
we saw how the Bible requires that we affirm the
following three statements:
1. God is three persons.
Each person is fully God_
There
one God_
Before
discuss further the differences between the Father; Son, and Holy
Spirit; and the way they relate tO one another; it is important that we recall
some of the doctrina)
errors about the Trinity that have been made in the
history of the church: In this historical survey we will see some of the
mistakes that
ourselves should avoid in any further thinking about this
doctrine. In fact; the major trinitarian errors that have arisen have come
through
denial of one or another of these three primary statements_
Modalism Claims That There Is One Person Who Appears to Us in
Three Different Forms (or "Modes" ) At various times people have taught
that God is not really three distinct persons, but only one person who appears
people
different
modes
at different times. For example
the Old
Testament God appeared as "Father:
Throughout the Gospels; this same
divine person appeared as "the Son" as seen in the human life and ministry of
Jesus. After Pentecost; this same person then revealed himself as the
Spirit"
active in the church:
This
is also referred to by two other names_
Sometimes it is called
Sabellianism, after
teacher named Sabellius who lived in Rome in the early
third century AD_
Another term for modalism is
modalistic
monarchianism;
because this
not only says that God revealed
himself
different
modes
but it also says that there is only one supreme
ruler
monarch") in the universe and that is God himself; who consists of
only one person.
Modalism gains its attractiveness from the desire to emphasize clearly the fact
that there is only one God_
It may claim
support not only from the passages
about one God
but also from passages such as John 10.30 ( [ and the
Father are one
and John 14.9 ("He who has seen me has seen the Father"
However; the last passage can simply mean that Jesus fully reveals the
character of God the Father; and the former passage (John 10.30), in
context
in which Jesus affirms that he will accomplish all that the Father has given
him
do and save all whom the Father has given to him, seems
mean thal
teaching
teaching
talking :
Jesus and the Father are one in purpose.
The fatal shortcoming of modalism is the fact that
must deny the personal
relationships within the Trinity that appear in S0 many places in Scripture (0r
it must affirm that these were simply an illusion and not real):
Thus, it must
deny three separate persons at the baptism of Jesus_
where the Father speaks
heaven and the Spirit descends on Jesus like
dove. And
must say that
all those instances where Jesus
praying t0 the Father are an illusion or
charade. The idea of the Son or the Holy Spirit interceding for us before God
the Father is
ost. Finally, modalism ultimately loses the heart of the doctrine
of the atonement
that is, the idea that God sent his Son as
substitutionary
sacrifice_
and that the Son bore the wrath of God in our place, and that the
Father; representing the interests of the Trinity; saw the suffering of Christ and
Wds
satisfied (Isa. 53.11).
Moreover; modalism denies the independence of God_
for if God is only one
person, then he has no ability t0 love and to communicate without other
persons in his creation. Therefore it was necessary for God to create the
world, and God would no longer be independent of creation (see chapter 12,
above; on God $ independence):
One present denomination within Protestantism (broadly defined), the United
Pentecostal Church, is modalistic in its doctrinal position_
2. Arianism Denies the Full Deity of the Son and the Holy Spirit
The Arian Controversy: The term Arianism is derived
Arius_
Bishop of Alexandria whose views were condemned at the Council of Nicea
in AD. 325
and who died in AD. 336_
Arius taught that God the Son was at
one
point created by God the Father; and that before that time the Son did not
exist, nor did the Holy Spirit, but the Father only. Thus, though the Son is
heavenly being who existed before the rest of creation and who is far greater
than all the rest of creation; he is still not equal t0 the Father in all his
attributes
he may even be said t0 be "like the Father" or "similar t0 the
Father" in his nature; but he cannot be said t0 be "of the same nature
as the
Father:
The Arians depended heavily on texts that called Christ God' $
only
begotten
Son (John 1.14; 3.16,
John 4.9). If Christ were "begotten
God the Father;
reasoned_
must mean that he was brought into
existence by God the Father (for the word "beget" in human experience refers
tO the father's role in conceiving
child) Further support for the Arian view
from
from
they
was found in Colossians 1:15, "He
the image of the invisible God, the first-
born of all creation
Does not "first-born'
here imply that the Son was at
some
point brought into existence by the Father?
And if this is tnuue of the
Son;
must necessarily be true of the Holy Spirit as well.
But these texts do not require US t0 believe the Arian position. Colossians
1.15, which calls Christ "the first-born of all creation;
better understood [0
mean that Christ has the rights or privileges of the "first-born"
-that is;
according to biblical
usage and custom, the right of leadership or authority in
the family for one
generation: (Note Heb. 12:16 where Esau is said to have
sold his "first-bom starus
or "birthright"
the Greek word prototokia is
cognate
the term prototokos, "first-born'
in Col: 1.15.) So Colossians 1:15
means that Christ has the privileges of authority and rule
the privileges
belonging to the "first-born;
but with respect to the whole creation. The NIV
translates it helpfully; "the firstborn over all creation:
As for the texts that say that Christ was God $
only begotten Son;
the early
church felt so strongly the force of many other texts
that Christ was
fully and completely God, that it concluded that; whatever
only begotten"
meant; it did not mean
crealed_
Therefore the Nicene Creed in 325 affirmed
that Christ was
"begotten;
made
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible
and invisible_
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father;
the only-
begotten; that is, of the essence of the Father; God of God,
Light of Light; very God of
God, begotten, not made, being of
one substance (homoousion) with the Father:
This same phrase was reaffirmed at the Council of Constantinople in 381_
addition
the phrase "before all ages"'
Was
added after "begotten of the
Father;
to show that this "begetting
was etemal: It never
began
happen,
but is
something that has been eternally true of the relationship berween the
Father and the Son. However; the nature of that "begetting
has never been
defined very clearly; other than to say that it has tO do with the relationship
between the Father and the Son, and that
some sense the Father has
etemally had
primacy
that relationship_
In further repudiation of the
of Arius; the Nicene Creed insisted that
Christ was
'of the same substance as the Father:
The dispute with Arius
concerned tWO words that have become famous in the history ot Christian
showing
very
teaching
doctrine, homoousios
"of the same nature'
and homoiousios
"of =
similar
nature
The difference depends on the different meaning of two Greek
prefixes_
homo
same_
and homoi-, meaning "similar " Arius was
happy
say that Christ was
superatural heavenly being and that he was
created by God before the creation of the rest of the universe, and even that he
was
similar" t0 God in his nature
Thus
Arius would agree t0 the word
homoiousios_
But the Council of Nicea in 325 and the Council of
Constantinople in 381 realized that this did not go far enough, for if Christ is
not of exactly the same nature as the Father; then he is not fully God. So both
councils insisted that orthodox Christians confess Jesus to be homoousios, of
the same nature as God the Father: The difference between the tWo words was
only one letter; the Greek letter iota_
and some have criticized the church for
allowing
doctrinal dispute over
single letter to consume S0 much attention
for most of the fourth century AD_
Some have wondered,
Could
anything be
foolish than arguing over
single letter
word?" But the difference
between the two words was profound, and the presence 0r absence of the iota
really did mark the difference between biblical
Christianity, with _
true
doctrine of the Trinity; and
heresy that did not accept the full deity of Christ
and therefore was nontrinitarian and ultimately destructive t0 the whole
Christian faith:
b: Subordinationism: In
affirming that the Son was of the same nature as the
Father; the early church also excluded
related false doctrine_
subordinationism
While Arianism held that the Son was created and was not
divine , subordinationism held that the Son was eternal (nor created) and
divine,
but still not equal to the Father in being or attributes
the Son was
inferior 0r

[0 God the Father:
The early church father
Origen (c. 185-€
A.DJ
254) advocated
form of subordinationism by
that the Son was inferior t0 the Father in being; and that the Son eternally
derives his being from the Father: Origen was attempting to protect the
distinction of persons and was
before the doctrine of the Trinity was
clearly formulated in the church The rest of the church did not follow him but
clearly rejected his
teaching at the Council of Nicea
Although many early church leaders contributed tO the
formulation of
correct doctrine of the Trinity; the most influential by far was Athanasius.
He was only twenty-nine years old when he came t0 the Council of Nicea in
A.D. 325,not as an official member but as secretary t0 Alexander; the Bishop
of Alexandria.
Yet his keen mind and
ability allowed him t0 have an
important
influence on the outcome of the Council, and he himself became
Bishop of Alexandria in 328. Though the Arians had been condemned at

but; by his
efforts

Athanasius saved the Church from pagan intellectualism:
The

himself, but it is
very clear affirmation of trinitarian doctrine that gained
increasing
in the church from about A.D. 400 onward and
still used in
Protestant and Catholic churches today: (See appendix !
Adoptionism: Before we leave the discussion of Arianism, one related
false
teaching needs to be mentioned.
Adoptionism" is the view that Jesus
lived as an
ordinary man until his baptism, but then God
adopted" Jesus as
his "Son'
and conferred on him supernatural powers. Adoptionists would not
hold that Christ existed before he was born as
man; therefore
would
not think of Christ as eternal, nor would
think of him as the exalted,
supernatural being created by God that the Arians held him to be_
Even after

Son"
of God, they would not think of him as divine
in nature_
but only as an exalted man whom God called his "Son" in
unique
sense:
Adoptionism never gained the force
movement in the way Arianism did,
but there were people who held adoptionist views from time tO time in the
early church, though their views were never accepted as orthodox
Many
modern people who think of Jesus as
great man and someone especially
empowered by God, but not really divine
would fall into the adoptionist
category: We have placed it here in relation to Arianism because it, tOo_
denies
the deity of the Son (and, similarly; the deicy of the Holy Spirit)
The controversy over Arianism was drawn t0
close by the Council of
Constantinople in AD 381_
This council reaffirmed the Nicene statements
and added
statement on the deity of the Holy Spirit, which had come under
attack in the period since Nicea_
After the phrase;
And in the Holy Spirit;
Constantinople added, "the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the
Father; who with the Father and the Son together is
worshipped and glorified;
who spake by the Prophets_
The version of the creed that includes the
additions at Constantinople is what is commonly known as the Nicene Creed
(See
1169 for the text of the Nicene Creed )

unfortunate chapter in the history of the church should be briefly noted,
namely the controversy over the insertion of the filioque clause into the
Nicene Creed
an insertion that eventually led to the split between western
(Roman Catholic) Christianity and easter Christianity (consisting today of
various branches of eastern orthodox Christianity; such as the Greek Orthodox
Church; the Russian Orthodox Church; etc ) in AD. 1054
The word filioque is
Latin term that means
and from the Son:
It was not
included in the Nicene Creed in either the firSt version of A.D. 325 0r the
second version of AD: 381. Those versions simply said that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father:
But in AD. 589, at
regional church council in
Toledo (in what is now Spain), the phrase "and the Son'
was added, so that
the creed then said that the
Spirit
proceeds from the Father and the Son
(filioque).
In the light of John 15.26 and 16.7
where Jesus said that he
would send the Holy Spirit into the world, it seems there could be no
objection

Creed that had this additional phrase

received an official endorsement in AD_

The entire controversy was
complicated by ecclesiastical politics and struggles for power; and this
apparently very insignificant doctrinal point was the main doctrinal issue in
the split berween eastern and western Christianity in AD. 1054. (The
underlying politica

the eastern formulation runs the danger of suggesting an unnatural distance
between the Son and the Holy Spirit; leading to the possibility that even in
personal worship an emphasis 0n more mystical, Spirit-inspired experience
might be pursued to the neglect of an accompanying rationally understandable
adoration of Christ as Lord. Nevertheless, the controversy was ultimately over
such an obscure point of doctrine (essentially; the relationship between the
Son and Spirit before creation) that it certainly did not warrant division in the
church:
The Importance of the Doctrine of the Trinity: Why was the church s0
concerned about the doctrine of the Trinity? Is it really essential to hold to the
full deity of the Son and the Holy Spirit? Yes it is, for this
has
implications for the
heart of the Christian faith First, the atonement is at
stake. If Jesus is merely
created being; and not fully God_
then it is hard t0
see how he;
creature, could bear the full wrath of God
all of our sins_
Could any creature,
matter how great; really save us? Second, justification
by faith alone
threatened if we deny the full deity of the Son_
(This is seen
today in the
of the Jehovah's Witnesses
who do not believe in
justification by faith alone.
If Jesus is not fully God, we would rightly doubt
whether we can really trust him t0 save uS completely. Could we really
depend on any creature fully for our salvation? Third, if Jesus is not infinite
God
should we pray to him or worship him? Who but an infinite _
omniscient
God could hear and respond t0 all the prayers of all God' $ people? And who
but God himself is worthy of worship? Indeed, if Jesus is merely
creature _
no matter how great, it would be idolatry t0 worship him
yet the New
Testament commands us to do so (Phil. 2.9-1; Rev: 5.12-14).
Fourth, if
someone teaches that Christ was
created being but nonetheless one who
saved uS_
then this teaching wrongly begins t0 attribute credit for salvation to
creature and not t0 God himself: But this wrongfully exalts the creature
rather than the Creator;
something Scripture never allows US to do.
Fifth, the
independence and personal nature of God are at stake: If there is no Trinity,
then there were no interpersonal relationships within the being of God before
creation, and_
without personal relationships_
it is difficult to see how God
could be genuinely personal 0r be without the need for a creation t0 relate t0
Sixth, the unity of the universe is at stake: If there
not perfect
plurality and
perfect unity in God himself; then we have no basis for
there can be
any ultimate unity among the diverse elements of the universe either: Clearly;
in the doctrine of the Trinity; the heart of the Christian faith is at stake_
Herman Bavinck says that
Athanasius understood better than any of his
contemporaries that Christianity stands 0r falls with the confession of the
deity of Christ and of the Trinity
He adds,
In the confession of the Trinity

throbs the heart of the Christian religion: every error results from; or upon
deeper reflection may be traced t0_
wrong view of this doctrine_
Tritheism Denies That There Is Only One God:
A final possible way t0
attempt an easy reconciliation of the biblical teaching about the Trinity would
deny that there
only one God_
The result is t0 say that God is three
persons and each person is fully God_
Therefore
there are three Gods_
Technically this view would be called "tritheism_
Few persons have held this view
the history of the church
It has
similarities to many ancient pagan religions that held to
multiplicity of
This view would result in confusion in the minds of believers- There would be
no absolute worship or loyalty 0r devotion t0 one true God
We would wonder
which God we should give our ultimate allegiance_
And;
deeper level,
this view would destroy any sense of ultimate unity in the universe: even in
the very being of God there
be plurality but no unity
Although no modern groups advocate tritheism, perhaps many evangelicals
today unintentionally tend toward tritheistic views of the Trinity, recognizing
the distinct
personhood of the Father; the Son; and the Holy Spirit, but seldom
being aware of the unity of God as one undivided being:
What Are

After completing this survey of errors concerning the Trinity; we may nOw g0
on t0 ask if anything more
be said about the distinctions between the
Father; Son, and Holy Spirit: If we say that each member of the Trinity is fully
God
and that each person fully shares in all the attributes of God, then is
there any difference at all among the persons? We cannot say; for example;
that the Father is more powerful 0r wiser than the Son, or that the Father and
Son are wiser than the Holy Spirit; or that the Father existed before the Son
and
Spirit existed_
for tO say anything like that would be [0
the full
deity of all three members
the Trinity. But what then are the distinctions
between the persons?
1. The Persons of the Trinity Have Different Primary Functions in
Relating to the World:
When Scripture discusses the way in which God
relates t0 the world
both in creation and in redemption_
the persons of the
Trinity are said to have different functions Or primary activities_
Sometimes
this has been called the
economy of the Trinity;
using economy in an old
sense meaning "ordering of activities_
(In this sense, people used to speak of
the
economy of
household" or "home economics;
not just the
gods
would
Holy
deny
meaning
financial affairs of
household, but all of the "ordering of activities" within
the household ) The
economy of the Trinity" means the different ways the
three persons act as they relate to the world and (as we shall see in the next
section) t0 each other for all eternity.
We see these different functions in the work of creation. God the Father spoke
the creative words to bring the universe into being: But
was God the Son,
the eternal Word of God, who carried out these creative decrees
were made through him; and without him was not anything made that was
made
(John 1.3). Moreover; "in him all
Kyere
crealed,
in heaven and
0n earth
visible and invisible,
whether thrones or dominions or principalities
authorities
were created through him and for him'
(Col. 1:16;
see also Ps. 33.6,9;
Cor: 8.6; Heb 1.2). The
Spirit was active as well
in a different way; in "moving
hovering
over the face of the waters
(Gen. 1:2) , apparently sustaining and manifesting God $ immediate presence
in his creation (cf. Ps. 33.6_
where "breath'
should perhaps be translated
"Spirir"=
see also Ps. 139.7).
In the work of redemption there are also distinct functions_
God the Father
planned redemption and sent his Son
the world (John 3.16; Gal. 44; Eph
1.9-10). The Son obeyed the Father and accomplished redemption for uS
(John 6.38; Heb
10.5-7; et al.) God the Father did not come and die for our
sins
nor did God the Holy Spirit: That was the particular work of the Son:
after Jesus ascended back into heaven, the Holy Spirit was sent by the
Father and the Son to apply redemption to uS _
Jesus speaks of "the
Spirit; whom the Father will send in my name
(John 14.26), but also says
that he himself
send the Holy Spirit, for he says, "If [ g0,
will send him
you"
(John 16.7), and he speaks of
time "when the Counselor comes,
whom
shall send to yOu from the Father; even the Spirit of truth" (John
15.26). It is especially the role of the Holy Spirit t0 give US regeneration or
new spiritual life (John 3.5-8), to sanctify us (Rom. 8.13; 15.16;
Peter 1.2),
and t0 empower uS for service (Acts 1.8;
Cor: 12.7-11). In general, the
work of the Holy Spirit seems to be to bring
completion the work that has
been planned by God the Father and begun by God the Son. (See chapter 30,
on the work of the Holy Spirit )
So we may say that the role of the Father in creation and redemption has been
plan and direct and send the Son and Holy Spirit This is not surprising; for
it shows that the Father and the Son relate tO one another as
tather and son
relate
one another in
human family: the father directs and has authority
over the son, and the son
and is responsive t0 the directions of the
father: The Holy Spirit is obedient t0 the directives of both the Father and the
things
things

Holy
into
Then,

Son.
Thus, while the persons of the Trinicy are
in all their attributes_
they
nonetheless differ in their relationships to the creation. The Son and Holy
Spirit are equal in deity to God the Father; but
are subordinate in their
roles.
Moreover; these differences in role are not temporary but will last forever:
Paul tells us that even after the final judgment; when the "last enemy;
that is,
death, is destroyed and when all
are put under Christ'$ feet; "then the
Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all
under him, that
God may be everything
every one
(1 Cor: 15.28).
2. The
of the Trinity Eternally Existed as Father; Son, and Holy
Spirit: But why do the persons of the Trinity take these different roles in
relating to creation? Was it accidental or arbitrary? Could God the Father have
come instead of God the Son t0 die for Our sins? Could the Holy Spirit have
sent God the Father t0 die fOr our sins_
and then sent God the Son to apply
redemption t0 Us?
No, it does not seem that these things could have happened, for the role of
commanding; directing, and sending
appropriate t0 the position of the
Father; after whom all human fatherhood
patterned (Eph: 3.14-15). And the
role of obeying; going as the Father sends_
and
revealing God to us is
appropriate 0 the role of the Son, who is also called the Word of God (cf:
John 1.1-5,
14, 18; 17*4; Phil. 25-11). These roles could not have been
reversed 0r the Father would have ceased t0 be the Father and the Son would
have ceased to be the Son_
And by analogy from that relationship, we may
conclude that the role of the Holy Spirit is similarly one that was appropriate
to the relationship he had with the Father and the Son before the world was
crealed:
Second
before the Son came
earth, and even before the world was created,
for all eternity the Father has been the Father; the Son has been the Son; and
the
Spirit has been the Holy Spirit: These relationships are eternal, not
something that occured only in time_
We may conclude this first from the
unchangeableness of God (see chapter Ll): if God nOw exists as Father;
and Holy Spirit; then he has always existed as Father; Son, and Holy Spirit:
We may also conclude that the relationships are eternal from other verses
Scripture that speak of the relationships the members of the Trinity had to one
another before the creation of the world_
For instance
when Scripture speaks
of God $ work of election (see chapteL 32) before the creation of the world, it
equal
they
things
things
Persons
Holy
Son,
speaks of the Father choosing us "in" the Son:
Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
he chose US in him before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Eph: 1.3-4)_
The initiatory act of choosing is attributed t0 God the Father; who regards US
as united
Christ or "in Christ" before we ever existed_
Similarly, of God the
Father;
said that "those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be
conformed t0 the image of his Son" (Rom. 8.29).
We also read of the
"foreknowledge of God the Father" in distinction from particular functions of
the other two members of the Trinity
Peter 1.2 NASB; cf: 1.20).
Even the
fact that the Father
gave his only Son'
(John 3.16) and
sent the Son into the
world" (John 317) indicate that there was
Father-Son relationship before
Christ came into the world: The Son did not become the Son when the Father
sent him into the world. Rather; the great love of God is shown in the fact that
the one who was always Father gave the one who was always his only Son:
"For God s0 loved the world that he
his only Son
(John 3.16). "But
when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son"
(Gal. 4.4).
When Scripture
of creation, once again it
of the Father
through the Son, indicating
relationship prior to when creation began (see
John 1.3;
Cor: 8.6; Heb: 1.2; also Prov 8.22-31). But nowhere does
say
that the Son or Holy Spirit created through the Father: These passages
imply that there was
relationship of Father (as originator) and Son (as active
agent) before creation, and that this relationship made it appropriate for the
different persons of the Trinity t0 fulfill the roles they actually did fulfill
Therefore_
the different functions that we see the Father; Son, and
Spirit
performing are simply outworkings of an eternal relationship between the
three persons_
one that has
always existed and will exist for eternity. God has
always existed as three distinct persons: Father; Son
and Holy Spirit: These
distinctions are essential t0 the very nature of God himself; and they could not
be otherwise.
Finally; it may be said that there are no differences in deity, attributes_
essential nature between the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit: Each person is fully
God and has all the attributes of God_
The only distinctions between the
members of the Trinity are in the ways they relate t0 each other and to the rest
of creation. In those relationships they carry Out roles that are appropriate to
each person:
This truth about the Trinity has sometimes been summarized in the phrase

where the word

Another way of expressing this more simply
would be t0 say

Both
this
phrase are necessary t0
tnue doctrine of the Trinity: If we do not have
ontological equality; not all the persons are fully God_
But if we do not have
economic subordination;
then there is no inherent difference in the way the
three persons relate
one
another; and consequently we do not have the three
distinct persons existing as Father; Son, and
Spirit for all eternity. For
example, if the Son is not eternally subordinate
the Father in role, then the
Father is not eternally
Father " and the Son is not eternally "Son.
This would
mean thar the
Trinity has not eternally existed.
This
why the idea of eternal equality in being but subordination in role has
been essential t0 the church'
doctrine of the Trinity since
was first affirmed
in the Nicene Creed_
which said that the Son was
"begotten of the Father
before all
and that the Holy Spirit
'proceeds from the Father and the
Son.
Surprisingly; some recent evangelical writings have denied an eternal
subordination in role among the members of the Trinity;
but it has clearly
been part of the church's doctrine of the Trinity (in Catholic; Protestant; and
Orthodox expressions), at least since Nicea (AD 325). So Charles Hodge
says:
The Nicene doctrine includes_
the principle of the subordination of
the Son to the Father; and of the Spirit to the Father and the Son_
But
this subordination does not imply inferiority
The subordination
intended is only that which concerns the mode of subsistence and
operation:
The creeds are

facts of Scripture which concern the doctrine of the Trinity.
assert the distinct personality of the Father; Son
and Spirit
and
their consequent perfect equality; and the subordination of the Son t0
the Father; and of the Spirit to the Father and the Son; as t0 the mode
ot subsistence and operation_
These are scriptural facts _
t0 which the
creeds in question add
and it is
this sense they have been
accepted by the Church universal.
Similarly; A. H: Strong says:
Father; Son, and Holy Spirit, while equal in essence and dignity; stand
each other in an order of personality, office_

The subordination of the person of the Son t0 the person of the
Father; or in other words an order of personality; office, and operation
which permits the Father to be officially first, the Son second, and the
Spirit third, is perfectly consistent with equality. Priority is not
necessarily superiority.
We frankly recognize an eternal
subordination of Christ [0 the Father; but we maintain at the same
time that this subordination is
subordination of order; office; and
operation, nOL
subordination of essence.
What Is the Relationship Between the Three Persons and the
God? After the
preceding discussion; the question that remains unresolved is,
What is the difference between
person'
and "being" in this discussion? How
can we say that God is one undivided being; yet that in this one being there
are three persons?
First; it is important [0 affirm that each person is completely and fully God;
that is_
that each person has the whole fullness of God's being in himself: The
Son is not partly God 0r just one-third of God, but the Son is wholly and fully
God
and S0 is the Father and the
Spirit Thus, it would not be right to
think of the Trinity according t0 figure 14.1, with each person representing
only one-third of God's being:
Rather;
we muSt say that the person of the Father possesses the whole being of
God in himself Similarly; the Son possesses the whole being of God in
himself; and the Holy Spirit possesses the whole being of God in himself:
When we speak of the Father; Son
and Holy Spirit together we are not
speaking of any greater being than when we speak of the Father alone
or the

the Holy Spirit alone. The Father is all of God's being: The Son

another of the Son: and another of the Holy Spirit. But the Godhead of

should not think that the personal distinctions are any kind of additional

What then are the differences between Father; Son, and

no difference in attributes at all: The only difference between them is the way
they relate

While the three diagrams given above represented erroneous ideas to be
avoided
the
following diagram may be helpful in thinking about the existence
of three persons in the one undivided being of God_
In this diagram; the Father is represented as the section of the circle
designated by F; and also the rest of the circle, moving around clockwise from
the letter F; the Son is represented as the section of the circle designated by 5_
and also the rest of the circle, moving around clockwise from the letter 5; and
the Holy Spirit is represented as the section of the circle marked HS and also
the rest of the circle, moving around clockwise from the HS. Thus

Our own human personalities provide another faint analogy that can provide
some help in thinking about the Trinity:
man can think about different
objects outside of himself; and when he does this he

He can also think about himself; and then he is the object who is

but thoughts that he as
subject has about himself as an object: When this
happens
the subject; object; and thoughts are three distinct things. Yet each
thing in _
way includes his whole being: All of the man is the subject; and all
of the man is the object; and the thoughts (though in
lesser sense) are
thoughts about all of himself as
person:
But if the
unfolding of human personality allows this kind of complexity, then
the
unfolding of God's personality must allow for far greater complexity than
this. Within the one being of God the "unfolding'
of personality must allow
for the existence of three distinct persons, while each person still has the
whole of God $
in himself:
The difference in persons must be one of
relationship, not one of being
and yet each person must really exist: This tri-

Christian theology has come to use the word person

not because we fully understand what is
meant by the word person when referring t0 the Trinity; but rather so that we
might say something instead of saying
at all.
Can We Understand the Doctrine of the Trinity? We should be wamed
by the errors that have been made in the
They have all come about
through attempts to simplify the doctrine of the Trinity and make it
completely understandable, removing all mystery from it: This we can never
However;
is not correct t0 say that we cannot understand the doctrine of
the Trinity at all. Certainly
we can understand and know that God is three
persons
and that each person is fully God, and that there is one God. We can
know these things because the Bible teaches them. Moreover; we
know
some things about the way in which the persons relate t0 each other (see the
section above) But what we cannot understand fully is how t0 fit

those distinct biblical teachings_
We wonder how there can be three distinct

is spiritually healthy for us to acknowledge openly that God'$ very
far greater than we can ever comprehend. This humbles us before God and
draws US [0 worship him without reservation:
But it should also be said that Scripture does not ask us t0 believe in a
contradiction
A contradiction would be

one God,
or "God is three persons and God is not three persons

manifestation; but unintelligible in its essential nature_

Berkhof also says_
"It is especially when we reflect on the relation of the three

analogies fail us and we become deeply
conscious of the fact that the Trinity is
mystery far beyond our
comprehension. It is the incomprehensible glory of the Godhead_
Anolicaticn
Because God in himself has both unity and diversity;
is not surprising that
unity and diversity are also reflected in the human relationships he has
established_
We see this first in marriage
When God created man in his own
image; he did not create merely isolated individuals; but Scripture tells uS,
male and female he created them" (Gen. 1.27). And in the unity of marriage
(see Gen: 2.24) we see
noc
triunity as with God, but at least
remarkable
unity of two persons_
persons who remain distinct individuals yet also become
one in body; mind, and spirit (cf:
Cor: 6.16-20; Eph: 5.31). In fact; in the
relationship between man and woman in marriage we see also
picture of the
relationship between the Father and Son in the Trinity. Paul says _
"But
want
You [0
understand that the head of every man
Christ; the head of
woman
is her husband
and the head of Christ is God"
Cor: 11.3). Here;
as the
Father has authority over the Son in the Trinity, so the husband has authority
over the wife in marriage. The husband'
role is parallel to that of God the
Father and the wife $ role is parallel to that of God the Son
Moreover; just as
Father and Son are equal in deity and importance and personhood, s0 the
husband and wife are equal in humanity and importance and personhood:
And, although it is not explicitly mentioned in Scripture
the gift of children
within marriage, coming from both the father and the mother; and subject t0
the authority of both father and mother; is analogous to the relationship of the
Holy Spirit to the Father and Son in the Trinity.
But the human family is not the only way in which God has ordained that
there would be both diversity and unity in the world that reflect
something of
his Own excellence: In the church we have "many members
yet
one body"
Cor: 12.12). Paul reflects on the great diversity among members of the
human body
Cor: 12.14-26) and says that the church is like that: We have
many different members in our churches with different gifts and interests_
and
we depend on and help each other; thereby demonstrating
diversity and
unity at the same time:
When we
different people doing many
different
in the life of
church we ought to thank God that this allows
uS t0 glorify him by
reflecting something of the unity and diversity of the
Trinity:
oft.
juSL
great
great
things
We should also notice that God'
purpose in the
history of the universe has
frequently been to display unity in diversity; and thus t0 display his glory: We
see this not only in the diversity of
in the church (1 Cor: 12.12-26), but
also in the unity of Jews and Gentiles, so that all races; diverse as they are, are
united in Christ (Eph 2.16; 38-10; see also Rev 7.9)_
Paul is amazed that
God'$ plans for the history of redemption have been like
great symphony so
that his wisdom is beyond
out (Rom: 11.33-36). Even in the
mysterious unity between Christ and the church; in which we are called the
bride of Christ (Eph: 5.31-32) , we see unity beyond what we ever would have
imagined, unity with the Son of God himself Yet in all this we never lose OUT
individual identity but remain distinct persons always able to worship and
serve God as unique individuals_
Eventually the entire universe will partake of this unity of purpose with every
diverse part
contributing
the worship of God the Father; Son, and Holy
Spirit; for one day; at the name of Jesus every knee will bow "in heaven and
earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, t0 the
glory of God the Father" (Phil 2.10-11)
On
more everyday level, there are many activities that we cany out as
human beings (in the labor force, in social organizations,
musical
performances_
and in athletic teams_
for example) in which many distinct
individuals contribute t0
unity of purpose 0r activity. As we see
these
activities
reflection of the wisdom of God in allowing us both unity and
diversity; we can see
faint reflection of the glory of God in his trinitarian
existence:
Though
will never fully comprehend the mystery of the Trinity;
we can worship God for who he is both in Our songs of praise_
and in our
words and actions as they reflect something of his excellent character:
QUESTIONS FOR
PERSONAL
APPLICATION
Why is God pleased when people exhibit faithfulness, love; and harmony
within
family? What are some ways in which members of your family
reflect the diversity found in the members of the Trinity? How does your
family reflect the unity found among members of the Trinity? What are
suME
ways
which your family relationships could reflect the unity of
the Trinity more fully? How might the diversity of persons in the Trinity
encourage parents to allow their children to develop different interests
from each other; and from their parents
without thinking that the unity
of the family will be damaged?
Have YOu ever thought that
your church allows new or different kinds
of ministries t0 develop_
(hat
might hinder the unity of the church? Or
have you thought that encouraging people t0 use other gifts for ministry
gilts
finding '
than those that have been used in the past might be divisive in the
church?
might the fact of unity and diversity in the Trinity help you
approach those questions?
Do you think that the trinitarian nature of God is more fully reflected in a
church in which all the members have the same racial background
one in which the members come from many different races (see Eph:
3.1-10)?
In addition
our relationships within our families,
all exist in other
relationships to human authority in government, in employment, in
voluntary societies
in educational institutions
and in athletics

example:
Sometimes we have authority over others, and sometimes we
are subject t0 the
authority of others_
Whether in the family or one of
these other areas, give one example of
way in which your use of
authority Or YOur response t0 authority might become more like the
pattem of relationships in the Trinity:
If we see the trinitarian existence of God as the fundamental basis for all
combinations of unity and diversity in the universe, then what are some
other parts of creation that show both unity and diversity (for example:
the interdependency of environmental systems on the earth; or the
fascinating activity of bees
hive
the harmonious working of the
various parts of the human body)? Do you think God has made us s0 that
take spontaneous delight in demonstrations of unity in diversity; such
musical composition that manifests great unity and yet great
diversity of various parts at the same time, Or in the skillful execution of
some
planned strategy by members of an athletic team
together?
In the being of God we have infinite unity combined with the
preservation of distinct personalities belonging to the members of the
Trinity. How can this fact reassure US if we
begin [O fear that
becoming
more united to Christ as we grow in the Christian life (or
becoming more united to one another in the church) might tend to
obliterate our individual personalities? In heaven, do you think you
be exactly like everyone else_

personality that is
distinctly your own? How do eastern religions (such as Buddhism) differ

Chapter 15
Creation
Why;
and when did God create the universe?
EXPLANATION AND
SCRIP TURAL
BASIS
How did God create the world? Did he create every different kind of plant and
animal directly; or did he use some kind of evolutionary process, guiding the
development 0f
things from the simplest tO the most complex? And
how
quickly did God bring about creation? Was
all completed within six
twenty-four-hour
or did he use thousands or perhaps millions of years?
How old is the earth; and how old is the human race?
These questions face uS When
deal with the doctrine of creation Unlike
most of the earlier material in this book; this chapter treats several questions
on which
evangelical Christians have differing viewpoints, sometimes very
strongly held ones:
This chapter is
organized to move from those aspects of creation that are mOSt
clearly taught in Scripture, and on which almost all evangelicals would agree
(creation out of
nothing; special creation of Adam and Eve; and the goodness
of the universe), to other aspects of creation about which
evangelicals have
had disagreements (whether God used
process of evolution to bring about
much of creation, and
old the earth and the human race are)
We may define the doctrine of creation as follows: God created the entire
universe Out of nothing;
was riginally very good; and he created it to
glorify himself:
Uena mled
UMSerWuI
JoLhng
Biblical Evidence for Creation Out of
Nothing: The Bible clearly
requires US t0 believe that God created the universe out of nothing
Sometimes the Latin phrase ex nihilo_
out of nothing'
is used; it is then said
that the Bible teaches creation ex nihilo: -
This means that before God
began
how;
living
days
how
[0 create the universe
nothing else existed except God himself:
This is the implication of Genesis 1:1,
which says_
"In the
beginning God
created the heavens and the earth:
The phrase "the heavens and the earth'
includes the entire universe.
Psalm 33 also tells uS, "By the word of the LORD
the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of his mouth:
For
and it came [0
he commanded, and
stood forth'
(Ps. 33.6,9).
In the New Testament;
find
universal statement at the beginning of
John's gospel: "All things were made through him, and without him was not
anything made that was made'
(John 1.3). The phrase
is best
taken to refer t0 the entire universe (cf:
Acts 17.24; Heb_
11.3). Paul is quite
explicit in Colossians
when he specifies all the
of the universe_
both
visible and invisible things:
For in him all things were created, in heaven and
on earth_
visible and invisible; whether thrones or dominions or principalities
0r authorities
were created through him and for him" (Col. 1:16).
The song of the twenty-four elders in heaven likewise affirms this truth:
You are worthy; our Lord and God,
receive glory and honor and power;
for YOu created all things,
and by your will they existed and
#ere
created:
(Rev: 411)
In the last phrase God $ will is said to be the reason why
even "existed"
at all and why
were created_
'That God created both the heavens and the earth and everything in them is
affirmed several other times in the New Testament: For instance_
Acts 4.24
speaks of God as the "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth
and the sea and everything in them:
One of the first ways of identifying God
is [0 say that he is the one who created all
Bamabas and Paul explain
the pagan audience at Lystra that
are messengers of "a
living God who
made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them
(Acts
14.15). Similarly, when Paul is speaking to pagan Greek philosophers in
Athens
he identifies the true God as "The God who made the world and
everything in it" and says that this God "gives to all men life and breath and
everything'
(Acts 17.24-25; cf: Isa. 45.18; Rev: 10.6).
Hebrews 11.3 says, "By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by

reflects the Greek text.
Though the text does not
teach the doctrine of
creation Our of
it comes close t0 doing so
since
says that God did
not create the universe out of
anything that is visible.
The somewhat strange
idea that the universe might have been created out of something that was
invisible is probably not in the author
mind. He is
contradicting the idea of
creation out of previously existing matter; and for that purpose the verse is
clear:
Romans 4.17 also implies that God created out of
even if it does nor
exactly state it. The Greek text literally speaks of God as one who
calls
things not existing as existing-
The RSV translation,
calls into existence the
things that do not
(similarly NASB) is unusual but possible
grammatically;
and it makes an explicit affirmation of creation out of
nothing: Yet even if we translate it SO that the Greek word hos takes its
common sense
the verse says that God "calls the
which do nOr
exist as existing" (NASB mg ) But if God speaks to OF calls something that
does not exist; as if in fact it did exist; then what is implied? [f he calls things
that do not exist as though they existed_
must mean that they
soon exist;
irresistibly called into existence_
Because God created the entire universe Out of nothing there is no matter in
the universe that is eternal. All that we see
the mountains, the oceans, the
stars_
the earth itself
all came into existence when God created them: There
was
time when they did not exist:

God
in his wisdom, created it for
something: We should try t0 understand that purpose and use creation in ways
that fit that purpose, namely; tO
glory to God himself:
Moreover;
whenever the creation brings uS joy (cf:
Tim. 6.17), we should give thanks

2. The Creation of the Spiritual Universe: This creation of the entire
universe includes the creation of an unseen, spiritual
realm of existence: God
created the
angels and other kinds of heavenly beings as well as animals and
man_
He also created heaven as
place where his presence is especially
evident The creation of the spiritual realm
certainly implied in all the
verses above that speak of God creating not only the earth but also
and what is in it" (Rev: 10.6; cf:
Acts 4.24), but
is also explicitly affirmed in
number of other verses_
The prayer of Ezra says very clearly:
You are the
LORD, you alone; you have made heaven_
the heaven of heavens, with all their
the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you
preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships
(Neh: 9.6). The
"host of heaven
in this verse seems [0 refer tO the angels and other heavenly
creatures, since Ezra says that they engage in the activity of worshiping God
(the same term host is used to speak of
angels who worship God in Ps
103.21
and 148.2)
In the New Testament; Paul specifies that in Christ
were created, in
heaven and on earth, visible and invisible

all things
were
created through him and for him"
(Col:
1.16; cf. Ps. 148.2-5). Here the creation of invisible heavenly
also explicitly affirmed.
The Direct Creation of Adam and Eve. The Bible also teaches that God
created Adam and Eve in
special, persona)
way: "The LORD God formed
man of dust from the ground_
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
and man became
living being
(Gen 2.7). After that; God created Eve from
Adam $ body:
So the LORD God caused
deep sleep to fall upon the man,
and while he
took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and
the rib which the LORD God had taken from the man he made into
woman
and brought her to the man'
(Gen. 2.21-22). God apparently let Adam know
something of what had happened_
for Adam said,

and flesh of my flesh;

(Gen. 2.23)
As we shall see below; Christians differ On the extent t0 which evolutionary
developments may have occurred after creation
perhaps
(according
some)
leading to the development of more and more complex organisms. While
there are sincerely held differences on that question among some Christians
with respect to the plant and animal kingdoms; these texts are s0 explicit that
it would be
difficult for someone t0 hold t0 the complete truthfulness of
Scripture and still hold that human beings are the result of .
long evolutionary
process_
This
because when Scripture says that the Lord "formed man of
dust from the
ground"
Gen: 2.7), it does not seem possible tO understand that
to mean that he did it over
process that took millions of years and employed
the random development of thousands of increasingly complex organisms_
Even more
impossible
reconcile with an evolutionary view is the fact that
this narrative clearly portrays Eve as having no female parent: she was
created directly from Adam $ rib while Adam slept (Gen. 2.21). But on
purely evolutionary view; this would not be possible; for even the very first
female "human being'
would have been descended
some merely human
creature that was still an animal. The New Testament reaffirms the historicity
of this special creation of Eve from Adam when Paul says_
FOr man was nOt
made from woman; but woman from man: Neither was man created for
Womaa
but woman fOr man'
Cor: 18-9).
The specia)
creation of Adam and Eve shows that, though we may be like
animals in many respects in OUF physical
bodies, nonetheless we are very
different from animals_
We are created "in God's image,
the pinnacle of
God's creation, more like God than any other creature, appointed t0 rule over
the rest of creation.
Even the brevity of the Genesis account of creation places
wonderful emphasis on the importance of man in distinction from the rest of
the universe. It thus resists modern tendencies to see man as meaningless
the immensity of the universe.
Derek Kidner notes that Scripture
stands
against every tendency to empty human history of meaning
presenting the tremendous acts of creation as
mere curtain-raiser t0
the drama that slowly unfolds throughout the length of the Bible: The
prologue is over in

Scripture gives us the perspective on human
significance that God intends uS
to have: (This fact will be discussed in more detail in chapter 21, below:)
The Creation of Time_
One other aspect of God'$ creation is the creation
of time (the succession of moments one after another). This idea was
discussed with respect t0 God's attribute of eternity in chapter 11_
and we
need only summarize it here:
When we speak of God $ existence "before
the
creation of the world, we should nor think of God as
in an
unending
extension of time
Rather; God's eternity means that he has
different kind of
existence, an existence without the passage of time,
kind of existence that is
difficult for us even t0 imagine. (See Job 36.26; Ps. 90.2, 4; John 8.58;
Peter 3.8; Rev: 1.8). The fact that God created time reminds us of his lordship
over
and our obligation tO use
for his glory
The Work of the Son and of the Holy Spirit in Creation. God the Father
was the primary agent in initiating the act of creation_
But the Son and the
Holy Spirit were also active. The Son
often described as the one "through'
whom creation came about:
All things were made through him, and without
him was not anything made that was made" (John 1.3).
Paul says there is
one
Lord, Jesus Christ; through whom are all
and through whom we exist"
(1 Cor: 8.6) , and, "all
were created through him and for him" (Col.
1:16) . We read also that the Son is the one "through whom'
God
created the
world" (Heb: 1.2). These passages give
consistent picture of the Son as the
active agent carrying out the plans and directions of the Father:
The Holy Spirit was also at work in creation. He is generally pictured as
completing
and giving life to God*$ creation_
In Genesis 1.2, "the
Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters;" indicating
preserving; sustaining, governing function. Job says, "The spirit of God has
made me_
and the breath of the Almighty gives me life" (Job 33.4). In
number of Old Testament passages_
it is important t0 realize that the same
Hebrew word (riiach) can mean, in different contexts_
spirit;
or "breath;
wind
But in many cases there is not much difference in meaning-
tOr even
if one decided to translate some phrases as the "breath of God" or even the
wind of God;,
it would still seem
figurative way of referring to the
activity of the Holy Spirit in creation. So the psalmist,
speaking of the great

says

work; Job 26.13; Isa. 40.13;
Cor: 2.10). However; the testimony of Scripture
the specific activity of the Holy Spirit in creation is scarce
The work of the
Holy Spirit is brought into much greater prominence in connection with the
inspiring of the authors of Scripture and the applying of Christ'$ redemptive
work to the people of God:

the story of God $ involvement with
his creation; and particularly the people in it. Job affirms that even the
animals and plants depend on God: "In his hand is the life of every living
thing and the breath
all mankind" (Job 12.10). In the New Testament; Paul
affirms that God
'gives tO all men life and breath and everything" and that "in
him we live and move and have our being'
(Acts 17.25, 28). Indeed, in Christ
"all things hold together" (Col. 1:17), and he is continually "upholding the
universe by his word of power" (Heb: 1.3). God $ transcendence and
immanence are both affirmed in
single verse when Paul

The fact that creation is distinct from God yet always dependent on God, that
God is far above creation yet always involved in it (in brief; that God is both
transcendent and immanent), may be represented as in figure 15.1.

The scriptural account of God $ relation t0 his creation is also distinct from
pantheism. The Greek word pan means "all" 0r

idea that everything_

PANTHEISIA
Fiyure 15.3
Pantheism denies several essential aspects of God' s character: If the whole
universe is God_
then God has no distinct personality God is no longer
unchanging; because as the universe changes_
God also
changes. Moreover;
God is no longer holy; because the evil in the universe

Another difficulty is that ultimately most
pantheistic systems (such as
Buddhism and many other eastem religions) end up
the importance
of individual
human personalities: since everything
God, the
of an
individual should be to blend in with the universe and become more and more
united with it, thus losing his
her individual distinctiveness_
If God himself
(or itself) has no distinct personal identity separate from the universe_
then we
should certainly not strive to have one either: Thus, pantheism destroys not
only the persona
identity of God_
but also,
ultimately, of human beings as
well.
philosophy that sees creation as an "emanation'
out of God (that is_
something that comes out of God but is still part of God and not distinct from
him) would be similar tO pantheism in most or all of the ways in which

This point follows from the previous point: If God created the universe tO

because he understands that

The Relationthip Getween Scrinture an
Findinge
nlelndern -enae
At various times in
history; Christians have found themselves dissenting from
the accepted
of contemporary science: In the vast majority of cases_
sincere Christian faith and strong trust in the Bible have led scientists tO the
discovery of new facts about God's universe, and these discoveries have
changed scientific opinion for all of subsequent history. The lives of Isaac
Newton, Galileo Galilei; Johannes Kepler; Blaise Pascal, Robert Boyle,
Michael Faraday; James Clerk Maxwell, and many others are examples of
this_
On the other hand, there have been times when accepted scientific opinion has
been in conflict with people's understanding of what the Bible said. For
example
when the Italian astronomer Galileo (1564-1642)
began to teach
that the earth was not the center of the universe but that the earth and other
planets revolved around the sun (thus following the theories of the Polish
astronomer Copericus [1472-1543]), he was criticized
and eventually his
were condemned by the Roman Catholic Church: This was because
many people thought that the Bible taught that the sun revolved about the
earth_
In fact; the Bible does not teach that at all; but it was Copemican
astronomy that made people look again at Scripture to see if it really taught
whal
thought it taught: In fact; descriptions of the sun
and setting
(Eccl 1:5; et all) merely portray events as they appear from the perspective of
the human observer; and
that perspective_
they give an accurate
description
But
imply nothing about the relative motion of the earth and
the sun, and nowhere does the Bible explain what makes the sun go
down"
in the viewpoint of
human observer: Scripture says nothing at all about
whether the earth or the sun or some other body
the
center" of the universe
or the solar system
that is not
question Scripture addresses_
Yet the lesson
of Galileo_
who was forced t0 recant his teachings and who had tO live under
house arrest fOr the
ast few years of his life, should remind us that careful
observation of the natural world can cause US t0 go back t0 Scripture and
reexamine whether Scripture actually teaches what we think it teaches_
Sometimes

Scientific investigation has helped Christians reevaluate what earlier
generations thought about the age of the earth; for example, so that no
evangelical scholar today would hold that the world was created in 4004 B.C
Yet that date was once widely believed to be the date of the creation because
of the writings of Irish Archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656), one of the
great scholars of his day; who carefully added together the dates in the
genealogies of the Bible to find when Adam was created. Today it is widely
acknowledged that the Bible does not tell us the precise date of the creation of
the earth or of the human race (see below)
On the other hand, many people in the Christian community have steadfastly
refused to agree with the dominant opinion of scientists today regarding
evolution On this matter; thousands of Christians have examined Scripture
and again in great detail, and many have concluded that Scripture
not
silent on the process by which
organisms came into
being: Moreover;
careful observation of the facts of the created universe has produced
widespread disagreement regarding theories of evolution (both from scientists
who are Christians and from
number of non-Christian scientists as well)
So on both biblical
and scientific grounds, theories of evolution have been
challenged by Christians
We should also remember that the question of the creation of the universe is
unlike many other
scientific questions because creation is not something that
can be repeated in
laboratory experiment; nor were there any human
observers of it: Therefore pronouncements by scientists about creation and the
early history of the earth are at best educated speculation. If we are
convinced, however; that the only observer of these events (God himself) has
told us about them in the reliable words of the Bible, then we should pay
careful attention t0 the biblical account:
In the following section, we have listed some principles by which the
relationship between creation and the
of modern science can be
approached
When All the Facts Are Rightly Understood, There Will Be
No Final
Conflict" Between Scripture and Natural Science:
The phrase
no final
conflict" is taken from
very helpful book by Francis Schaeffer; No Final
Conflict
Regarding questions about the creation of the universe, Schaeffer
lists several areas where, in his
judgment; there is room for disagreement
among Christians who believe in the total truthfulness of Scripture:
There is
possibility that God created

There is
possibility of

1.2 and 1.3.
There is

There is
possibility that the flood affected the geological data
The use of the word "kinds
in Genesis
may be quite broad_
There is
possibility of the death of animals before the fall_
Where the Hebrew word bara'is not used there is the possibility of
sequence from previously existing things
Schaeffer makes clear that he is nOt saying that any of those positions is his
own; only that
are theoretically possible_
Schaeffer'$ major point is that
in both our understanding of the natural world and
understanding of
Scripture_
our knowledge is nOt perfect. But we can approach both scientific
and biblical study with the confidence that when all the facts are correctly
understood, and when we have understood Scripture rightly; our findings will
neven
be in conflict with each other: there will be
'no final conflict
This is
because God, who speaks in Scripture; knows all facts_
and he has not spoken
way that would contradict any true fact in the universe_
This is
helpful perspective with which the Christian should begin any
study of creation and modem science_
We should not fear t0 investigate
scientifically the facts of the created world but should do s0
eagerly and with
complete honesty, confident that when facts are rightly understood, they will
always tuM out [0 be consistent with God $ inerrant words
Scripture.
Similarly; we should approach the study of Scripture eagerly and with
confidence that; when rightly understood, Scripture will never contradict facts
in the naturab
world:
Someone may object that this whole discussion is inappropriate

However; as we noted

2. Some Theories About Creation Seem Clearly Inconsistent With the
Teachings of Scripture:
In this section we will examine three types of
explanation of the origin of the universe that seem clearly inconsistent with
Scripture _
Secular Theories: For the sake of completeness we mention here only
briefly that any purely secular theories of the origin of the universe would be
unacceptable for those who believe in Scripture:
'secular" theory is any
theory of the origin of the universe that does not see an infinite-personal God
responsible for creating the universe by intelligent design_
Thus, the "big
bang
theory (in
secular form
which God is excluded), or any theories
that hold that malter has always existed, would be inconsistent with the
of Scripture that God created the universe out of
and that he
did so for his own glory: (When Darwinian evolution is thought of in
totally
materialistic sense, as it most often is_
would belong
this category also.)
Theistic Evolution: Ever since the publication of Charles Darwin's book
Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), some Christians have
proposed that
organisms came about by the process of evolution that
Darwin proposed, but that God
that process s0 that the result was just
what he wanted it to be. This view is called theistic evolution because it
advocates belief in God (it is "theistic'
and in evolution t0o. Many who hold
theistic evolution would propose that God intervened in the process at
some crucial points, usually (1) the creation of matter at the beginning;
the
creation of the simplest life form; and (3) the creation
man_
But, with the
possible exception of those points of intervention; theistic evolutionists hold
that evolution proceeded in the ways nOW discovered by natural scientists,
and that it was the process that God decided t0 use in allowing all of the other
forms of life on earth to develop. They believe that the random mutation of
led to the evolution of higher life forms through the fact that
those that had an
adaptive advantage'
mutation that allowed them t0 be
better fitted t0 survive in their environment) lived when others did nOt
Theistic evolutionists are quite prepared to change their views of the way
evolution came about; because_
according
[0 their standpoint; the Bible does
not specify how
happened. It is therefore up to uS
discover this through
ordinary scientific investigation. They would argue that as we learn more and
more about the way in which evolution came about; we are simply
learning
more and more about the process that God used to bring about the
development of life forms.
teaching
nothing;

guided
living
things
The objections to theistic evolution are as follows:
The clear teaching of Scripture that there is purposefulness
God $ work
of creation seems incompatible with the randomness demanded by
evolutionary theory When Scripture reports that God said, "Let the earth
bring forth
creatures
according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things
and beasts of the earth
according to their kinds" (Gen. 1:24), it pictures God
things intentionally and with
purpose for each
he does_
But
this is the opposite of allowing mutations t0 proceed entirely randomly; with
no purpose for the millions of mutations that would have [0 come about,
under evolutionary theory; before
new species could emerge_
The fundamental difference between
biblical view of creation and theistic
evolution lies here:
the driving force that brings about change and the
development of new species in all evolutionary schemes is randomness
Without the random mutation of organisms YOu do not have evolution in the
modern scientific sense at all. Random mutation is the underlying force that
brings about eventual development from the simplest to the most complex life
forms.
But the
driving force in the development of new organisms according
Scripture
God's intelligent design.
God created "the
creatures of the
sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according
t0 their kinds,
and every winged bird
according
t0 its kind" (Gen: 1.21 NIV)
"God made the wild animals
according
to their kinds_
the livestock
according
to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to
their kinds.
And God saw that it was
(Gen: 1.25 NIV) These
statements seem inconsistent with the idea of God creating Or directing or
observing millions of random mutations
none 0f which were
good" in
the way he intended, none of which really were the kinds of plants or animals
he wanted to have on the earth: Instead of the straightforward biblical account
of God $ creation, the theistic evolution view has t0 understand events t0 have
occurred something like this:
And God said, "Let the earth
forth
creamures
according -
their kinds_
And after three hundred eighty-seven million four
hundred ninety-two thousand eight hundred seventy-one attempts
God finally made
mouse that worked:
That may seem
strange explanation; but it is precisely what the theistic
evolutionist must
postulate for each of the hundreds of thousands of different
kinds of plants and animals on the earth: they all developed through
process
of random mutation over millions of years,
gradually increasing in complexity
as occasional
mutations turned out to be advantageous tO the creature_

theistic evolutionist may object that God intervened in the process and
guided it at many points in the direction he wanted it t0 go_
But once this is
allowed then there is purpose and intelligent design in the process
we n10
longer have evolution at all, because there is no longer random mutation (at
the points of divine interaction):
No secular evolutionist would accept such
intervention by an intelligent, purposeful Creator But once
Christian agrees
[0 some active;
purposeful design by God, then there
longer any need for
randomness 0r any
development emerging from random mutation. Thus we
may as well have God immediately creating each distinct creature without
thousands of attempts that fail.
2. Scripture pictures God'$ creative word as bringing immediate response_
When the Bible talks about God' $ creative word it emphasizes the pOwer of
his word and its ability t0 accomplish his purpose:
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,
and all their host by the breath of his mouth
For he
and
came to be;
he commanded, and
stood forth: (Ps. 33.6,9)
This kind of statement seems
incompatible with the idea that God spoke and
after millions of years and millions of random mutations in living things his
power brought about the result that he had called for: Rather; as soon as God
says
"Let the earth put forth
vegetation,
the very next sentence tells uS
And
was SO
(Gen
:H1).
When Scripture tells us that God made plants and animals to reproduce
according t0 their kinds
(Gen.
1:11, 24),
suggests that God created many
different types of plants and animals and that; though there would be some
differentiation among them (note many different sizes_
races_
and personal
characteristics among human beings!), nonetheless there would be some
narrow limits to the kind of change that could come about through genetic
mutations_
God*s present active role in creating or forming every
thing that now
comes into being is hard t0 reconcile with the distant "hands off
kind of
oversight of evolution that
proposed by theistic evolution. David is able t0
confess,
You formed my inward parts, you knit me together in my mother'$
womb" (Ps. 139.13) And God said t0 Moses, "Who has made man'
mouth?
spoke;
living_
Who makes him dumb_
or deaf, or seeing,
blind? [s
the LORD?"
(Ex. 4:11). God makes the grass grow (Ps. 104:14; Matt: 6.30) and feeds the
birds (Matt: 6.26) and the other creatures of the forest (Ps. 104.21,27-30). If
God is so involved in causing the growth and development of every step of
every
thing even nOw, does
seem consistent with Scripture t0 say that
these life forms were originally brought about by an evolutionary process
directed by random mutation rather than by God'$ direct; purposeful creation,
and that only after they had been created did he begin his active involvement
in directing them each moment?
5. The special creation of Adam; and Eve from him;
strong reason [0
break with theistic evolution. Those theistic evolutionists who argue for
special creation of Adam and Eve because of the statements in Genesis 1-2
have really broken with evolutionary theory at the point that is of most
concern [0 human
anyway: But if, on the basis of Scripture; we insist
upon God $ special
intervention at the point of the creation of Adam and Eve,
then whar is
prevent our
allowing that God intervened, in
similar way; in
the creation of living organisms?
We must realize that the specia
creation of Adam and Eve as recorded in
Scripture shows them to be far different from the nearly animal, just barely
human creatures that evolutionists would say were the first humans, creatures
who descended from ancestors that were highly developed nonhuman apelike
creatures. Scripture pictures the first man and woman; Adam and Eve_
possessing highly developed linguistic, moral, and spiritual abilities from the
moment
were created. They can talk with each other:
can even talk
with God. They are very different from the nearly animal first humans
descended trom nonhuman apelike creatures_
of evolutionary theory.
Some may object that Genesis 1-2 does not intend to portray Adam and Eve
as literal individuals_
but (a) the historical
narrative in Genesis continues
without
break into the obviously historical material about Abraham (Gen.
12),
that the author intended the entire section to be historical;
and
(b) in Romans 5.12-21 and
Corinthians 15.21-22,45-49_
Paul affirms the
existence of the
one
Adam through whom sin came into the world, and
bases his discussion of Christ'$ representative work of earning salvation on
the previous historical pattern of Adam being
representative for mankind as
well: Moreover; the New Testament elsewhere clearly understands Adam and
Eve to be historical figures (cf: Luke 3.38; Acts 17.26;
Cor: 11.8-9;
Cor:
1133;
Tim. 2.13-14). The New Testament also assumes the historicity of the
sons of Adam and Eve; Cain (Heb_
11:4;
John 3.12; Jude 11) and Abel
(Matt: 23.35; Luke 1.51; Heb_
11.4; 12.24).

There are many scientific problems with evolutionary theory (see the
following section). The increasing number of questions about the validity of
the theory of evolution being raised even by non-Christians in various
scientific disciplines indicates that anyone who claims to be forced to believe
in evolution because the "scientific facts
leave no other option has simply
not considered all the evidence on the other side. The scientific data do not
force one t0 accept evolution_
and if the scriptura
record argues
convincingly
ir aS well, it does not seem [0 be
valid theory for
Christian t0
adop:
It seems most appropriate tO conclude in the words of geologist Davis
Young; "The position of theistic evolutionism as expressed by some of its
proponents is nOt
consistently Christian position:
is not
truly biblical
position; for it is based
part on principles that are imported into
Christianity.-
According t0 Louis Berkhof "theistic evolution
really
child of embarrassment; which calls God in at periodic intervals to help nature
over the chasms that yawn at her feet: It is neither the biblical doctrine of
creation, nor
consistent theory of evolution.
Notes 0n the Darwinian Theory of Evolution: The word evolution can be
used in different ways
Sometimes it is used t0 refer [0

of such

But that is not the sense in which the word evolution
usually used
when discussing theories of creation and evolution.
The term evolution is more commonly used t0 refer t0 "macro-evolution"
that iS
the "general theory of evolution'
or the view that

More and more mutations eventually developed into more and more varieties
of living things_
that from the very simplest organism all the complex life
forms on earth eventually developed through this process of mutation and
natural selection:
The most recent; and perhaps most devastating; critique of current Darwinian
theory comes from Philip
Johnson,
law professor who specializes in
analyzing the logic of arguments_
In his book Darwin on Trial,
he quotes
extensively from current evolutionary theorists t0 demonstrate that:
After more than one hundred years of experimental breeding of various
kinds of animals and plants, the amount of variation that can be produced
(even with intentional, not random,

He
concludes that "natural selection;

survival of new organisms

know which characteristics have given an advantage in survival to certain
animals? By observing which kinds survive.

An amusing example of the need for all the

pointed out by Robert Kofahl and Kelly Segraves
in their book, The Creation Explanation:

An explosion takes place and the chemical repellent is fired at a
temperature of 212PF at the beetle

Segraves rightly ask
whether any evolutionary explanation can account for this amazing
mechanism:

The fossil record was Darwin'$ greatest problem in 1859
and it has
simply
become
greater problem since then. In Darwin $
hundreds of fossils
were available showing the existence of many distinct kinds of animals and
plants
the distant past_ But Darwin was unable t0 find any fossils from
"intermediate types" t0 fill in the gaps between distinct kinds of animals
fossils showing some characteristics of one animal and
few characteristics
of the next developmental type_
for example_
In fact; many ancient fossils
exactly resembled present-day animals
~showing that (according to the
chronological assumptions of his view) numerous animals have persisted for
millions of years essentially unchanged_
Darwin realized that the absence of
transitional types'
the fossil record weakened his theory; but he thought it
was due t0 the fact that not enough fossils had been discovered;
and was
confident that further discoveries
unearth many transitional types of
animals_
However; the subsequent 130 years of intensive archaeological
activity has still failed t0 produce one
convincing example of
needed
transitional type.
Johnson quotes noted evolutionist Stephen
Gould of Harvard as saying
that there are tWo characteristics of the fossil record that are inconsistent with
the idea of gradual change through generations:
Stasis_
Most species exhibit no directional change

when they disappear; morphological change is usually limited and

investigation ) The significance of this problem is demonstrated forcefully in
recent book by
HOM-
Christian writer; Michael Denton; Evolution:
Theory
in Crisis_
Denton himself proposes no alternative explanation for the
emergence of life in its present form upon the earth; but he notes that since
Darwin'
time
neither of the two fundamental axioms of Darwin $
macroevolutionary theory
the concept of the continuity of nature
that is the idea of _
functional continuum of all life forms linking all
species together and ultimately leading back t0
primeval cell, and
the belief that all the adaptive design of life has resulted from
blind
random process
have been validated by one single empirical
discovery or scientific advance since 1859.
5. The molecular structures of living organisms do show relationships, but
Darwinists simply assume that relationships imply common ancestry;
claim
that certainly has not been proven. Moreover; there are
amazing molecular
differences between living things, and no satisfactory explanation for the
origin of those differences has been given.
Of course, similarity of design at any level (including levels above the
molecular level) has often been used as
argument for evolution. The
assumption of evolutionists is that similarity of design between Iwo species
implies that the "lower" species evolved into the "higher" species, but the
for that assumption has never been given. Gleason Archer illustrates
this well by supposing that one visits
museum of science and industry and
finds
display of how human beings evolved from earlier apelike creatures
progressively more human-looking beings and finally into modern man_
But he rightly notes that
continuity of basic design furnishes no evidence whatever that any
"lower" species phased into the next "higher" species by any sort of
internal dynamic_
as evolution demands- For if the museum visitor
were
go to another part of that museum of science and industry, he
would find
completely analogous series of automobiles,
commencing with 1900 and extending up until the present decade.
Stage by stage

he could trace the development of the
proof

Ford from its earliest Model-[ prototype

Of course
much better explanation for the similarities in various models of
Ford automobiles is the fact that an
intelligent designer (0r group of
designers_
used similar structures
successively more complex automobiles
~if
steering mechanism works well in one model, there is no need t0 invent
different kind of steering mechanism for another model. In the same way;
similarities in
among all living things can equally well be taken a5
evidence of the work of an intelligent master craftsman; the Creator himself:
6. Probably the greatest difficulty of all for evolutionary
is explaining
how any life could have begun in the first place. The spontaneous generation
of even the simplest living
organism capable of independent life (the
prokaryote bacterial cell) from inorganic materials on the earth could not
happen by random
of chemicals: it requires
intelligent design and
craftsmanship S0 complex that no advanced scientific laboratory in the world
has been able to do it: Johnson quotes

that life simply does not come about by chance but must be intentionally

intelligent designer: In theory at

(2) The Destructive Influences of Evolutionary Theory in Modern
Thought: It is important t0 understand the incredibly destructive influences
that evolutionary theory has had on modern thinking: If in fact life was not
created by God, and if human beings
particular are not created by God or
responsible to him; but are simply the result of random occurrences in the
universe_
then of what significance is human life? We are merely the product
of matter plus time plus chance_
and s0 t0 think that we have any eternal
importance_
really any importance at all in the face of an immense
universe
simply
delude ourselves. Honest reflection on this notion
should lead people t0
profound sense of despair:
Moreover; if all of life can be explained by evolutionary theory apart from
God
and if there is no God who created uS (0r at least if we cannot know
anything about him with certainty), then there is no supreme Judge to hold uS
morally accountable. Therefore there are no moral absolutes in human life,
and people
moral ideas are only subjective preferences, good for them
perhaps but not t0 be imposed on others. In
in such
case the only
forbidden is to say that one knows that certain things are right and certain
things are wrong_
There
another ominous consequence of evolutionary theory: If the
inevitable processes of natural selection continue
bring about improvement
in life forms 0n earth through the survival of the fittest; then why should we
hinder this process by caring for those who are weak or less able to defend
themselves? Should we nOt rather allow them to die without reproducing sO

d. The Theory of a "Gap" Between Genesis I:l and 1:2: Some
evangelicals have proposed that there is
gap of millions of years between
Genesis 1:1 ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
and
Genesis 1.2
The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon

form and void" (an alternative_
but doubtful, translation proposed for Gen:
1.2).
What we read of in Genesis 1.3-2.3
really the second creation of
God

which occurred only recently
(perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 years ag0). The ancient fossils found on the earth;
many of which are said to be millions of years old_
stem from the first
creation (4,500,000,000 years ag0), which is mentioned only in Genesis 1:1.
The primary biblical argument for this theory is that the words

1:2 pictures the earth as desolate after God'$ judgment If God first forms the

In addition t0 the fact that Genesis 1.2 does not give support t0 this view;
there are some other arguments that weigh strongly against the gap theory:
There
no verse in Scripture that explicitly talks about an earlier creation:
So this theory is
even one verse of Scripture tO give it explicit
support
2. In Genesis 1.31_
when God finished his work of creation_
we read
And
God saw everything that he had made, and behold
was very good
But
according to the gap theory; God would be looking at an earth full of the
results of rebellion, conflict; and terrible divine
judgment: He would also be
looking at all the demonic beings, the hosts of Satan who had rebelled against
him, and yet be calling everything
good:
It is difficult to believe that
there was S0 much evil and s0 many evidences of rebellion and judgment on
the earth, and that God could still say that creation was very good.
Moreover; Genesis 2:1 says, in an apparent summary of all that has happened
in Genesis
"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
of them:
Here it is not just God $ work on the earth; but all that he made in
the heavens, that is said t0 have been completed in the narrative in Genesis
This would not allow for large
of heaven and earth to have been finished
before the six creation days.
3. In
later description of God' s work of creation found in the Ten
Commandments
read, "for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that is in them; and rested the seventh
therefore the LORD
blessed the sabbath

Whether we take these [0

itself) and in the heavens (such as the stars) that God did not make in the six

This theory must assume that all of the fossils of animals from millions of
years ag0 that resemble very closely animals from today indicate that God s
first creation of the animal and plant kingdom resulted in
failure. These
animals and plants did not fulfill God'$ original purpose; so he destroyed
them
but in the second creation he made others that were exactly like them:
Moreover; since Adam and Eve were the first man and woman, this theory
must assume that there was
creation of God that existed for millions of
years but lacked the highest aspect of God $ creative work, namely; man
himself: But both the failure of God to accomplish his purposes with the
original plant and animal kingdoms_
and the failure of God to crown creation
with his highest creature; man, seem inconsistent with the biblical picture of
God as one who always accomplishes his purposes in whatever he does. So
the gap theory does not seem

3. The Age of the Earth: Some Preliminary Considerations. Up tO this
point, the discussions in this chapter have advocated conclusions that we
will find broad assent among

Christians
But now at last we come
perplexing question about which Bible-believing Christians have differed
for many years_
sometimes very sharply: The question
simply this: How old
is the earth?
It is appropriate to treat this question after all the earlier matters, because it is
really much less important than the doctrines considered above_
These earlier
matters may be summarized as follows: (1) God created the universe out of
creation is distinct from God, yet always dependent on God;
God created the universe tO show his glory; (4) the universe God created was
very good; (5)
there will be no final conflict between Scripture and science;
secular theories that
God as Creator; including Darwinian evolution
are clearly incompatible with belief in the Bible:

the consensus of modern science that the earth is

are incorrect The difference between these two views is enormous:
4,499,980,000 years_
Before

we will examine
some
preliminary questions about the genealogies

curent
estimates for the age of the human race,
differing views 0n the date of
dinosaurs, and the length of the six creation
in Genesis
There Are Gaps in the Genealogies of the Bible: When one reads the list
of names in Scripture together with their ages, it might seem as though
could add
together the ages of all the people in the history of redemption from
Adam to Christ and come up with an
approximate date for the creation of the
earth. Certainly this would give
very recent date for creation (such as
Archbishop Ussher'
date of 4004 B.C.) But closer inspection of the parallel
lists of names in Scripture will show that Scripture itself indicates the fact that
the genealogies list only those names the biblical writers thought
important
record for their purposes_
In facL; some genealogies include names that are
left out by other
genealogies in Scripture itself
For instance_
Matthew 1.8-9 tells us that Asa was "the father of Jehoshaphat;
and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, and
Uzziah the father of Jotham; and Jotham the father of Ahaz:
But from
Chronicles 3.10-12 (which uses the alternate name Ahaziah for Uzziah), we
lear that three generations have been omitted by Matthew: Joash, Amaziah;,
and Azariah: So these texts can be
compared in the
following table:

Therefore
when Matthew says that Uzziah was "the father of Jotham;
it can
mean that he was the father of someone who led t0 Jotham: Matthew has
selected those names that he wants to emphasize for his Own purposes.
similar phenomenon is evident in Matthew 1.20 where the angel of the Lord
speaks to Joseph and calls him; "Joseph; son of David_
Now Joseph is not
directly the son of David (for David lived around 1000 B.C.) but Joseph is
the descendant of David and
therefore called his
son.
Another example is found in
Chronicles 26.24 in
list of officers appointed
David near the end of his life
We read that "Shebuel the son of
Gershom
son of Moses_
was chief officer in charge of the treasuries"

we know from Exodus 2.22 that Gershom was the son
born t0 Moses before the Exodus_
sometime around 1480 BC
(or;, on
late
date for the exodus; around 1330 B.C.) But these officials mentioned in
Chronicles 26 were appointed at the time that David made Solomon
over
Israel, around 970 BC_
(see
Chron:
23.1). That means that in
Chronicles
26.24 Shebuel is said t0 be "the son of Gershom;

seems only fair tO conclude that the genealogies of Scripture have some
gaps in them, and that God only caused to be recorded those names that were
important for his purposes. How many gaps there are and how many
generations

Did Animals Die Before the Fall? For young earth advocates
there is no
need t0 ask whether animals died before the fall; because animals and man
were both created on the sixth day, and there may have been only
short
before Adam and Eve sinned_
could have introduced death into the
animal kingdom as well, as part of the curse of the fall (Gen: 3.17-19; Rom:
8.20-23).
But for old earth advocates, this is an important question There are millions
of apparently ancient fossils in the earth: Might
have come from animals
who lived and died for long ages before Adam and Eve were created? Might
God have created an anima
kingdom that was subject to death
the
moment of creation? This is quite possible_
There was nO doubt death in the
plant world, if Adam and Eve were t0 eat plants; and if God had made an
original creation in which animals would reproduce and also live forever; the
earth would soon be overcrowded with no
of relief: The warning
Adam in Genesis 2:17 was only that he would die if he ate of the forbidden
fruit, not that animals would also begin to die.
When Paul says, "Sin came
into the world through one man and death through sin" (Rom. 5.12a), the
following phrase makes clear that he is
about death for human
not for plants and animals, for he immediately adds_
and s0 death spread to
all men because all men sinned" (Rom. 5.12b).
From the information we have in Scripture_
we cannot nw know whether
God created animals subject t0 aging and death from the

What About Dinosaurs?: Current scientific opinion holds that dinosaurs

creatures created by God on the same day he created man (the sixth

Among those who hold to an old earth view; some would want t0 say that
dinosaurs were among the creatures that Adam named in Genesis 2:19-20_
and that they subsequently perished (perhaps in the flood) They would admit
that dinosaurs may have existed earlier; but would say that
did not
become extinct until after the time of Adam and Eve_
Others would say that
the sixth day of creation was millions of years long_
and that dinosaurs had
already become extinct by the time Adam was created and named the animals.
In this case_
Adam did not name dinosaurs (the Bible does not say that he
did), but he only named all the creatures that were living at the time God
brought him all the animals to name (Gen. 2:19-20; see
Of course, this
view would require that there was death in the animal world before there was
sin (see
previous section).
Are the Six Days of Creation Twenty-four-Hour Days?: Much of the
dispute between "young earth'
and "old earth" advocates
on the
interpretation of the length of "days'
in Genesis
Old earth supporters
propose that the six "days
ot Genesis
refer not tO periods of twenty-four
hours
but rather [0
periods of time, millions of years, during which God
canied out the creative activities described in Genesis
This proposal has led
heated debate
other
evangelicals, which is far from being settled
decisively one way 0r another:
In favor of
the six
periods of time is the fact that the
Hebrew word yom;
day;'
is sometimes used t0 refer not t0
twenty-four-
hour literal day; but t0
longer period of time.
We see this when the word is
used in Genesis 2.4

six days of creation. Other

deep
sleep to fall upon Adam and creating Eve from his rib (Gen. 2.21-25). The

God would by itself seem

would be an
'ordinary" understanding of the passage for an original reader;
consideration that is not unimportant in
debate that often emphasizes what
an ordinary reading of the text by the original readers would lead them to
conclude
If the sixth day is shown by contextual considerations t0 be
considerably longer than an ordinary twenty-four-hour day; then does not the
context itself favor the sense of day as simply
'period of time

Related to this is one more consideration. The seventh day; it should be noted,

The text just says that God

not clearly specify for uS one meaning of day or another; and if
convincing
scientific data about the age of the earth; drawn from many different
disciplines and giving similar answers,
convinces US that the earth is billions
of years old, then this possible interpretation of day as
long period of time
may be the best interpretation to
In this way; the situation is
something
like that faced by those who first held that the earth rotates on its axis and
revolves abour the sun_
would not say that the passages about the sun
'rising'
going down'
require US
in their contexts_
believe in a
heliocentric (sun-centered) solar system; but that this is
possible
understanding of the texts, seeing them as only speaking
the standpoint
of the observer: Observational evidence taken
science informs uS thar
this is in fact the correct way to interpret those texts_
On the other side of this question are the arguments in favor of understanding
"day
twenty-four-hour day in Genesis 1:
1. It is significant that each of the
of Genesis
ends with an expression
such as
And there was evening; and there was morning
the first day'
(Gen_
1:5 NIV) The phrase
And there was
and there was morning
repeated in verses 8, 13, 19_
23, and 31
This seems tO imply the sequence
of events marking
literal twenty-four-hour day and suggests that the readers
should understand it in that way:
longer
long
quite
would

This is
strong argument from context, and many have found it persuasive.
Yet those who hold to
long period of time for these
days'
could respond (a)
that even evening and morning do not constitute an entire day; but only the
end of one
and the
beginning of another; so the expression itself may be
simply
of the author'$ way of
telling us that the end of the first creative
day (that is, long period of time) occurred_
and the beginning of the next
creative
day" had come;
and also (b) that the first three creative
days"
could not have been marked by evening and moring as caused by the sun
shining on the earth; for the sun was not created until the fourth day (Gen_
1:14-19); thus, the very context shows that "evening and morning" in this
chapter does not refer to the ordinary evening and
morning of ==
as we
know them now: So the argument from
evening and morning-
though it may
give some weight tO the twenty-four-hour view; does not seem tO tip the
balance decisively in its favor:
2. The third day of creation cannot be
long-
because the sun does not
come inLO
until the fourth
and plants cannot live
without light:
In response t0 this_
it might be said that the light that God created on the first
day energized the plants fOr millions of years.
But that would suppose God to
have created
light that is almost exactly like sunlight in brightness and
power; but still not sunlight
an unusual
suggestion.
3. It is hard
avoid the conclusion that
the Ten Commandments the word
day is used
mean
twenty-four-hour day:
Remember the sabbath
it holy. Six
you shall labor;
and do all your work; but the seventh day is
sabbath t0 the LORD
your God;
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the
and all that is in them
and rested the seventh day; therefore the
LoRD blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
(Ex: 20.8-11)
Certainly in that text the sabbath
day" is
twenty-four-hour
And must
we not say that verse 1l,
which in the same sentence says that the Lord made
heaven and earth in
six days;
uses
day" in the same sense? This is again
weighty argument; and on balance
gives additional persuasiveness t0 the
twenty-four-hour
position. But once again it is not quite conclusive in
itself; for one could respond that the readers were aware (from
careful
reading
Gen
2) that the
there were unspecified periods of time, and
that the sabbath commandment merely told God s people
just as he
followed
six-plus-one pattern in creation (six periods of work followed by
period of rest), so they were t0 follow
six-plus-one pattem in their lives (six
days of work followed by
day 0f rest; also six years
work followed by
day
part
days

days
that;
sabbath year of rest;
as in Ex: 23.10-11). In
in the very next sentence of
the Ten Commandments
day" means
period of time'
"Honor
father
and your mother; that YOur days may be
in the land which the LORD your
God gives you"
(Ex. 20.12). Certainly here the promise
nol tOr
literal days (such as twenty-five
twenty-six-hour days ), but rather that the
period of one'$ life may be lengthened upon the earth:
Those who argue for
day" as
twenty-four-hour day also ask whether
anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible the word
days
in the plural, especially
when
number is attached (such as "six
ever
refers t0
anything but
twenty-four-hour days_
This argument is not
compelling: however; because (a)
plural example of
days'
mean periods of time is found in Exodus 20:12,
discussed in the
previous paragraph and (b) if the word clearly takes the sense
period of time
in the
singular (which it
as all admit), then t0 speak of
six such "periods'
of time would certainly be understandable t0 the readers_
even if the Old Testament did not elsewhere have examples of such
meaning:
The fact that such an expression does not appear elsewhere may
mean
nothing more than that there was no occasion t0 use
elsewhere
When Jesus says, "But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them
male and female'
(Mark 10.6), he implies that Adam and Eve were not
created billions of vears after the
beginning of creation, but at the beginning
of creation. This argument also has some force; but old
advocates may
respond that Jesus
just referring
the whole of Genesis 1-2 as the
"beginning of creation;
contrast
the argument from the laws given by
Moses that the Pharisees were depending on (v. 4).
[have given an answer
each of the five arguments for
twenty-four-hour
but these answers may not persuade its advocates. They would respond
the
period of time" position as follows: (1) Of course, it is true that day
may mean
period of time'
many places in the Old Testament; but that
does not demonstrate that
must have that meaning in Genesis
(2) The
sixth
of creation need not have been
longer than twenty-four hours_
especially if Adam only named major representative kinds of birds and of
every beast of the field" (Gen. 2.20). (3) Though there
was n0 sun t0 mark
the first three
of creation, nonetheless
the earth was still
on its
axis at
fixed speed
and there was "lighr" and "darkness" that God created
on the first day (Gen: 1.3
and he called the light "day" and the darkness
"night" (Gen: 3.5). So God in some way caused an alternation between
and night from the very first day of creation

seem at all easy t0 decide with the information we nOw have. It is not simply
question of "believing the Bible" or
not believing the Bible,
nor is it a
question of "giving in to modern science
rejecting the clear conclusions
of modern science.
Even for those who believe in the complete truthfulness
of Scripture (such as the present author), and who retain some doubt about the
exceptionally long periods of time scientists propose for the age of the earth
(such as the present author), the question does not seem t0 be easy t0 decide:
At present, considerations of the power of God $ creative word and the
immediacy with which
seems t0 bring response_
the fact that
evening and
morning
and the numbering of days
suggest twenty-four-hour days
and
the fact that God would seem to have no purpose for
delaying the creation of
man for thousands or even millions of years
seem tO me t0 be strong
considerations
favor of the twenty-four-hour day position:
But even here
there are
good arguments on the other side: To the one who lives forever; for
whom

thousand years as one day"
Peter 3.8) , who delights in gradually working out all his purposes over time,
perhaps 15 billion years is just the right amount of time t0 take in preparing
the universe for man'$ arrival and 4.5 billion years in preparing the earth: The
evidence of incredible antiquity in the universe would then serve as
vivid
reminder of the even more amazing nature of God's eternity; just as the
incredible size of the universe causes US tO wonder at God'$ even greater
omnipresence and omnipotence
Therefore_
with respect to the length of days in Genesis
the
possibility must
be left open that God has chosen not to give US enough information to come [O
clear decision on this question, and the real test of faithfulness to him may
be the degree t0 which we can act charitably toward those who in good
conscience and full belief in God s Word hold t0
different position on this
matter:
Both "Old Earth" and " Young Earth" Theories Are Valid Options for
Christians Who Believe the Bible Today: After discussing several
preliminary considerations regarding the age of the earth, we come finally t0
the specific arguments for old earth and young earth views
#Old Earth" Theories of Creation: In this first category we list two
viewpoints held by those who believe in an old earth with an age of about 4.5
billion years and
universe about 15 billion years old_
Day-Age View: Many who believe that the earth is many millions of
years old maintain that the days of Genesis
extremely
ages"
time.
The arguments given above for long days in Genesis
will apply here,
still
day
long
and_
as we
argued above; the words of the Hebrew text do allow for the
be long periods of time: The evident advantage of this view is that, if the
current scientific estimate for an earth 4.5 billion years old is correct;
explains how the Bible is consistent with this fact Among
evangelicals who
hold to an old earth view, this is
common position This view
sometimes
called
concordist" view because
seeks agreement
concord" between
the Bible and scientific conclusions about dating:
Many have been attracted t0 this position because of scientific evidence
regarding the age of the earth:
very helpful suivey of the views of
theologians and scientists regarding the age of the earth; from ancient Greece
to the twentieth century; is found in
book by
professional geologist who is
also an
evangelical Christian; Davis
Young; Christianity and the Age of the
Earth:
Young demonstrates that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
many Christian geologists_
under the weight of apparently overwhelming
evidence, have concluded that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old_
Although some
'young earth" proponents (see discussion below) have
claimed that radiometric
techniques are inaccurate because of changes
that occurred on the earth at the time of the flood, Young notes that
radiometric dating of rocks from the moon and of meteorites recently fallen to
the earth; which could not have been affected by Noah's flood, coincide with
many other radiometric evidences from various materials on the earth; and
that the results of these tests are
remarkably consistent in pointing to about
4.5-4.7 billion years_
Some of Young's most forceful arguments for an old earth; in addition
those from radiometric
include the time required for liquid magma tO
cool (about
million years for
large formation in southern California) , the
time and pressure required for the formation of many metamorphic rocks that
contain small fossils (some apparently could only be formed by the pressure
of being buried twelve to eighteen miles under ground and later brought to the
surface
but when could this have happened on
young earth view?),
continental drift (fossil-bearing rock fields near the coasts of Africa and South
America were apparently previously joined
together; then separated by
continental drift;
something that could not have happened in 20,000 years at
the present rate of [WO centimeters per year),
and coral reefs (some of which
apparently would have required hundreds of thousands of years of gradual
deposits t0 attain their present state_
Severab
other arguments , especially
from astronomy, have been summarized by Robert C
Newman and Herman
Eckelmann;
in Genesis One and the Origin of the Earth:
These
days
dating
dating
arguments favor an old earth view, and the day-age theory is an attractive
position for old earth advocates:
The day-age view is certainly possible
but it has several difficulties: (1) The
sequence of events in Genesis
does not exactly correspond to current
scientific understanding of the development of life, which puts sea creatures
(Day 5) before trees (Day 3), and insects and other land animals (Day 6), as
well as fish (Day 5), before birds (Day 5).
(2) The greatest difficulty for this
view is that it putS the sun, moon_
and stars (Day
millions of years after the
creation of plants and trees
3). That makes no sense at all
according =
current scientific opinion
which sees the stars as
formed
before the earth
0r' any
living creatures 0n the earth It also makes no sense in terms of the way
the earth now operates, for plants do not grow without sunlight, and there are
many plants (Day 3) that do nOt pollinate without birds 0r -
insects (Day
5) , and there are many birds (Day 5) that live off
insects (Day 6).
Moreover; how would the waters 0n the earth keep from freezing for millions
of years without the sun?
In response, those who hold the concordist view say that the sun, moon, and
stars
created 0n Day
(the creation of light) or before Day
when "in
the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (Gen. 1:1), and that the
sun, moon, and stars were only made visible Or revealed on Day
(Gen:
1.14-19)
But this argument
very convincing; because all the other five
days of creation involve not revealing something that was previously created
but actually creating
for the first time. Moreover; the creative
statements are similar t0 those of other days; "And God said, 'Let there be
lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night
give light upon the earth:
And it was S0"
(Gen: 1.14-15). This
the form
of language used in verses
6, 11, 20, and 24 for
nOr
revealing them
Furthermore, the creation (not the
revealing) of the sun,
moon
and stars is made explicit in the next sentence:
And God made the tWO
great lights_
the greater light to rule the
and the lesser light tO rule the
night; he made the stars also'
(Gen: 1:16). Here the word
'made" (Heb:
asah) is the same word used when God made the firmament; the beasts of the
earth
and man (Gen. 1.7
26)
-in none of these cases is
used t0 speak
revealing something previously made:
The Hebrew
usuh is also the word
used in the summary
verse 31: "And God saw everything that he had made
and behold, it was very good:
This frequent use throughout Genesis
makes
it very unlikely that Genesis 1:16 merely refers t0 the revealing of the sun_
moon, and stars_
But
modification of the day-age view in response
these objections seems
(Day

possible The verbs in Genesis 1:16 can be taken as perfects_
indicating
something that God had done before:
And God had made the two
lights, the greater light to rule the day; and the lesser light to rule the night; he
had made
the stars also.
Grammatically this is possible (this is how the
NIV translates the same verb form in 2.8 and 2.19,for example) This view
would imply that God had made the sun, moon, and stars earlier (in v
the
creation of heavens and earth; Or in v 3, the creation of light) but only placed
them near the earth on Day 4, or allowed them
be seen from the earth on
Day
(vv 14-15,17-18). This allows the word made
asah) t0 mean
created" and thus avoids the difficulty mentioned above with the view that it
means "revealed" in verse 16. This
remains as
genuine possibility for
the day-age view; and in fact this view is the one that seems most
persuasive
to the present author; if an old earth position is t0 be adopted_
With
regard to
light needed for the plants and warmth needed for the waters, there was light
available from Day
even if we are nOt sure whether this light was light
from the sun and stars Or the light of God's glory (which
replace the sun
in the New Jerusalem, Rev: 21.23).
Another answer from the day-age view might be that the fourth day is not
exactly in sequence; though an overall outline of progressive work of God is
given. Yet once we begin changing the sequence of events that is SO
prominent
this progression of six creative days_
is doubtful that
need
allow the text to tell us anything other than the bare fact that God created
but in that case
the whole inquiry about the age of the earth is
unnecessary: (Further discussion of disruption in the sequence of days is
given in the next section )
(2) Literary Framework View: Another way of interpreting the
Genesis
has gained
significant following among evangelicals. Since
argues that Genesis
gives Us no information about the age of the earth;
would be compatible with current scientific estimates of
very old earth: This
view argues that the six days of Genesis
are nOr intended t0 indicate
chronological sequence of events, but are rather
literary "framework;
which the author uses t0 teach us about God $ creative activity. The
framework is skillfully constructed s0 that the first three days and the second
three days correspond
each other:
Days of forming
Days of

1: Light and darkness
Day 4: Sun, moon, and
great
option _
Wul

Day
separated
stars
(lights in the heaven)
Day 2: Sky and waters
Day 5: Fish and birds
separated
3: Dry land and seas
Day 6: Animals and man
separated, plants and trees
In this way
parallel construction
seen:
On Day
God separates light and
darkness
while on
he puts the sun, moon, and stars
the light and in
the darkness.
he separates the waters and the sky; while on
he puts the fish in the waters and the birds in the sky: On Day
he separates
the dry land and the seas and makes plants t0 grow; while on Day 6 he puts
the animals and man on the dy land and gives the plants
them for food
According
the
framework" view; Genesis
should not be read as though
the author wanted t0 inform us about the sequence of days or the order in
which
were created_
did he intend
tell us about the
length of time
the creation took: The arrangement of six "days" is
literary device the
author uses
teach that God created
everything:
The six
days_
which are
neither twenty-four-hour
nor
periods of
give us six different
pictures
of creation; telling us that God made all aspects of the creation
that
the pinnacle of his creative activity was man, and that over all creation is God
himself; who rested on the seventh day and who calls man therefore to
worship him on the sabbath day as well
In the words of
recent advocate of this position;
"Chronology has no place
here
The attractions in favor of this hypothesis are
the neat
coreS
pondence between the
as shown in the table above, (2) the
fact that it avoids any conflict with modern science over the age of the earth
and the age of living creatures (since no chronology at all is implied), (3) the
way it avoids the conflict of sequence between Genesis
and 2 in which man
(Gen: 2.7) seems to be formed before plants
Gen.
2.8) and animals (Gen:
2.19),
sequence different from Genesis
and
the fact that Genesis 2.5

Several points may be made against the framework theory
First, the proposed correspondence between the days of creation is nOt
nearly as exact as its advocates have supposed
The sun, moon, and stars
created on the fourth day as "lights in the firmament of the heavens'
(Gen:
1.14) are placed not in any space created on Day
but in the
firmament"
(Heb
raqia
that was created on the second day: In fact, the correspondence
language is quite explicit: this "firmament"
not mentioned at all on
but five times on Day 2 (Gen: 1: 6-8) and three times on Day
(Gen: 1.14
19). Of course
Day
also has corespondences with
(in terms of day
and night; light and darknessF
but if we say that the second three
show
the creation of
to fill the forms or spaces created on the first three days,
then Day
overlaps at least as much with Day
does with Day
Moreover; the parallel
between
and
is not exact, because in some
ways the preparation of
space for the fish and birds of Day
does not come
in Day
but in Day 3_
It is not until Day 3 that God gathers the waters
together and calls them
seas
(Gen: 1.10), and on Day
the fish are
commanded t0 "fill the waters in the seas
(Gen: 1.22). Again in verses 26
and 28 the fish are called "fish of the sea,
giving repeated emphasis t0 the
fact that the sphere the fish inhabit was specifically formed on Day
Thus
the fish formed on Day 5 seem tO
belong much more t0 the place prepared for
them on
than to the widely dispersed waters below the firmament on
Day
Establishing
paralleL
between Day 2 and Day 5 faces further
difficulties in that nothing is created on Day
to inhabit the
waters above the
firmament;
and the
created on this
(the Hebrew word
would include flying insects as well as birds) not only fly in the sky created
on Day
but also live and multiply on the
earth'
land" created on
Day 3. (Note God's command on Day 5: "Let birds multiply on the earth"
[Gen: 1.22] ) Finally; the paralleL
between Days 3 and
is not precise, for
nothing is created on Day
t0 fill the seas that were gathered together on Day
With all of these points of imprecise correspondence and overlapping
between places and
created to fill them, the supposed literary
"framework;
while having an initial appearance
neatness_
tums ouC [0 be
less and less convincing upon closer reading of the text
Since all proposals for
understanding Genesis
attempr [0
provide
explanations for scientific data about the age of the earth, this is not
unique
argument
favor of the framework theory. However; we
recognize that
one aspect of the attractiveness of this theory is the fact that
relieves
evangelicals of the burden of even trying
reconcile scientific findings with
Genesis
Yet; in the words of one advocate of this theory;
So great is the

"dry

advantage_
and for some the relief; that
could constitute
temptation:
wisely adds, "We must not espouse the theory on grounds of its convenience
but only if the text leads us in that direction:
3. Those who have not adopted the framework theory have seen no conflict in
sequence between Genesis
and 2, for it has been commonly understood that
Genesis
implies no description of sequence in the original creation of the
animals 0r plants, but simply recapitulates some of the details of Genesis
important for the
specific account of the creation of Adam and Eve in Genesis
2. The NIV avoids the appearance of conflict by
translating:
"Now the LORD
God had planted
in the
in Eden" (Gen. 2.8) and "Now the
LORD God had formed Out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the
birds of the air" (Gen. 2.19).
Genesis 2.5 does not really say that plants were not on the earth because
the earth was too dry t0 support them: If we adopt that reasoning we would
also have to say there were no plants because "there was no man
till the
ground" (Gen. 2.5) , for that is the second half of the comment about no rain
coming on the earth_
Moreover; the remainder of the sentence says that the
earth was the opposite of being tOo dry to support plants: "streams came up
from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground" (Gen: 2:6 NIV)
The statement in Genesis 2.5 is simply to be understood as an explanation of
the general time frame
which God created man.
Genesis 2.4-6 sets the
stage, telling US that
'no plant of the field was yet in the
and no herb of
the field had yet sprung up
for the LORD God had not caused it tO rain upon
the earth, and there was no man t0 till the ground
but
mist went up from the
earth and watered the whole face of the ground-
The statements about lack of
rain and no man t0 till the
ground do not give the physical reason why there
were no plants, but only explain that God $ work of creation was not
complete
This introduction puts us back into the first six days of creation as
general setting
into "the
that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens" (Gen. 2.4).
Then in that setting it abruptly introduces the main point
of chapter 2
the creation of man. The Hebrew text does not include the word
at the
beginning of verse
but simply begins,
And the LORD God
formed man
(Gen: 2.7 KJV)
5. Finally; the strongest argument against the framework view; and the reason
why comparatively few evangelicals have adopted it is that the whole of
Genesis
strongly suggests not just
literary framework but a chronological
sequence ot events
When the narrative proceeds from the less complex
aspects of creation (light and darkness_
walers_
sky, and dry land) to the more
garden _
East ,
carth
day
"then"
complex aspects (fish and birds, animals and man) we see
progressive build-
up and an ordered sequence of events that are entirely understandable
chronologically When
sequence of numbers (1-2-3-4-5-6) is attached t0
set of
that correspond exactly to the ordinary week human beings
experience (Day
Day 2 , Day 3, Day 4,
Day 5, Day 6, Day 7, with rest on
Day
the implication of chronological sequence in the narrative is almost
inescapable: The sequence of
seems more clearly intended than
literary
framework which is nowhere made explicit in the text; and in which many
details simply do not fit: As Derek Kidner observes:
The march of the
too majestic
progress t0 carry no
implication of ordered sequence; it also seems over-subtle t0 adopt a
view of the passage which discounts one of the primary impressions
makes on the ordinary reader: It is
story; not only
starement.
A sequence of days is also implied in God 's command to human beings to
imitate his pattern of work plus rest: "Remember the sabbath day; to keep it
holy. Six
you shall labor; and do all your work; but the seventh
sabbath to the LORD your God
for in six days the LORD made heaven and
earth, the sea
and all that is in them; and rested the seventh day" (Ex: 20.8
11). But if God did not create the earth by
for six
and resting on
the seventh, then the command t0 imitate him would be misleading or make
n0 sense.
In conclusion, while the "framework" view does not deny the truthfulness of
Scripture_
an interpretation of Scripture which; upon closer
inspection, seems very unlikely:
Young Earth" Theories of Creation: Another group of evangelical
interpreters rejects the dating systems that curently give an age of millions of
years
the
and argue instead that the earth is quite young_
perhaps
10,000 to 20,000 years old. Young earth advocates have produced
number
of scientific arguments for
recent creation of the earth:
Those who hold tO
young earth generally advocate one or both of the following positions:
Creation With an Appearance of Age (Mature Creationism): Many
who hold t0
young earth point out that the original creation muSt have had
appearance of age'
even from the first day: (Another term for this view is
mature creationism;
since
affirms that God created
mature creation.)
The appearance of Adam and Eve as
full-grown adults is an obvious example
They appeared
though they had lived for perhaps twenty 01
Wweml -
five
years, growing up from infancy as human beings normally do_
but in fact they

were less than
old. Similarly; they probably saw the stars the first night
that
lived
but the light from mOSt stars would take thousands or even
millions of years t0 reach the earth: This suggests that God created the stars
with light beams already in place
And full-grown trees would probably have
had rings (Adam and Eve would not have had t0 wait years before God told
them which trees of the garden they could eat from and which they could not;
nor would
have had to wait weeks Or months before edible plants grew
enough to provide them food) Following this line of
reasoning; might
we go further and suppose that many geological formations
when
originally
created, had
similar appearance t0 formations that would nOw take
thousands or even millions of years t0 complete by present
slow'
processes?
This suggestion has currently found many supporters, and, initially at least, it
seems t0 be an attractive proposal. Those who hold this position often
combine
with certain objections
curent scientific
processes:
question how
can be certain of the reliability
radiometric dating beyond
few thousand years
for example, and how scientists can know that the rates
of decay of certain elements have been constant since creation. They also
suggest that events such as the fall and the subsequent
of nature
(which altered the productivity and ecological balance of the earth, and
caused man himself to begin t0 age and decay; Gen. 3.17-19), or the flood in
Noah
time (Gen. 6-9), may have brought about significant differences in the
amount of radioactive material in living things. This would mean that
estimates of the age of the earth using present methods of measurement would
not be accurate:
common objection t0 this
appearance of age
view is that it "makes God
an apparent deceiver;
something that is contrary to his nature: But is God
"deceiver" if he creates
mature man and woman in a
and then tells uS
explicitly that he did it? Or if he creates mature fish and animals and full
grown trees and tells us that he did it? Or if he allows Adam and Eve to see
the stars, which he created in order that people might see them and give glory
him, on the first night that they lived? Rather than manifesting deception, it
seems that these actions point t0 God $ infinite wisdom and power: This is
particularly so if God explicitly tells us that he created
everything in "six
days_
According
this position; those who are deceived are those who
refuse
hear God
own explanation of how the creation came aboul:
The real problem with the appearance of age view is that there are some
things in the universe that
cannot easily account for: Everyone will agree
that Adam and Eve were created as adults_
not newborn infants
and therefore
had an
appearance of age. Most who hold

would also say there was an appearance of age with plants and trees, and
with all the animals when they were first created (the chicken came before the
egg
and
probably with light from the stars_
But the creation of fossils
presents
real problem; for responsible Christians would not want tO suggest
that God scattered fossils throughout the earth [0 give an added appearance of

would not be creating something "in process
state of
maturity;
would be
the remains of

animal could serve Adam and Eve, but simply to make people think the earth
was older than
really was
Furthermore_
one would have t0 say that God
created all these dead animals and called them
very good.
While the creation of stars with light beams in place Or trees that are mature
would be for the purpose of enabling human beings t0 glorify God for the
excellence of his creation_
the
depositing of fossils in the earth could only be
for the purpose of -
misleading
deceiving human
regarding the earlier
history of the world
More problematic is that Adam; the plants_
the animals,
and the stars all would have appeared to have different ages (because they
were created with mature functions in place); whereas modern geological
research gives approximately the same age estimates from radiometric dating
astronomical
estimates, rock formations, samples of moon rocks and
meteorites, etc. Why would God create S0 many different indications of an
earth that is 4.5 billion years old if this were not true? Would it not be better
tO conclude that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, and that God left many
indications there to show us this fact rather than in any way imply that he
deceived us? So it seems the only credible explanations for the fossil record
that Christians can adopt are:
current dating methods are incorrect by
colossal
proportions because of flawed assumptions or because of changes
brought about by the fall or the flood; or (b
current
methods are
approximately correct and the earth is many millions 0r even billions of years
old_
Flood
Geology: Another common view among evangelicals is what may
be called "flood
geology
This is the view that the tremendous natural forces
unleashed by the flood at the time of Noah (Gen: 6-9) significantly altered the
face of the earth, causing the creation of coal and diamonds
for example_
within the space of
year rather than hundreds of millions of years
because
of the extremely high pressure exerted by the water on the earth. This view
also claims that the flood deposited fossils in layers of incredibly thick
sediment all over the earth_
The flood geology view is also called
neo-
catastrophism
because itS advocales attribute most of the present
geological
status of the earth to the immense catastrophe of the flood_
This
creating
beings
dating
The geological arguments put forth by advocates of this view are technical
and difficult for the nonspecialist tO evaluate. Personally; though
think the
flood of Genesis 6-9 was world-wide, and that it did have
significant impact
on the face of the earth, and that all living people and animals outside the ark
perished in the flood_
am not persuaded that all of the earth's geological
formations
caused by Noah's flood rather than by millions of years of
sedimentation, volcanic eruptions, movement of glaciers, continental drift;
and s0 forth: The controversy over flood geology is strikingly different from
the other areas of dispute regarding creation, for its advocates have persuaded
almost no professional geologists_
even those who are
Bible-believing
evangelical Christians. By contrast, the books objecting t0 evolution that we
mentioned above chronicle 130 years of cogent objections to Darwinian
evolution that have been raised by
significant number of biologists
biochemists, zoologists, anthropologists
and
paleontologists_
both Christian
and non-Christian, because evolution has S0 many problems in
explaining
facts evident from observation of the created world. If present geological
formations could only be explained as the result of
universal flood, then
would this nor be evident even t0 non-Christians who look at the evidence?
Would not the hundreds of Christians who are professional geologists be
prepared
acknowledge the evidence
were there?
may be that the
flood geologists are right, but if
are,
would expect tO see more
progress in persuading some professional geologists that their case is
plausible one
Conclusions 0n the Age of the Earth
How old is the earth then? Where
does this discussion leave Us? Young
arguments for an old earth based on
many kinds of scientific data from different disciplines seem (tO the present
writer at least) to be very strong:
This is particularly true of arguments based
on fossil-
rocks; coral reefs, continental drift; and the similarity of
results from different kinds of radiometric dating: Newman and Eckelmann'$
arguments from astronomy
indicating
very old universe give significant
added weight
is understandable
on the one hand, that God may have
crealed
universe in which stars appeared to have been shining for 15 billion
years_
Adam appeared
have been living for 25 years, some trees appeared
to have been living for 50 years
and some animals appeared t0 have been
t0 10 years.
But, on the other hand, it is difficult to understand
why God would have created dozens or perhaps hundreds of different kinds
of rocks and minerals on the earth; all of which actually were only one day
old_
but all of which had an appearance of
exactly 4.5 billion years old
exactly the apparent age that he also
the moon and the meteorites
when
too_
were only one day old. And it is difficult tO understand why
were

gave

the evidence of star life
and the expansion of the universe would make
the universe appear to be 15 billion years old if it were not: It is possible
but
it seems
unlikely; almost as if God $ only purpose in giving these uniform
apparent ages was t0 mislead us rather than simply to have
mature,
functioning universe in place. So the old earth advocates seem to me to have
greater weight of scientific evidence on their side, and
seems that the
weight of evidence is
increasing yearly:
On the other hand, the interpretations of Genesis
presented by old earth
advocates_
while possible
do not seem as natural t0 the sense of the texc
Davis Young
own solution of
seven successive figurative
indeterminate duration'
really does not solve the problem; for he is willing
spread God'$ creative activities around O the various days as needed in
order t0 make the sequence scientifically possible
For example, he thinks that
some birds were created before
We may also suggesC
that even though birds were created on the fifth
day; nevertheless, the most primitive birds or original bird ancestors
were miraculously formed on
day prior t0 the fifth day. Hence the
data of Genesis
actually allow for some overlap of the events of the
days. If such overlap exists, then all apparent discrepancies between
Genesis
and science would fall away (chapter 6).
But this procedure allows US to say that the events of creation occurred at
almost any time, no matter whether Scripture says they occurred then or not:
Once this procedure
adopted_
then
ultimately we can know little if
anything
about the sequence of creation events from Genesis
because any of the
events narrated there may have had precursors at previous periods of time_
This can hardly be the impression the originab
readers were intended to get
from the text_ (Much more
however; is the modified day-age view
presented above:)
The Need for Further
Understanding: Although our conclusions are
tentative, at this point in our
understanding; Scripture seems to be more easily
understood t0 suggest (but not [0 require)
young earth view; while the
observable facts of creation seem increasingly t0 favor an old earth view:
Both views are possible; but neither one is certain_
And we must say very
clearly that the age of the earth is
matter that is not directly taught in
Scripture_
but is
something
we can think about only by drawing more 0r less
probable inferences from Scripture. Given this situation; it would seem best
(1) to admit that God may not allow US t0 find
clear solution t0 this question
before Christ returns_
and (2) [0 encourage
evangelical
scientists and
cycles
days
Day
likely;
theologians who fall in both the young earth and old earth camps t0 begin to
work together with much less arrogance
much more humility, and
much
greater sense of cooperation in
common purpose.
There are difficulties with both old earth and young earth viewpoints
difficulties that the proponents of each view often seem unable t0 see in their
own positions Progress will certainly be made if old earth and young earth
scientists who are Christians will be more
to (alk to each other without
hostility, ad hominem attacks, or highly emotiona
accusations
on the one
hand, and without
spirit ot condescension
academic pride on the other;
for these attitudes are not
becoming to the body of Christ, nor are
characteristic of the way of wisdom; which is "first pure, then peaceable
gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty 01
insincerity;
and full of the recognition that "the harvest of righteousness is
sown in peace by those who make peace
(James 3.17-18).
As for
evangelism and apologetics done in publications designed to be read
outside the
evangelical world, young earth and old earth proponents could
cooperate much more in
amassing the extremely strong arguments for
creation by intelligent design, and
laying aside their differences over the
age of the earth. Too often young earth proponents have failed to distinguish
scientific arguments for creation by design from scientific arguments for
young earth; and have therefore prevented old earth advocates from
joining
them in
battle for the minds of an unbelieving scientific community:
Moreover; young earth proponents have sometimes failed
recognize that
scientific arguments for
young earth (which seem t0 them to be very
persuasive) are not nearly as strong as the overwhelming scientific arguments
for creation Dy
intelligent design
result, young earth proponents have
too often given the impression that the only true
creationists" are those who
believe not only in creation by God but also in
young earth: The result has
been unfortunate divisiveness and lack of community among scientists who
are Christians
the delight of Satan and the grieving of God 's Holy Spirit:
Finally;
we can view this controversy with some expectancy that there will be
further progress
scientific understanding of the age of the earth. It is likely
that scientific research in the next ten Or [wenty years will tip the weight of
evidence decisively toward either
young earth or an old earth view; and the
weight of Christian scholarly opinion (from both biblical scholars and
scientists) will begin to shift decisively in one direction 0r another: This
should not cause alarm t0 advocates of either position, because the
truthfulness of Scripture
not threatened (our interpretations of Genesis
have enough uncertainty that either position is possible). Both sides need to

position:
Appicahon
The doctrine of creation has many applications for Christians today. It makes
us realize that the material universe is good in itself; for God created it
and wants US [0 use
in ways pleasing to him. Therefore we should seek to be
like the early Christians_
who
'partook of food with glad and generous hearts"
(Acts 2.46), always with thanksgiving
God and trust in his provisions_
healthy appreciation of creation will keep us from false asceticism that denies
the goodness of creation and the blessings that come t0 uS through it: It will
also encourage some Christians to do scientific and technological research
into the goodness of God's abundant creation; Or t0 support such research
The doctrine of creation will also enable us to recognize more clearly that
scientific and technological study in itself glorifies God, for it enables US t0
discover how incredibly wise, powerful, and skillful God was in his work of
creation:
Great
are the works of the LORD, studied by all who have pleasure
in them'
(Ps. 111.2).
The doctrine of creation also reminds Us that God is sovereign over the
universe he created. He made it all, and he is Lord of all of it. We owe all that
we are and have to him; and we may have complete confidence that he will
ultimately defeat all his enemies and be manifested as Sovereign
worshiped forever: In addition, the incredible size of the universe and the
amazing complexity of every created thing will, if
hearts are right; draw
us continually to worship and praise him for his greatness_
Finally, as we indicated above,
wholeheartedly enjoy creative
activities (artistic, musical, athletic, domestic; literary; etc:) with an attitude of
thanksgiving that our Creator God enables us t0 imitate him in Our creativity.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Are there ways in which you could be more thankful to God for the
excellence of his creation? Look around you and give some examples of
the goodness of the creation that God has allowed yOu to enjoy: Are
there ways in which you could be
better steward of parts of God' $
creation of which he has entrusted t0 YOur care?
Might the goodness of all that God created encourage YOu tO try to enjoy
different kinds of foods than those YOu normally prefer? Can children be
taught t0 thank God for variety in the
God has given US tO eat?
Does the doctrine of creation provide an answer t0 some strict animal
long-
good
King
OM
things
rights advocates who say we should not eat steak or chicken or other
meat,
wear
clothing made from animal skins_
since
are simply
another form of animal ourselves? (See Gen. 3.21.)
In order 0 understand
something of the despair felt by contemporary
non-Christians, just try tO imagine for
moment that you believe that
there is no God and that YOu are just
product of matter plus time plus
chance
the spontaneous result of random variation in
organisms
Ovel
millions of years.
How would you feel differently about yourself? About
other people? About the future? About right and wrong?
Why do we feel joy when
are able to "subdue'
even
of the
eartn
and make
useful for serving 4S
whether it be in growing
vegetables, developing
better kind of plastic or metal, Or using wool tO
knic
piece of clothing? Should we feel joy at the accomplishment of
these and other tasks? What other attitudes of heart should we feel as we
do them?
When you think about the immensity of the stars, and that God put them
in place to show us his power and glory; how does it make you feel about
your place in the universe? Is this different from the way
non-
Christian
would feel?
Before reading this chapter; what did yOu think about the theory of
evolution? How has your view changed_
if at all?
What are some
that Christians can learn about theological
discussion in general
observing the curent controversy over the
age of the earth? What
significance do you see in this controversy for
your own Christian faith?

Chapter 16
God's Providence
If God controls all things, how can our actions have real
meaning? What are the decrees of God?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Once
understand that God is the all-powerful Creator (see chapter 15), it
seems reasonable
conclude that he also preserves and govems everything in
the universe as well. Though the term providence is not found in Scripture;
has been traditionally used to summarize God'$
ongoing relationship
creation: When we accept the biblical doctrine of providence_
avoid four
common errors in
thinking about God'$ relationship to creation: The biblical
doctrine is not deism (which teaches that God created the world and then
essentially abandoned it), nor pantheism (which teaches that the creation does
not have
real, distinct existence in itself; but is only part of God); but
providence, which teaches that though God is actively related to and involved
in the creation at each moment; creation is distinct from him. Moreover; the
biblical doctrine does not teach that events in creation are determined by
chance (0r"
randomness), nor are they determined by impersonal
fate (or
determinism), buc by God
who is the personal yet infinitely powerful Creator
and Lord
We may define God $ providence as follows: God is continually involved with
all created
in such
way that he (1) keeps them existing and
maintaining the properties with which he created them;
cooperates with
created things in every action, directing tneir distinctive properties
cause
them [0 act as they
and (3) directs them to fulfill his purposes:
Under the general category of providence we have three subtopics, according
the three elements
the definition above:
Preservation; (2)
Concurrence, and (3) Govemment:
We shall examine each of these separately, then consider
differing views and
objections t0 the doctrine of providence. It should be noted that this is
doctrine on which there has been substantial
eement among Christians
things
do;
disagre
since the early history of the church, particularly with respect to God s
relationship to the
choices of moral creatures. In this chapter we will
first present
summary of the position favored in this textbook (what is
commonly called the "Reformed" or "Calvinist" position),
then consider
arguments that have been made from another position (what is commonly
called the
Arminian" position).
Pre_cNation
God keeps all created things existing and maintaining the properties with
which he created them:
Hebrews 1.3 tells uS that Christ is
upholding the universe by his word of
power:
The Greek word translated "upholding
is phero,
bear:
This
commonly used in the New Testament for canying something from one
place to another; such as bringing
paralyzed man on
bed t0 Jesus (Luke
5.18), bringing wine tO the steward of the feast (John 2.8) , or
bringing
cloak
and books t0 Paul (2
4.13). It does not mean simply
sustain;
but has
the sense of active, purposeful control over the
carried from one
place to another: In Hebrews 1.3, the use of the present participle indicates
that Jesus is
continually carrying along all things
in the universe by his
word of power: Christ is actively involved in the work of providence.
Similarly, in Colossians 1:17_
Paul says of Christ that "in him all
hold
together:
The phrase "all things" refers tO every created thing in the universe
(see
16) , and the verse affirms that Christ keeps all
existing
they continue t0 exist Or
endure
(NASB mg:
Both verses indicate that

exist. Such
is also affirmed by Paul when he says_

have our being
(Acts 17.28), and by Ezra:
You are the LORD; YOu alone;
YOu have made heaven, the heaven of heavens_
with all their host, the earth
and all that is 0n it; the seas and all that is in them; and YOu preserve all of
them; and the host of heaven worships
(Neh: 9.6). Peter also says that
"the heavens and earth that nOW exist" are
kept until the day of
judgment" (2 Peter 3.7).
One aspect of God'$ providential preservation is the fact that he continues t0
give us breath each moment: Elihu in his wisdom says of God
"If he should
take back his spirit to himself; and gather
himself his breath; all flesh
would perish together; and man would retum to dust" (Job 34.14-15; cf. Ps.
104.29).

preserves the earth and the creation that he has made:
We should not; however; think of God'$ preservation as
continuous new
creation: he does not continuously create new atoms and molecules for every
existing thing every moment. Rather; he preserves what has already been
created: he
carries
by his word of power (Heb_

translation) We must also appreciate that created things are real and that their
characteristics are real:

~it is hard_

do not just imagine that

it does hurt! Because God keeps this rock maintaining the properties with

This second aspect of providence; concurrence, is an expansion of the idea
contained in the first aspect; preservation. In
some
theologians (such as
John Calvin) treat the fact of concurrence under the category of preservation;
but it is helpful tO treat it as
distinct category:
In Ephesians 1:11 Paul says that God

the counsel of his will.

human beings_
Inanimate Creation: There are many
in creation that we think of as
merely
natural" occurences. Yet Scripture says that God causes them to
happen. We read of "fire and hail, snow and frost, stormy wind fulfilling his
commandl" (Ps. 148.8) . Similarly;
To the snow he says, "Fall on the

on the face of the habitable world
Whether for correction, or for his land,

or for love_
he causes it to happen:
(Job 37.6-13; cf. similar statements in 38.22
J0)
Again, the psalmist declares that
Whatever the LORD pleases he does, in
heaven and on earth,
the seas and all deeps'
(Ps. 135.6), and then in the
next sentence he illustrates God '$ doing of his will in the weather: "He it is
who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth_
who makes
lightnings for
the rain and
forth the wind from his storehouses'
(Ps. 135.7; cf: 104.4).
God also causes the grass t0 grow:
You cause the grass
grow for the
cattle, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the
earth" (Ps. 104.14). God directs the stars in the heavens, asking Job, "Can you
bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its
cubs?-
(Job 38.32 NIV; "the Bear" or Ursa Major is commonly called the Big
Dipper;
31 refers t0 the constellations Pleiades and Orion) Moreover; God
continually directs the coming of the morning (Job 38.12),
tact Jesus
affirmed when he said that God "makes his sun rise on the evil and on the
good, and sends rain on the
ust and on the unjust" (Matt: 5.45).
2. Animals. Scripture affirms that God feeds the wild animals of the field, for;
"These all look to you
give them their food in due season_
When YOu give
[0 them,
it up; when you open your hand,
are filled with good
things_
When you hide your face; they are dismayed" (Ps. 104.27-29; cf: Job
38.39-41). Jesus also affirmed this when he said, "Look at the birds of the air
your heavenly Father feeds them
(Matc_ 6.26).
And he said that not one
sparrow "will fall to the
ground without your Father"
will" (Matt: 10.29).
Seemingly "Random
or "Chance" Events. From
human perspective,
the
of lots (or its modern equivalent; the
of dice 0r
flipping of
coin) is the most Lypical of random events that occur in the universe. But
Scripture affirms that the outcome of such an event is from God: "The lot is
cast into the lap_
but the decision is wholly from the LORD" (Prov: 16.33).
Events Fully Caused by God and Fully Caused by the Creature as
Well: For any of these
foregoing events (rain and Snow; grass growing_
sun
and stars_
the
feeding of animals
casting of lots), we could (at least in
theory) give
completely satisfactory "natural" explanation_
botanist can
detail the factors that cause grass
grow, such as sun, moisture; temperature;
nutrients in the soil, etc.
Yet Scripture says that God causes the grass t0 grow:

we should thank him. If crops grow we should thank him. In all of these
events _
it is nOt aS though the event was partly caused by God and partly by
factors in the created world: If that were the case_
then we would always be
for some small feature of an event that we could not explain and
attribute that (say
percent of the cause) to God. But surely this is not a
correct view: Rather; these passages affirm that such events are entirely
caused by God. Yet we know that (in another sense) they are entirely caused
by factors in the creation as well:
The doctrine of concurrence affirms that God directs, and works through; the
distinctive properties of each created
so that these
themselves
bring about the results that we
In this way it is possible t0 affirm that in
one sense events are
(100 percent) caused by God and fully (100
percent) caused by the creature as well. However; divine and creaturely
causes work in different ways

created thing brings about actions in ways consistent with the creature

properties, ways that can often be described by US or by professional scientists
who carefully observe the processes.
These creaturely factors and properties

causes of everything that happens_
even though
are the causes that are evident to us by observation:
The Affairs of Nations. Scripture also speaks of God's providential control
of human affairs
We read that God
makes nations great; and he destroys
them: he
enlarges nations_
and leads them away" (Job 12.23). "Dominion

the LORD, and he rules over the nations
(Ps. 22.28). He has
determined the time of existence and the place of every nation on the earth,
for Paul says_
~he made from one every nation of men tO live on all the face
of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their

and he does according to his will in the host of heaven
and among the inhabitants of the earth;
and none can stay his hand 0r say to him;
"What are you doing?
(Dan. 4.34-35)
AlI Aspects of Our Lives: It is amazing t0 see the extent t0 which
Scripture affirms that God brings about various events in our lives. For
example_
dependence on God to give us food each day is affirmed every
time we pray;
Give US this day our daily bread" (Matt: 6.11), even though we
work for our food and (as far as mere human observation can discern) obtain
it through entirely
natural" causes. Similarly; Paul, looking at events with the
eye of faith, affirms that "my God will supply every need" of his children
(Phil 4.19) , even though God may use "ordinary"
means (such as other
people) tO do s0
God plans our
before we are born, for David affirms; "In your book were
written_
every one of them, the
that were formed for me
when as yet
there was none of them"
(Ps. 139.16).
And Job says that man'$
determined_
and the number of his months
with YOu; and yOu have
appointed his bounds that he cannot pass'
(Job 14.5).
This can be seen in the
life of Paul, who says that God "had set me apart before
was born" (Gal:
1.15), and Jeremiah; tO whom God said, "Before
formed you in the womb
knew you; and before YOu were born
consecrated you;
appointed you _
prophet to the nations
(Jer: 1.5).
All our actions are under God $ providential care , for "in him we live and
move
(Acts 17.28). The individual steps we take each
are directed by the
Lord. Jeremiah confesses; "[know; 0 LORD, that the way of man is not in
himself, that
is not -
man who walks t0 direct his steps'
(Jer: 10.23). We
read thal
man
steps are ordered by the LORD'
(Prov: 20.24), and that "a
man"
mind plans his way; but the LORD directs his steps'
(Prov: 16.9).
Similarly, Proverbs 16.1 affirms, "The plans of the mind belong

but
the answer of the tongue is from the LORD_
Success and failure come from God, for we read,

can say, "He has put down the mighty from their thrones_
and exalted
those of low degree'
(Luke 1.52). The LORD gives children, for children
are
heritage from the LORD
the fruic of the womb

All our talents and abilities are from the Lord, for Paul can ask the
Corinthians
What have YOu that yOu did not receive? [f then you received it;
why do you boast as

David knew that to be
true regarding his military skill, for; though he must have trained many hours
in the use 0f
bow and arrow; he could say of God_
"He trains my hands for
war; s0 that my arms can bend
bow of bronze'
(Ps. 18.34).
God influences rulers in their decisions, for "the king
heart is
stream of
water in the hand of the LORD; he turns
wherever he will" (Prov: 21:1). An
illustration of this was when the Lord "turned the heart of the

his people;
'So that he aided them in the work of the house of
God

and "fashions the hearts of them all" (Ps. 33.14-15).
When we realize that the heart in Scripture is the location of our inmost
thoughts and desires, this is
significant passage. God especially
the
desires and inclinations of believers, working in us "both to will and t0 work
for his
pleasure
(Phil. 2.13).
All of these passages, reporting both general statements about God s work in
the lives of all people and specific examples of God'$ work in the lives of
individuals, lead us to conclude that God $ providential work of concurence
extends to all aspects of our lives_
Our words, our steps; OUI movements_

One approach
these passages about God $ concurence
to say that if our
choices are real, they cannot be caused by God (see below for further
discussion of this viewpoint).
But the number of passages that affirm this

giving them some other interpretation are s0 formidable, that it does not seem

Exactly how God combines his providential control with our willing and

But rather than deny one
aspect 0r the other (simply because we cannot explain how both can be tnue);
we should accept both in an attempt to be faithful to the
of all of
Scripture _
The
of an author
writing
play may help uS tO grasp how both
aspects can be true
In the Shakespearean play Macbeth, the character
Macbeth murders
Duncan. Now (if we assume for
moment that this is

account); the question may be asked; "Who killed King Duncan?"
On one level, the correct answer is "Macbeth:
Within the context of the play
he carried out the murder and is rightly to blame for it: But on another level;
correct answe
t0 the question,
killed
Duncan?" would be
"William Shakespeare
he wrote the play; he created all the characters in it;
and he wrote the part where Macbeth killed King Duncan:
It would not be correct t0 say that because Macbeth killed
Duncan;
William Shakespeare did not kill him_
Nor would it be correct t0 say that
because William Shakespeare killed
Duncan, Macbeth did not kill him
Both are true. On the level of the characters in the play Macbeth fully (100
percent) caused King Duncan's death; but on the level of the creator of the
play; William Shakespeare fully (100 percent) caused
Duncan'$ death_
similar fashion, we can understand that God fully causes
in one way
(as Creator), and we fully cause things in another way (as creatures)

someone may object that the

problem because characters in

are only
characters with no freedom of their Own , no ability to make genuine choices_

passages of Scripture
7. What About Evil? If God does indeed cause, through his providential
activity, everything that comes about in the world, then the question arises
"What is the relationship between God and evil in the world?" Does God
actually cause the evil actions that people do? If he does; then
God nOr
responsible for sin?
In approaching this question, it is best first [0 read the passages of Scripture
that most directly address it:
We can
begin by
at severa)
passages that
affirm that God did, indeed_
cause evil events [0 come about and evil deeds t0
be done. But
must remember that in all these passages
clear that
Scripture nowhere shows God as directly doing anything evil, but rather as
bringing about evil deeds through the willing actions of moral creatures_
Moreover; Scripture never blames God for
or shows God as taking
pleasure in evil, and Scripture never excuses human beings for the wrong they
However we understand God's relationship to evil; we must never come
to the point where we think that we are not
responsible for the evil that we do_
that God rakes pleasure
evil or is t0 be blamed for it. Such
conclusion
is clearly contrary t0 Scripture.
There are literally dozens of Scripture passages that say that God (indirectly)
brought about some kind of evil.
have quoted such an extensive list (in the
next few
paragraphs) because Christians often are unaware
the extent of
this forthright teaching in Scripture_
Yet
must be remembered that in all of
these examples, the
is actually done not by God but by people or demons
who choose [0 do it:
very clear example is found in the story of Joseph: Scripture clearly says
that Joseph
brothers were wrongly jealous of him (Gen. 37:11), hated him
(Gen. 37:4, 5, 8) , wanted to kill him (Gen. 37:20), and did wrong when they
cast him into
pit (Gen. 37.24) and then sold him into slavery in Egypt (Gen_
37.28).
Yet later Joseph could say t0 his brothers

overriding providential control of God whereby God'$ own purposes were
accomplished. Both are clearly affirmed_
The story of the exodus from Egypt repeatedly affirms that God hardened the
heart of Pharaoh: God says; "[will harden his heart" (Ex. 4.21), "[will harden
Pharaoh
heart" (Ex. 7.3) , "the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh" (Ex:
9:12), "the LoRD hardened Pharaoh 's heart" (Ex: 10.20_
repeated in 10.27 and
again in 11:10),
will harden Pharaoh s heart" (Ex: 14.4) , and "the LORD
hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypr" (Ex 14.8). It is sometimes
objected that Scripture also says that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (Ex:
8.15, 32; 9.34), and that God's act of
hardening Pharaoh's heart was only in
response to the initial rebellion and hardness of heart that Pharaoh himself
exhibited of his own free will. But
should be noted that God's promises that
he would harden Pharaoh 's heart (Ex. 4.21; 7.3) are made
before
Scripture tells us that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (we read of this for the
first time
Ex: 8.15). Moreover; our analysis of concurrence given above
which both divine and human
can cause the same event, should show
us that both factors can be true at the same time: even when Pharaoh hardens
his own heart, that is not inconsistent with saying that God is
Pharaoh
to do this and thereby God is hardening the heart of Pharaoh. Finally, if
someone
object that God is just intensifying the
desires and
choices that were already in Pharaoh
heart; then this kind of action could
still in theory at least cover all the evil in the world today; since all people
have evil desires in their hearts and all people do in fact make evil choices
What was God $ purpose in this? Paul reflects on Exodus 9.16 and says,
"For
the scripture says t0 Pharaoh,
have raised YOu up fOr the very purpose of
showing my power in you_
that my name may be proclaimed in all the
earth'
(Rom: 9.17).
Then Paul infers
general truth from this specific
example: "So then he has mercy upon whomever he wills, and he hardens the
heart of whomever he wills" (Rom. 9.18). In fact; God also hardened the
hearts of the Egyptian people s0 that they pursued Israel into the Red Sea:
will harden the hearts of the Egyptians SO that they shall g0 in after them, and
[will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen'
(Ex. 14.17). This theme
repeated
Psalm 105.25: "He turned their hearts
to hate his people:
Later in the Old Testament narrative similar examples are found of the
Canaanites who were destroyed in the conquest of Palestine under Joshua. We
read
"For it was the LORD
to harden their hearts that they should
come against Israel in battle, in order that
should be utterly destroyed"
(Josh: 11:20; see also Judg: 3.12; 9.23). And Samson'$ demand to many an

unbelieving Philistine woman "was from the LORD; for he was

At that time the Philistines had dominion

We also read that the sons of Eli, when rebuked for
their evil deeds
would not listen t0 the voice of their father; for it was the
will of the LORD
slay them"
(1 Sam 2.25). Later;
an evil spirit from the
LORD'
tormented King Saul (1 Sam: 16.14).
When David sinned
the LORD said to him through Nathan the prophet;
will
raise up
against YOu out of YOur own house
and
will take your wives
before
eyes, and give them t0 your neighbor; and he shall lie with your
wives in the sight of this sun_
For you did it secretly; but
will do this
before all Israel, and before the sun" (2 Sam: 12.11-12; fulfilled in 16.22). In
further punishment for David's sin, "the LORD struck the child that Uriah $
wife bore t0 David
and it became sick" and eventually died (2 Sam: 12.15
18).
David remained mindful of the fact that God could
evil against
him, because at
ater
time, when Shimee
cursed David and threw stones at
him and his servants (2 Sam: 16.5-8) , David refused to take vengeance on
Shimei but said tO his soldiers, "Let him alone
and let him curse; for the
LORD has bidden him" (2 Sam: 16.11).
Still later in David's life; the Lord "incited"
David t0 take
census of the
people (2 Sam: 24:1), but afterward David recognized this as sin, saying
have sinned greatly
whar
have done
(2 Sam. 24.10), and God sent
punishment on the land because of this sin (2 Sam 24.12-17). However; it is
also clear that "the anger of the LORD was kindled
Israel" (2 Sam:
24:1) , so God'$ inciting of David to sin was
means by which he brought
about punishment on the people of Israel. Moreover; the means by which God
incited David is made clear in
Chronicles 21:1: "Satan stood up against
Israel, and incited David tO number Israel
In this one incident the Bible
gives US
remarkable insight into the three influences that contributed in
different ways t0 one action: God_
in order t0 bring about his purposes
worked through Satan to incite David to sin, but Scripture
regards David as
being responsible for that sin
Again, after Solomon turned away from the
Lord because of his foreign wives, "the LORD raised up an adversary against
Solomon, Hadad the Edomite
11.14), and "God also raised up as an

Job's possessions and children, and though this harm came through the evil
actions of the Sabeans and the Chaldeans, as well as

Though he says that the LORD had done this, yet he does not blame

and neither should we
Elsewhere in the Old Testament we read that the Lord "put
lying spirit in the
mouth" of Ahab'$ prophets ( 1 Kings 22.23) and sent the wicked Assyrians as
"the rod of my
anger" to punish Israel (Isa. 10.5). He also sent the evil
Babylonians, including Nebuchadnezzar; against Israel, saying
will bring
them against this land and its inhabitants" (Jer: 25.9). Then God promised that
later he would punish the Babylonians also:

Yet we must realize
that
punishing evil in those who are not redeemed (such as Pharaoh; the
Canaanites_
and the Babylonians), God is also
glorified through the
demonstration of his justice, holiness; and power (see Ex: 9.16; Rom: 9.14-
24).

The life of Jonah is
remarkable illustration of God $ concurence in human
activity- The men on board the ship
to Tarshish threw Jonah overboard,
for Scripture says, "So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the

(Jonah 1:15). Yet only five verses later Jonah
acknowledges God'$ providential direction

(Jonah 2.3). Scripture
simultaneously affirms that the men threw Jonah into the sea and that God

divine influence on them

cried [0 the Lord for

All the actions of all the participants in the crucifixion of Jesus had been
'predestined" by God. Yet the apostles clearly attach no moral blame to God,
for the actions resulted from the
willing choices of sinful men. Peter makes
this clear in his sermon at Pentecost: "this Jesus_
delivered up according t0 the
definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands
of lawless men
(Acts 2.23). In one sentence he links God $ plan and
foreknowledge with the moral blame that attaches t0 the actions of "lawless
men:
They were not forced by God to act against their wills; rather; God
brought about his plan through their willing choices, for which they were
nevertheless responsible
In an example similar t0 the Old Testament account of God sending
lying
spirit into the mouth of Ahab'$ prophets
read of those who refuse to love
the truth; "Therefore God sends upon them
strong delusion, to make them
believe what is false; so that all may be condemned who did not believe the
truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
(2 Thess 2.11-12). And Peter tells
his readers that
who oppose them and persecute them; who reject Christ
as Messiah;,
stumble because
disobey the word, as they were destined [0
do" (1 Peter 2.8).
8. Analysis of Verses
Relating
to God and Evil:
After looking at s0 many
verses that speak of God $ providential use of the evil actions of men and
demons_
what can we say by way of
analysis?
God Uses AIL
to Fulfill His Purposes and Even Uses Evil for His
Glory and for Our Good: Thus,
when evil comes into our lives t0 trouble uS
we can have from the doctrine of providence
deeper assurance that "God
causes all things
work together for
those who love God, t0 those
who are called
according -
to his purpose
(Rom: 8.28 NASB) This kind of
conviction enabled Joseph to say t0 his brothers,
You meant evil against me;
but God meant it for
good" (Gen. 50.20).
We can also realize that God is glorified even in the punishment of evil
Scripture tells us that "the LORD has made everything for its purpose
evem
the
wicked for the
of trouble" (Prov: 16.4)_
Similarly; the psalmist affirms,
"Surely the wrath of men shall praise you" (Ps. 76.10). And the example of
Pharaoh (Rom: 9.14-24) is
clear example of the way God uses evil for his
own glory and for the good of his people:
Nevertheless_
God Never Does Evil, and Is Never to Be Blamed for
Evil: In a statement similar t0 those cited above from Acts 2.23 and 4.27-28,
Jesus also combines God $ predestination of the crucifixion with moral blame

on those who carry
out: "For the Son of man goes aS it has been
determined; but woe t0 that man by whom he is
betrayed " (Luke 22.22; cf.
Matt: 26.24; Mark 14.21). And in a more general statement about
in the
world, Jesus says, "Woe to the world for temptations tO sin! For it is necessary
that temptations come, but we

(Matt: 18.7).
James
similarly in
uS not t0 blame God for the evil we do
when he says, "Let no one say when he is tempted,
am tempted by God' =
for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one; but each
person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his Own desire
(James
1.13-14)
The verse does not say that God never causes evil; it affirms that
should never think of him as the personal agent who
rempting 4S Or who
is t0 be held accountable for the temptation.
We can never blame God for
temptation nor think that he will approve of us if we give in t0 it: We are to
resist evil and always blame ourselves 0r Others who tempt US, but we MuSt
neven
blame God_
Even
verse such as Isaiah 45.7
which
God
evil;
does not say that God himself does evil, but should be
understood to mean that God ordained that evil would come about through the
willing choices of his creatures
These verses all make it clear that "secondary causes" (human
and
angels and demons) are real, and that human
do cause evil and are
responsible for
Though God ordained that it would come about, both in
general terms and in specific details, yet God is removed from actually doing
evil, and his
bringing it about through "secondary causes
does not impugn
his holiness 0r render him blameworthy John Calvin wisely says:
Thieves and murderers and other evildoers are the instruments of
divine providence
and the Lord himself uses these t0 canry out the
judgments that he has determined with himself: Yet
deny that they
can derive from this any excuse for their evil deeds. Why? Will they
either involve God in the same iniquity with themselves,
will
cloak their own depravity with his justice? They can do neither:
A little later; Calvin heads
chapter;
God So Uses the Works of the Ungodly;
and So Bends Their Minds t0 Canry Out His Judgments, That He Remains
Pure From Every Stain_
We should notice that the alternatives
saying that God uses evil for his
purposes
but that he never does
and is not to be blamed for it; are not
desirable ones. If we were t0 say that God himself does evil, we would have

[0 conclude that he is nOr
good and righteous God_
and therefore that he is
not really God at all. On the other hand, if we maintain that God does not use
evil to fulfill his purposes, then we would have t0 admit that there is evil in
the universe that God did not intend, is not under his control, and might not
fulfill his purposes. This would make it very difficult for us t0 affirm that "all
things'
work together for good for those who love God and are called
according
his purpose (Rom: 8.28).
evil came into the world in spite of
the fact that God did not intend it and did not want it to be there, then what
guarantee do we have that there will not be more and more evil that he does
not intend and that he does not want? And what guarantee do we have that he
will be able t0 use
for his purposes; 0r even that he can triumph over it?
Surely this is an undesirable alternative position.
God Rightfully Blames and Judges Moral Creatures for the Evil They
Do: Many passages in Scripture affirm this_
One is found in [saiah: " These
have chosen their Own ways_
and their soul delights
their abominations;
also will choose affliction for them, and bring their fears upon them; because_
when
called, no one answered, when
did not listen; but -
did
what was evil in my eyes
and chose that in which
did not delight" (Isa.
66.3-4). Similarly;
read, "God made man upright, but they have sought
out many devices
(Eccl: 7.29). The blame for evil is always on the
responsible creature; whether man Or demon, who does it; and the creature
who does evil is always worthy of punishmen Scripture consistently affirms
that God is righteous and just tO punish us fOr OuI sins:
And if we object that
he should not find fault with us because we cannor resist his will, then we
must ponder the apostle Paul $ Own response t0 that question: "You will say
[0 me then;
Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?' But
who are yOu
man; t0 answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its
molder;
Why have yOu made me thus?
(Rom: 9.19-20). In every case
where
we d0
evil, we know that we
willingly choose t0 do it; and we realize
that we are rightly t0 be blamed for iL:
d. Evil Is Real; Not an llusion; and We Should Never Do Evil, for It Will
Always Harm Us and Others: Scripture consistently teaches that we
neven
have
right to do evil, and that we should persistently oppose it in ourselves
and in the world. We are t0 pray;
Deliver uS
from evil" (Matt: 6.13), and if
we see anyone
wandering from the truth and doing wrong
we should attempt
bring him back: Scripture says, "If any one among YOu wanders from the
truth and someone brings him back; let him know that whoever brings back a
sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover _
multitude of sins
(James 5.19-20). We should never even will evil to be

what Paul says about people who teach that false doctrine: "Their

3.8).
thinking about God using evil to
his purposes,
should remember
that there are
that are right for God t0 do but wrong for US t0 do: He
requires others t0 worship him; and he accepts worship from them. He seeks
glory for himself: He

He also
uses evil to
about good purposes, but he does not allow uS to do so.
Calvin quotes
statement of Augustine with approval: "There is _
great
difference between what is
for man to will and what is fitting for
God
For through the bad
of evil men God fulfills what he
righteously wills
And Herman Bavinck uses the
parent who
himself use
very sharp knife but will not allow his child to use it, to
show that God himself uses evil to
about good purposes but never
allows his children t0 do so. Though we are tO imitate God's moral character
many ways (cf: Eph 5.1), this is one of the ways
which we are not t0
imitate him
In Spite of All of the Foregoing Statements, We Have to Come tO the
Point Where We Confess That We Do Not Understand How It Is That
God Can Ordain That We Carry Out Evil Deeds and Yet Hold Us
Accountable for Them and Not be Blamed Himself: We can affirm thar all
of these things are true; because Scripture teaches them: But Scripture does
not tell us exactly how God brings this situation about or how it can be that
God holds us accountable for what he ordains tO come t0 pass_
Here Scripture
is silent, and we have t0 agree with Berkhof that ultimately "the problem of
God'$ relation t0 sin remains
mystery:
9.Are We "Free"
Do We Have "Free Will"? [f God exercises providential
control over all events are we in any sense free? The answer depends on what
is meant by the word free. In some senses of the word free; everyone agrees
that we are free in OUr will and in Our choices Even prominent
theologians in
the Reformed or' Calvinistic tradition concur: Both Louis Berkhof in his
Systematic Theology (pp. 103, 173) and John Calvin in his Institutes of the
Christian Religion

Therefore, Calvin concludes:
Man will then be spoken of as having this sort of free decision, not
because he has free choice equally of
and evil, but because he
acts wickedly by will, not by compulsion. Well put; indeed, but what
purpose is served by labeling with
proud name such
slight thing?
Calvin continues by explaining how this term is easily misunderstood:
But how few men are there;

insist that we have the power of willing choice;

On the other hand, the kind of freedom that is demanded by those
who deny God'$ providential control of all
freedom to be outside of
God'$
sustaining and controlling activity; would be impossible if Jesus Christ
is indeed
continually canrying along things by his word of power" (Heb: 1.3,

then to be outside of that providential
control would simply be not to exist! An absolute "freedom;

directed by God himself:

This third aspect of God $
providence indicates that God has
purpose
all that he does in the world
and he
providentially governs or directs all
in order that they
accomplish his purposes. We read in the Psalms _
~His kingdom rules over all"
(Ps. 103.19). Moreover; "he does according to his will in the host of heaven
and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand O say t0
him,
What are you doing?
(Dan. 4.35). Paul affirms that
from him and
through him and to him are all things" (Rom: 11.36) , and that "God has put
all things in subjection under his feet"
Cor: 15.27). God is the one who
accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will" (Eph: 1:11), so
that ultimately
at the name of Jesus'
every knee will bow "in heaven and on
earth and under the earth; and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
the glory of God the Father" (Phil. 2.10-11). It is because Paul knows that
God is
over all and works his purposes in every event that happens
that he can declare that
God causes all
[0 work
together for good to
those who love God, to those who are called
according to his purpose
(Rom:
8.28 NASB)
2. Distinctions
Concerning the Will of God: Though in God his will is
unified_
and not divided or contradictory; we cannot begin to understand the
depths of God's will, and only in
small part is it revealed t0 us. For this
reason, aS we Saw in
chapter 13,
two aspects of God $ will appear to uS_
the one hand, there is God' $ moral will (sometimes called his "revealed"
will) This includes the moral standards of Scripture, such as the Ten
Commandments and the moral
commands of the New Testament God' s
moral commands are given as descriptions of how we should conduct
ourselves if we would act rightly before him. On the other hand, another
aspect of God's will
his providential government of all
(sometimes
called his
secrer will"
This includes all the events of history that God has
ordained
come about; for example; the fact that Christ would be crucified
by "lawless men" (Acts 2.23). It also includes all the other evil acts that were
mentioned in the
preceding section.
Some have objected t0 this distinction between tWo aspects of the will of
God, arguing that
means there is
self-contradiction'
in God:
However;
even in the realm of human experience,
we know that we can will and carry
out something that is painful and that we do not desire (such as punishing
disobedient child or
getting an inoculation that temporarily makes us ill) in
order t0
bring about
term result that we desire more than the avoidance
short-term pain (to bring about the obedience of the child, for example, or
prevent us from getting

long-
greater and wiser than we are. Certainly it is possible for him t0 will that his
creatures do
something that in the short term displeases him in order that in
the long term he would receive the greater glory: To say that this is
"self-
contradiction
in God is t0 fail to understand the distinctions that have been
made s0 that this explanation is not contradictory:
The DtT

The decrees of God are the eternal plans of God whereby; before the creation
of the world, he determined to bring about everything that happens This
doctrine is similar to the doctrine of providence, but here we are thinking
about God s decisions before the world was created, rather than his
providential actions in time:
His providential
actions are the outworking of
the eternal
decrees that he made
ag0. (See chaprer 2, for

somewhat different sense
David confesses
"in your book were written_
every one of them_
that
formed for me
when as yet there was none of them" (Ps. 139.16; cf. Job
14.5: the
months
and bounds of man are determined by God) There
was also
definite plan and foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2.23) by which
Jesus was puL
death; and the actions of those who condemned and cnucified
him were ""predestined" (Acts 4.28) by God.
Our salvation was determined
ag0 because God
chose US in him (Christ) before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Eph: 1.4). Our
works as believers are those
which God prepared beforehand, that we
should walk in them"
(Eph: 2.10; cf: Jude 4).
These examples take in many diverse aspects of human activity. It seems
appropriate
conclude from these examples that all that God does he has
planned before the creation of the world
these
have been an
eternal plan with him. The benefic of an emphasis on God $ decrees is that it
helps us to realize that God does not make up plans suddenly as he goes
along
He knows the end
the beginning
and he will accomplish all his
good purposes.
This should greatly increase our trust in him, especially in
difficult circumstances.

We may sometimes forget that God works through human actions in his

To guard against any misunderstanding

Were

facl,

from
OM
of God*s providence we make the following points of emphasis_
1. We Are Still Responsible for Our Actions
God has made uS responsible
for OuI actions
which have real and eternally significant results: In all his
providential acts God will preserve these characteristics of responsibility and
significance.
Some analogies from the natural world might help us understand this God
has created
rock with the characteristic of
hard, and s0 it is_
God has
crealed water
the characteristic of being wet; and s0 it is. God has
created plants and animals with the characteristic of
alive , and s0
are: Similarly; God has created us with the characteristic of being responsible
for our actions, and S0 we arel If we d right and obey God, he
reward uS
and things
g0 well with us both in this age and in eternity: If we do wrong
and disobey God, he will discipline and perhaps punish uS_
and
will g0
ill with us.
The realization of these facts will help us have pastoral wisdom in
talking
others and in encouraging them to avoid laziness and disobedience_
The fact that we are
responsible for Our actions means that we should never
begin to think; "God made me do evil, and therefore
am not
responsible for
Significantly; Adam began t0 make excuses for the
tirst sin in terms
that sounded suspiciously like this: " The woman whom You gave tO be with
me, she gave me fruit of the tree;
and
Gen: 3.12).
Unlike Adam;
Scripture never blames God for sin. If we ever begin to think that God
blame fOL sin
we have thought wrongly about God
providence; tOr it
always the creature, not God who is to be blamed_
Now we may object that
is not right for God to hold us responsible if he has in fact ordained all
that happen_
but Paul corrects uS:
You will say t0 me then,
Why does he
find fault? For who can resist his will?
But who are You,
man, t0 answer
back to God?" (Rom: 9.19-20). We must realize and settle in our hearts that it
is right for God to rebuke and discipline and punish evil.
And; when we are
responsible t0 do s0
it is right for 4S t0 rebuke and discipline evil in our
families_
in the church; and even, in some ways_
in the society around us_
We
should never say about an evil event; "God willed it and therefore it is
because we must recognize that some things that God's will of decree has
planned are not in themselves
good, and should not receive our approval, just
as they do not receive God'$ approval.
2. Our Actions Have Real Results and Do Change the Course of Events:
In the ordinary
of the world, if
neglect

have poor eating habits, or if
abuse my body through alcohol 0r tobacco,

God has ordained that events will come about by our causing them. Of course,
we do not know what God has planned even for the rest of this
t0 say
nothing of next week Or next year: But we do know that if we trust God and
him;
will discover that he has planned good
[0 come about
through that obedience=
We cannot simply disregard others whom we meet;
for God brings many people across Our paths and gives Us the responsibility t0
act toward them in eternally significant ways
whether for good or ilL.
Calvin wisely notes that
encourage 4S [0 use
ordinary caution in life and
plan ahead,
God is pleased to hide all future events from 4S, in order that
should resist them as doubtful; and not cease tO oppose them with ready
remedies, until they are either overcome Or pass beyond all care.
God'$
providence does not always meet US in its naked
but God in

clothes it with the means employed:
By contrast; if we anticipate that some dangers Or evil events may come in the
future_
and if we do not use reasonable means
avoid them; then we may in
fact discover that our lack of action was the means that God used t0 allow
them t0 come about!

beyond remedies But what if the dangers are not fatal, because the
Lord has provided YOu with remedies for repulsing and overcoming
them?
One good example of vigorous activity combined with trust in God is found
in 2 Samuel 10.12, where Joab says,
Be strong and let us show ourselves
courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God,

adds immediately in the same sentence_

(NASB) Joab

Similar examples are found in the New Testament When Paul was in Corinth;

(Acts 18.9-10). If Paul had been
fatalist with an improper
understanding of God*s providence;
he would have listened t0 God $ words,

and concluded that God had determined t0

and that therefore
did not matter Whether
Paul stayed there or not: God had already chosen many people

Paul would have thought that he may as well pack his bags and leavel But
Paul does not make that mistake. He rather concludes that if God has chosen
many people, then it will probably be through the means of Paul's preaching
the
gospel that those many people would be saved
Therefore Paul makes
wise decision: "And he stayed
year and six months, teaching the word of
God among them
(Acts 18.11).
Paul put this kind of responsible action in the light of God'$ providence into
single sentence in
Timothy 210, where he said_
endure everything for the
sake of the elect; that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its
eternal glory:'
He did not argue from the fact that God had chosen some to be
saved that nothing had to be done; rather; he concluded that much had to be
done in order that God $ purposes might come about by the means that God

A related example is found in the
of Paul $ joumey tO Rome. God had
clearly revealed to Paul that no one on the ship would die from the long storm
had endured. Indeed, Paul stood before the passengers and crew and told
them t0 take heart,
for there will be no loss of life among YOu; but only of the ship_

Rather; he

Paul said t0 the centurion and the soldiers,

Wisely; Paul knew that God $ providential oversight and even his clear
prediction of what would happen still involved the use of ordinary human
means [0
about: He was even s0 bold to say that those means were
necessary: "Unless these men stay in the ship, You cannot be saved" (Acts
27.31).
We would do well to imitate his example, combining complete trust in
God'$ providence with
realization that the use of ordinary means is
necessary for
to come out the way God has planned them to come out:
What If We Cannot Understand This Doctrine Fully? Every believer
who meditates on God's providence will sooner or later come t0
point where
he or she will have t0 say;
cannot understand this doctrine fully: '
In some
ways that must be said about every doctrine, since our
'understanding is finite,
and God is infinite (see chapter 1).
But particularly is this s0 with the doctrine
of providence:
should believe it because Scripture teaches
even when
we do not understand fully how it fits in with other
teachings of Scripture:

Although
have already begun to speak of the practical application of this
doctrine, three additional points should be made_
Do Not Be Afraid

major alternative position held by many
evangelicals_
which fOr
convenience we shall call the
Arminian'
view:
Among denominations in
contemporary
evangelicalism; Methodists and Nazarenes tend to be
thoroughly Arminian, whereas Presbyterians and the Christian Reformed tend
to be thoroughly Reformed (at least by denominational
statement of faith).
Both views are found among Baptists, Episcopalians (though the Thirty-Nine
Articles have
clearly Reformed emphasis) , Dispensationalists, Evangelical
Free Churches, Lutherans (though Martin Luther was in the Reformed camp
on this issue) , the Churches of Christ; and most charismatic and Pentecostal
groups (though Pentecostal
denominations such as the Assemblies of God
have been predominantly Arminian).
Those who hold an Arminian position maintain that in order [0 preserve the
real human freedom and real human choices that are necessary for genuine
human personhood, God cannot cause 0r plan our voluntary choices
Therefore
conclude that God $ providential involvement in Or control of
history must not include every specific detail of
event that happens
but
that God instead simply responds t0 human choices and actions as they come
about and does s0 in such
way that his purposes are ultimately accomplished
in the world:
Those who hold this position argue that God'$ purposes in the

Cottrell says,

that God achieves his overall

choices of human beings
whatever they may be_
Pinnock says that
predestination does not apply tO every individual activity; but is rather the
comprehensive purpose of God which is the structural context in which
history moves
Moreover; advocates of the Arminian position maintain that God'$ will cannot

clearly affirms, "It is not true that everything that happens is
what God desires.
These statements make
clear that the differences
between the Reformed and Arminian positions are not merely differences in
terminology: there is
real
disagreement in substance.
Several
arguments are
advanced in defense of the Arminian position:
have attempted to summarize
them in the four major points that follow:

That God Ordinarily Works in
Human Activity. In surveying the Old Testament passages referring

2. The Calvinist View Wrongly Makes God Responsible for Sin: Those
who hold an Arminian position ask;
How can God be holy if he decrees that
we sin?" They affirm that God
noc the
author of sin;"
that
God cannot be
tempted with
and he himself tempts no one'
(James 1.13), that
light and in him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1.5), and that "the LORD is
upright
and there
no unrighteousness in him
(Ps. 92.15).
The view of God's providence advocated above
they
say; makes US
into puppets Or robots who cannot do anything other than what God causes uS
But this brings moral reproach on God;
for Marshall says,; "[am
responsible for what my agent does_
Pinnock affirms that "it is simply
blasphemous t0 maintain; as this theory does, that man'
rebellion against
God is in any sense the
product of God's sovereign will or primary
causation:
Choices Caused by God Cannot Be Real Choices_
When the Calvinist
claims that God causes US t0 choose
voluntarily, those who hold an
Arminian position would respond that any choices that are ultimately caused
by God cannot be real choices; and that; if God really causes us t0 make the
choices
make_
then we are not real persons_
Cottrell says that the Calvinist
view of God as the primary cause and men as
econdary causes really breaks
down SO there is only one cause, God_
man uses
lever t0 move
rock, he
argues;
the lever is not
true second cause but is only an instrument of the
real cause of the movement
In my judgment the concept of cause has no
real significance when used in this sense. In such
system man contributes
only what has been predetermined.
Pinnock writes:
Personal fellowship of the kind envisioned in the Gospel only exists
where consummated in
free decision. If we wish to understand
God
grace as personal
address t0 his creatures;
must comprehend
it in dynamic; non-manipulative_
non-coercive terms; aS the Bible
does.
He also says:

"God

decision of man $ would have any effect; that basic intuition of man'$
that he is an actor and
free agent would be nonsensical: There
would then be no point to his
plans 0r exerting efforts
intended t0 transform the world:
Human freedom is the
precondition of moral and intellectual responsibility:
Why then, in the Arminian view; did the fall and sin come about? Pinnock
answers that "they occur because God refuses t0 mechanize man 0r t0 force
his will upon him:
And Marshall says, with respect t0 the
possibility of
my
predetermining
course of action involving myself and another subject;
that
on the level of free agents it is impossible
He objects that the
analogy of God and world as
like an author and
play is unhelpful
because if we ask whether the characters are indeed free, "this is an unreal
question_
However;
should be noted that Arminian theologians are certainly willing
allow some kinds
influence by God on human beings. Marshall says
"Prayer also influences men.
The wills of men can thus be affected by
prayer Or else we would not pray for them. To believe in prayer is thus t0
believe in some kind of limitation of human freedom, and in some kind of
incomprehensible influence upon the wills of men.
To drive home their point about the essential freedom of the human will,
advocates of an Arminian position draw attention tO the frequency of the free
offer of the gospel in the New Testament They would say that these
invitations t0 people tO repent and come to Christ for salvation, if bona fide
must imply the ability t0 respond tO them: Thus, all people without exception
have the ability t0 respond_
not just those who have been sovereignly given
that ability by God in
special way:
In further support of this point;
Arminians would see
Corinthians 10.13 as
clearly affirming
ability not to sin. Paul says to the Corinthians_
No
temptation has overtaken You that is not common t0 man. God is faithful, and
he will not let You be tempted beyond your strength; but with the temptation
will also provide the way of escape_
that VOu may be able t0 endure i
But, it
is said,
this statement would be false if God sometimes ordains that we sin,
for then we would not be
able"
t0 escape from tempration without sinning:

the Calvinistic View Encourages
Dangerous Fatalism Christians who
hold an Arminian position argue that the Calvinist view; when thoroughly
understood, destroys motives for responsible Christian behavior: Randall
Basinger says that the Calvinist view
establishes that what is
ought to be and
rules out the consideration that things could andlor should have been
different
Basinger continues by saying that Christians
who evoke and act on the basis of God' s sovereignty are guilty of an
arbitrary; unlivable
and dangerous fatalism
In contrast t0 this_
Arminian believes that what actually occurs in the world is_
t0 an
extent; consequent on the human will; God's exhaustive control over
the world is denied
means that things can occur that God does
not will 0r want;
not only can be different but often should be
different:
And from all this follows our responsibility t0 work with

However; Basinger goes On t0 make
further point: Calvinists, in practice_
often avoid such fatalism and "live and talk like Arminians_
Thus

one hand
Basinger's challenge
warning against the practical extremes
which he claims Calvinism should logically drive Christians On the other
hand, his objection claims that when Calvinists live the way

must live, in responsible obedience t0 God, they are either inconsistent with
their view of divine sovereignty Or else not
allowing their view of God's
sovereign control to affect their daily lives_
REpone

Many
evangelical world will find these four Arminian arguments
convincing:
will feel
that these arguments represent what
intuitively know about themselves, their own actions, and the way the
functions, and that these arguments best account for the repeated emphasis in
Scripture on OuI responsibility and the real consequences of our choices
However; there are some answers that can be given t0 the Arminian position.
1. Are These Scripture Passages Unusual Examples_
or Do They Describe
the Way God Works Ordinarily? In response t0 the objection that the
examples of God'$ providential control only refer to limited or specific
events _
it may be said first that the examples are s0 numerous (see the
beginning of chapter 16) that they seem t0 be designed [0 describe [0 US the
ways in which God works all the time_
God does not just cause some grass to
grow; he causes all grass t0 grow: He does not just send some rain; he sends

He does not just know every word on David's tongue before he speaks it;
he knows the words on all our tongues before we speak them. He has not just
chosen Paul and the Christians in the Ephesian churches
be holy and
blameless before him; he has chosen all Christians t0 be holy and blameless
before him_
This
why Cottrell '$ claim, that God was working differently in
Australia and South America than in the Old Testament;
is SO unconvincing:
Scripture is given t0 tell u4s the ways of God
and when we have dozens of
examples throughout Old and New Testaments where there is such clear
on this, it is appropriate for US tO conclude that this is the way in
which God always works with human beings_
By contrast; there seems t0 be
in Scripture that would indicate that some
are outside God s
providentia_
control, or that these ways of God $
are unusual or
unrepresentative of the ways in which he acts generally:
Moreover; many of the verses that speak of God' $ providence are very
general: Christ
continually carries along all things by his word of power"
(Heb
13_
author
translation) , and "in him all things hold together" (Col.
1.17)_
"In him we live and move and have our being
(Acts 17.28). He
accomplishes all
according to the counsel of his will" (Eph: 1:11).
He provides our food (Matt: 6.11), supplies all our needs (Phil. 4.19) , directs
steps (Prov 20.24) and works in uS
will and t0 do his
pleasure
(Phil. 2:13). Such Scripture passages have in view more than exceptional
examples of an unusual intervention by God in the affairs of human beings;
they describe the way God always works in the world.
Does the Calvinistic Doctrine of God s Providence Make God
Responsible for Sin? Against the Calvinistic view of God'$ providence
(which allows that he decrees t0 permit sin and evil) Arminians would say
that God is nOr
responsible for sin and evil because he did not ordain them or
cause them in any way This is indeed one way of
absolving God from
responsibility and blame for sin, but is it the biblical
way?
The problem is whether the Arminian position can really account for many
texts thar clearly say that God ordains that some people sin 0r do evil (see
Section B.
in chapter 16). The death of Christ is the prime example of this,
but there are many Others in Scripture (Joseph's brothers, Pharaoh, the
Egyptians, the Canaanites
Eli 's sons,
David $ census, and the Babylonians_
mention
few) The response could be made that these were unusua

for; on the Arminian view; how can God be holy if he ordains even one sinful

The Calvinist position seems preferable: God himself never sins but always
about his will through secondary causes; that is, through personal

While the Arminian position objects that; on

Rather; Scripture
repeatedly gives examples where God in
mysterious_
hidden way somehow
ordains that people do wrong; but continually places the blame for that wrong
on the individual human who does wrOng and never on God himself: The
Arminian position seems t0 have failed t0 show why God cannot work in this
way in the world, preserving both his holiness and Our individual
human
responsibility for sin:
Can Choices Ordained by God Be Real Choices? In response to the
claim that choices ordained by God cannot be real choices, it must be said that
this is simply an assumption based once again on human experience and
intuition_
nOr 0n
specific texts of Scripture
Yet Scripture does not indicate
that we can
extrapolate from our human experience when
with God $
providential control of his creatures, especially human
Arminians
have simply not answered the question, Where does Scripture say that
choice ordained by God is not
real choice?
When we read passages
indicating that God works through our
OuI power t0 choose, and our
personal volition, on what basis can we say that
choice brought about by
God through these means is not
real choice?
seems better t0 affirm thar
God says that our choices are real and t0 conclude that therefore they are real
Scripture repeatedly affirms that our choices are genuine choices_
that they
have real results
and that those results last for eternity:
Do this
and you will
live'
(Luke 10.28).
For God s0 loved the world that he gave his only
that whoever believes
him should not perish but have eternal life" (John
3.16).
This causes US t0 conclude that God has made uS in such
way that (1) he
ordains all that we do, and
we exercise our' personal will and make real,
voluntary choices.
Because we cannot understand this should we therefore
reject it? We cannot understand (in any final sense_

true either because we see that plants in fact do live and bumblebees in fact do

Calvin several times distinguishes between

with
regard to Our will: unbelievers necessarily sin, but no compulsion forces
them
sin against their will_
In response
the objection that an act cannot
voluntary if it is
necessary act; Calvin points
both the
deeds of God (who necessarily does good) and the evil deeds of the Devil
(who necessarily does evil):
If the fact that he must do
does not hinder God $ free will in
doing good; if the Devil, who can only do evil, yet sins with his will

what basis can we prove that? God in Scripture tells us that he ordains all that

He also tells us that our choices and actions are significant in

We need
simply to believe these things and tO take comfort in them: After all, he alone

But do Our actions have any effect on God? At this point Arminians will
object that while Calvinists may say that

because _

nothing that God does can ever be

decrees were not influenced by any of 0ur actions and
cannot be changed by US, since they were made before creation.
But t0
conclude from that that Calvinists think God does not react in time t0
anything we do_
not influenced by
anything
we do, is simply false
No
Calvinist theologian known to me has ever said that God is not influenced by
what we do or does nOt react [0 what we do
He is grieved at our sin. He
delights in our praise. He answers OUr prayers.
To say that God does not react

actions is [0
the whole history of the Bible from Genesis t0
Revelation:
Now
Calvinist would add that God has eternally decreed that he would
respond t0 Us as he does. In
he has decreed that we would act as we do
and he would respond t0 our actions. But his responses are still genuine
responses
his answers tO prayers are still genuine answers tO prayer; his
delight in

still genuine delight: Cottrell may of course object that
response that God has planned

but this is far

we retum [0 the same

objection: on what scriptura)

Here it is helpful for US to realize that there is no other reality in the universe

we have absolutely no sense of being forced or compelled to choose one thing
rather than another:
Now some may object that this view makes us mere "puppets"
robots
But we are not puppets Or robots; we are real persons:
Puppets and robots do
not have the power of personal choice 0r even individual thought: We; by
contrast, think, decide, and choose. Again the Arminian wrongly takes
information from our situation as human beings and then uses that
deny
fact,

Then

information to place limitations on what God can or cannot do_
AIl of these
analogies from human experience fail tO recognize that God is far greater than
our limited human abilities. Moreover; we are far more real and complex than
any robot Or puppet would ever be
~we are real persons created by an
infinitely powerful and infinitely wise God
Much of our difficulty in understanding how God can cause US t0 choose
something willingly
comes from the finite nature of Our creaturely existence_
hypothetical world where all living things created by God were plants
rooted in the ground
we might imagine one plant arguing t0 another that God
could not make
creatures who could move about on the earth; for how
could
cany their roots with them? And if their roots were not in the
ground_
how could they receive nourishment? An
Arminian" plant might
even argue_
"In order for God t0 create
world with living things, he had to
create them with roots and with the characteristic of
all their lives in a
single place: To say that God could not create living things that move about
on the earth does not
challenge God's omnipotence_
tOr that is simply
say
that he cannot do
that logically cannot be done:
Therefore it is
impossible that God could create
world where
also have the
capacity of moving about on the earth_
The problem with this plant is that it
has limited God '$ pOwer by virtue of its Own "plant-like
experience.
On
higher level, we could imagine
creation that had both plants and
animals but no human beings_
In that creation; we can imagine an argument
between
Calvinist"
and
"Arminian'
dog_
where the "Calvinist"
would argue that
is possible for God t0 create creatures that not only can
communicate by barking t0 one another but also can record their barks in
marks 0n paper and can send them silently t0 be understood by Other creatures
many days' joumey distant; creatures who have never been seen by the
sending creature who first marked his barks down on paper: The
Arminian"
dog would reply that God cannot do such
thing; because essential to the
idea of creaturely communication is hearing and seeing (and usually
smelling !) the creature from whom one receives the communication: To say
that there can be communication without ever hearing or seeing or
smelling
the other creature is an absurd ideaz
It is beyond the range of possible
occurrences and is logically inconceivable.
Therefore it is impossible to think
that God could create
creature with such communicating abilities
In both cases the
Arminian" plant and the
Arminian" dog are in the wrong;
because they have incorrectly limited the kind of thing God could create by
what was possible for God (in their opinion) from their own finite
creaturely existence. But this is
similar to the Arminian theologian who

simply asserts (on the basis of his own perception of human experience,
that
God cannor creale
creature who makes
willing; voluntary; meaningful
choices_
and that those choices are nonetheless ordained by God. Similarly;
the Arminian theologian who argues that God cannot ordain that evil come
about and not yet himself be responsible for evil,
God based
merely on observation of finite human experience_
Does
Calvinistic View of Providence Encourage Either
Dangerous
Fatalism 0r _
Tendency to "Live Like Arminians" ? The view of
providence presented above emphasizes the need for responsible obedience
so it is not correct tO say that it encourages the kind of fatalism that says that
whatever is, should be_
Those who accuse Reformed writers of believing this
have simply not understood the Reformed doctrine of providence.
But d Calvinists "live like Arminians'
anyway? Both Calvinists and
Arminians believe that our actions have real results and that
are etemally
significant: Both agree that we are responsible for our actions and that we
make
voluntary;
choices.
Both groups will agree that God answers
prayer; that proclaiming the gospel results in people being saved, and that
obedience
God results in blessing
life, while disobedience results in lack
of God*s blessing_
But the differences are very significant Calvinists when true to their doctrine
will live with
far more
comprehensive tNuSt
God in all circumstances and
far greater freedom from WOny about the future; because they are
convinced, not just that God will somehow cause his major purposes

but that all
work

love God and

Additional Objections to the Arminian Position: In addition to
responding to the four specific Arminian claims mentioned above some
remaining objections t0 it need to be considered
On an Arminian View; How Can God Know the Future?: According t0
the Arminian view; our human choices are not caused by God. They are
torally free. But Scripture gives many examples of God predicting the future
and of prophecies being fulfilled exactly. How can God predict the future in
this way if it is not certain what will happen?
In response to this question, Arminians give three different kinds of answer:
Some say that God is not able to know details about the future; specifically;
they deny that God is able t0 know what choices individual human beings will
make in the future.
This seems [0 me [0 be the most consistent Arminian
position, but the result is that, while God may be able t0 make some fairly
accurate predictions based on complete knowledge of the present; these
cannot be certain predictions. Ultimately it also means that God is ignorant of
all future human choices_
which means that he does nOr even know what the
stock market will do tomorow;
who will be elected as the next president of
the United States_
0r who will be converted On this view, what event of
human history could God know with certainty in advance? No event
This is
radical revision of the idea of omniscience and seems
be clearly denied by
the dozens 0f examples of
unfailing predictive prophecy in Scripture, the
fulfillment of which demonstrates that God is the true God in opposition to
false
Other Arminians simply affirm that God knows everything that
happen;
but this does not mean that he has planned or caused what will happen
simply means that he has the ability
see into the future_
(The phrase
sometimes used
express this view is "Foreknowledge does not imply
foreordination.
This is probably the most common Arminian view, and
ably expressed by Jack Cottrell:
affirm that God has
tnue foreknowledge
of future free-will choices without himself being the
that causes them or
renders them certain:
The problem with this position is that;
evem
if God did not plan or cause
things to happen, the fact that they are foreknown means that they will
certainly come about And this means that our decisions are predetermined by
something (whether fate Or the inevitable cause-and-effect mechanism of the
universe), and they still are not free in the sense the Arminian wishes them to
be free: If our future choices are known; then they are fixed_
And if
are
gods.
will
agent
they
fixed, then
are nL
free'
in the Arminian sense (undetermined 0r
uncaused):
third Arminian response is called "middle knowledge.
Those who take this
view would say that the future choices of people are not determined by God_
but that God knows them anyway; because he knows all future possibilities,
and he knows how each free creature will respond in any set of circumstances
that might occur:
William Craig says:
God's insight into the will of
tree creature is 0f such
surpassing
quality that God knows exactly what the free creature would do were
God to place him in
certain set of circumstances
By knowing
what every
possible free creature would do in any possible situation,
God can by
bringing about that situation know what the creature will
freely do.
Thus he foreknows with certainty everything that
happens in the world
But Craig
view does not sustain
view of freedom in the sense Arminians
usually maintain: that no cause 0r set of causes made
person choose the way
he or she did.
On Craig $ view; the surrounding circumstances and the
person $ Own disposition guarantee that.
certain choice will be made
otherwise
God could not know what the choice would be from his exhaustive
knowledge of the person and the circumstances
But if God knows what the
choice will be
and if that choice
guaranteed, then it could not be otherwise:
Moreover; if both the person and the circumstances have been created by
God
then ultimately the outcome has been determined by God. This sounds
close [0 freedom in
Calvinist sense_
but it is certainly not the kind of
freedom that most Arminians would accept:
b. On an Arminian View; How Can Evil Exist If God Did Not Want It?:
Arminians quite clearly say that the entrance of evil into the world was not
according
[0 the will of God_
Pinnock says, "The fall of man is an eloquent
refutation to the theory that God'$ will is always done.
But how can evil
exist
God did not want it t0 exist? If evil happens in spite of the fact that
God does not want
happen, this seems t0 deny God $ omnipotence: he
wanted
prevent evil, but he
unable t0 do s0_
How then can
believe
that this God is omnipotent?
The common Arminian response is tO say that God was able t0 prevent evil
but he chose
allow for the possibility of evil
order to guarantee that
angels and humans would have the freedom necessary fOr meaningful
they
very
choices. In other words;
God had to allow for the possibility of sinful choices
in order to allow genuine human choices. Cottrell says, " This
God-given
freedom includes human freedom to rebel and tO sin against the Creator
himself. By creating
world in which sin was possible; God thereby bound
himself to react in certain specific ways should sin become
reality.
But this is nOr
satisfactory response either; for it implies that God will have
allow for the possibility of sinful choices in heaven eternally. On the
Arminian position; if any of our choices and actions in heaven are t0 be
genuine and real, then
will have t0 include the possibility of sinful
choices. But this implies that even in heaven, for all eternity; we Will face the
real possibility of choosing evil
-and therefore the possibility of rebelling
against God and losing our salvation and being cast out of heaven! This is
terrifying thought; but
seems
necessary implication of the Arminian view:
Yet there
implication that is more
troubling: If
choices have t0 allow
for the possibility of choosing evil, then
God $ choices are nOL real, since
he cannot choose evil, or (2) God $ choices are real, and there is the genuine
possibility that God might someday choose to do evil
perhaps
little, and
perhaps
great deal. If we ponder the second implication it becomes
terrifying But it is contrary t0 the abundant testimony of Scripture:
On the
other hand
the first implication is clearly false: God is the definition of what
is real, and it is clearly an error tO say that his choices are not real. Both
implications therefore provide good reason for rejecting the Arminian
position that real choices must allow the possibility of choosing evil. But this
usS back t0 the earlier question for Which there does nOr seem [0 be
satisfactory answer from the Arminian position: How can evil exist if God did
not want it [0 exist?
On an Arminian View, How
We Know That God Will Triumph
Over Evil?: If we go back t0 the Arminian assertion that evil is not
according
to the will of God, another problem arises: if all the evil now in the world
came into the
even though God did not want it, how can we be sure that
God will triumph over it in the end? Of course; God says in Scripture that he
will triumph over evil.
But if he was unable [0
it out of his universe in
the first place and it came in against his will, and if he is unable t0 predict the
outcome of any future events that involve free choices by human, angelic; and
demonic agents; how then can we be sure that God $ declaration that he will
triumph over all evil is in itself tnue? Perhaps this
just
hopeful prediction
of something that (on the Arminian viewpoint) God simply cannot know: Far
from the
incredible freedom from wOry about the future" which the

Calvinist has because he knows that an omnipotent God makes
work together for
(Rom: 8.28 KJV); the Arminian position seems
logically
drive US [0
deep-seated anxiety about the ultimate outcome of
history:
Both of these last two objections regarding evil make uS realize that, while we
may have difficulties in
thinking about the Reformed view of evil as ordained
by God and completely under the control of God_
there are far more serious
difficulties with the Arminian view of evil as not ordained 0r even willed by
God
and therefore not assuredly under the control of God
d. The Difference in the Unanswered Questions: Since we are finite in OuI
understanding;
inevitably will have some unanswered questions abour
every biblica)
doctrine. Yet on this issue the questions that Calvinists and
Arminians MUSC
leave unanswered are
different: On the one hand,
Calvinists must say that
do not know the answer t0 the following
questions:
Exactly how God can ordain that we do evil willingly; and yet
God not be blamed for evil.
Exactly how God can cause US
choose something willingly:
To both, Calvinists would say that the answer is somehow to be found in an
d Yaremess
God*s infinite greatness_
in the knowledge of the fact that he can
do far more than we could ever think possible. So the effect of these
unanswered questions is t0 increase our appreciation of the greatness of God_
On the other hand,
Arminians muSt leave unanswered questions regarding
God'$ knowledge of the future
why he would allow evil when
is against his
will, and whether he will certainly triumph over evil: Their failure tO resolve
these questions tends to diminish the greatness of God
his omniscience, his
omnipotence_
and the absolute reliability of his promises for the future: And
these unanswered questions tend to exalt the greatness of man (his freedom t0
do what God does not want) and the power of evil (it comes and remains in
the universe even though God does not want it) Moreover; by denying that
God can make creatures who have real choices that are nevertheless caused
by him, the Arminian position diminishes the wisdom and skill of God the
Creator:

Miracles
What are miracles? Can they happen today?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
consideration of the subject of miracles
closely connected with God'$
providence, which was considered
the previous chapter: There we argued
that God exercises an extensive, ongoing; sovereign control over all aspects of
his creation
This chapter will assume an understanding of that discussion of
providence and will build on
in approaching the question of miracles
clninanl
We may define
miracle as follows:
miracle
less common kind of God 5
activity in which he arouses people
Ove
and wonder and bears witness 0
himself
This definition takes into account OUr previous understanding of
God'$ providence whereby God preserves, controls_
and governs all
we understand providence in this way; we Will naturally avoid some other
common explanations 0r definitions of miracles
For example_
one definition of miracle is
direct intervention of God in the
world:
But this definition assumes
deistic view of God's relationship to the
world, in which the world continues on its Own and God only intervenes in it
occasionally. This
certainly not the biblical view;
according-
which God
makes the rain to fall (Matt: 5.45), causes the grass
grow (Ps. 104.14), and
continually carries along all things by his word of power (Heb. 1.3).
Another
detinition of miracle is
more direct activity of God in the world
But [0
talk about
more direct"
of God suggests that his ordinary
providential activity is somehow nOr
direct" and
hints
SOIE of
deistic removal of God from the world
Another definition is
God
in the world without using means tO
about the results he wishes
Yet to speak of God
without means
leaves us with very few if any miracles in the Bible, for it is hard tO think of
miracle that came about with no means at all: in the
of people_
for
things.
working
again_
working
bring
working
healing'
example
some of the physical properties of the sick person $ body were
doubtless involved as part of the healing: When Jesus multiplied the loaves
and fishes, he at least used the original five loaves and two fishes that were
there_
When he
changed water t0 wine_
he used water and made it become
wine. This definition seems t0 be inadequate_
Yer another definition of miracle is
an exception to
natural law
God
acting contrary [0 the laws of nature.
But the phrase "laws of nature
popular understanding implies that there are certain qualities inherent in the
things that exist; "laws of nature
that operate independently of God_
and that
God must intervene or "break" these laws for
miracle [0 occur:
Once again
this definition does not adequately account for the biblical teaching on
providence_
Another definition of miracle is
an event impossible tO explain by natural
causes:
This definition is inadequate because ( 1) it does not include God as
the one who
brings about the miracle;
assumes that God does not use
some natural
causes when he works in an unusual or amazing way; and thus it
assumes
that God only occasionally intervenes in the world; and (3) it
will result in
significant minimizing of actual
miracles and an increase in
skepticism, since many times when God works in answer t0 prayer the result
is amazing t0 those who prayed but it is not
absolutely impossible to explain
by natural
causes, especially for
skeptic who simply refuses t0 see God $
hand at work
Therefore_
the original definition given above
where
miracle is simply
less common way of God's working in the world, seems to be preferable and
more consistent with the biblical doctrine of God $ providence.
This
definition does not say that
miracle is
different kind of working by God,
but only that_
less
common way of God $ working and that
is done SO
as t0 arouse people'$
surprise_
awe; Or amazement in such
way that God
bears witness t0 himself.
The biblical terminology for miracles frequently points to this idea of God's
power at work to arouse people's wonder and amazement: Primarily three sets
of terms are employed:
'sign'
(Heb
oth; Gk semeion), which means
something that points to Or indicates something else, especially (with
reference t0 miracles) God's activity and power; (2)
'wonder" (Heb. mopeth;
Gk teras), an event that causes people to be amazed or astonished; and (3)
miracle" or "mighty work" (Heb
"biirah; Gk dynamis), an act displaying
great power; especially (with reference
miracles) divine power:
Often
again
signs and wonders
is used as
stock expression to refer t0 miracles (Ex:
7.3; Deut: 6.22; Ps. 135.9; Acts 4.30; 5.12_
Rom: 15.19; et al.), and
sometimes all three terms are combined; "mighty works and wonders and
signs
(Acts 2.22) or
signs and wonders and mighty works`
(2 Cor: 12.12;
Heb. 2.4).
In addition t0 the meanings of the terms used for miracles_
another reason
supporting our definition is the fact that miracles in Scripture do arouse
people
4we
and amazement and indicate that God $ power is at work: The
Bible frequently tells us that God himself is the one who performs
miracles'
wondrous
Psalm 136.4 says that God is the one "who alone does
great wonders
(cf. Ps. 72.18). The song of Moses declares:
Who is like you; 0 LORD, among the gods?
Who
like you, majestic in holiness_
terrible in glorious deeds, doing wonders? (Ex 15.11)
Thus
the miraculous signs that Moses did when his staff turned into
snake
and back again, 01 when his hand became leprous and then clean again (Ex:
4.2-8),
were given that Moses might demonstrate [0 the people of Israel that
God had sent him. Similarly; the miraculous signs God did by the hand of
Moses and Aaron through the plagues
far surpassing the false miracles or
imitation signs done by the magicians
Pharaoh
court (Ex 7.12; 8.18-19;
9.11) , showed that the people of Israel were those who worshiped the one true
God
When Elijah confronted the priests of Baal
on Mount Carmel ( 1
18.17-40) , the fire from heaven demonstrated that the LORD was the one true
God
Now if we accept the definition that
miracle
less common kind of
God's activity in which he arouses people'$ awe and wonder and bears
witness t0 himself;
then
may ask what kinds of things should be
considered miracles_
Of course
we are
right to consider the incarnation of
Jesus as God-man and Jesus"
resurrection from the dead as the central and
most important miracles in all history. The events of the exodus such as the
parting of the Red Sea and the fall of Jericho were remarkable miracles_
When Jesus healed people and cleansed lepers and cast out demons, those
were certainly miracles as well (see Matt 11:4-5; Luke 4.36-41; John 2.23;
4.54; 6.2; 20.30-31).
But can we consider unusual answers
prayer t0 be miracles? Apparently s0
if they are remarkable enough to arouse people
awe and wonder and cause
things.
Kings
them [0
acknowledge God"$ power at work: the answer to Elijah's prayer that
God would send fire from heaven was
miracle ( 1
18.24, 36-38) , as
were the answers to his prayers that the widow $ dead son would come back
to life (1
17.21), or that the rain would stop and later start again
17.1; 18.41-45 with James 5.17-18). In the New Testament; the release
of Peter
prison
answer 0 the prayers of the church was certainly
miracle (Acts 12.5-17; note also Paul'
prayer for Publius's father in Acts
28.8)
But there must have been many miracles not nearly as dramatic as
those _
because Jesus healed many hundreds of people,
thar were sick
with various diseases
(Luke 4.40).
Paul healed
rest of the people on the
island who had diseases
(Acts 28.9).
On the other hand, Christians see answers t0 prayer every day; and we should
not water down our definition of miracle s0 much that every answer tO prayer
is called
miracle_
But when an answel
prayer is SO remarkable that people
involved with it are amazed and acknowledge God's power at work in an
unusual way; then it seems appropriate t0 call it
miracle
This is consistent
with our definition and seems supported by the biblical evidence that works
of God that aroused people's awe and wonder were called miracles (Gk
dynamis)
But whether we adopt
broad 0r narTow definition of miracle, all should
agree that if God really does work in answer tO Our prayers; whether in
common or uncommon ways, it is important that we recognize this and give
thanks to him, and that we not ignore

In the New Testament, Jesus
miraculous signs attested that he had come from
God: Nicodemus
recognized
"No one can do these signs that you do_
unless
God is with him" (John 3.2). Jesus' changing of water into wine was
sign"
that "manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him" (John 2:11)
According
Peter; Jesus was
man attested
you by God with mighty
works and wonders and signs which God did through him in yOur midst"
(Acts 2.22).
Then in the early church
the apostles and others who preached the gospel
performed miracles that amazed people and

Even in churches where no apostles were present miracles occurred. For
example
Paul, in writing t0 several churches in the region of Galatia (see Gal:
1:1), assumes this when he asks; "Does he who supplies the Spirit tO yOu and
works miracles among You do 50 by works of the law; or by hearing with
faith?" (Gal. 3.5) . Similarly, he mentions
the church at Corinth "workers 0f
miracles" (1 Cor: 12.28) and names "the
of miracles'
(1 Cor: 12.10)
gift distributed by the Holy Spirit These last tWo verses are especially
significant because
Corinthians 12.4-31 is not discussing
specific
situation at Corinth but the nature of the church in genera
as the "body of
Christ" with many members yet one body.
In tact; it seems t0 be
characteristic of the New Testament church that
miracles occur:
In the Old Testament; miracles seemed t0 occur primarily in
connection with one prominent leader ar
time, such as Moses 0r Elijah or
Elisha:
In the New Testament, there is
sudden and unprecedented increase in
the miracles when Jesus begins his ministry (Luke 4.36-37
40-41).
However; contrary t0 the pattern of the Old Testament; the authority
work
miracles and t0 cast out demons was not confined t0 Jesus himself; nor did
miracles die out when Jesus returned t0 heaven:
Even during his ministry;
Jesus gave authority t0 heal
the sick and to cast out demons not only t0 the
'Twelve_
but also
seventy of his disciples (Luke 10.1,9, 17-19; cf. Matt
10.8; Luke 9.49-50)_
Moreover; the passages noted above from
Corinthians
and Galatians indicate that performing miracles was not confined t0 the
seventy disciples, but was characteristic of the churches of Galatia and the
New Testament churches generally. This suggests that the occurrence of
miracles is
characteristic of the New Testament church and may be seen as
an indication of the pOwerful new work of the Holy Spirit that began with
Pentecost and may be expected to continue through the church age.
MirdE
One purpose of miracles is certainly to authenticate the message of the gospel.
was evident in Jesus
Own
ministry; as people like Nicodemus
acknowledged: "We know that You are
teacher come from God; for no one
can do these signs that you do
unless God is with him" (John 3.2) It also was
evident as the gospeb
was proclaimed by those who heard Jesus_
tOr as they
preached; "God also bore witness by signs
wonders and various miracles
and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed
according -
to his own will" (Heb_
2.4). Whether this purpose
Was
valid only when the gospel was first preached
(before the
Testament was written) , Or whether it holds good throughout
being
working
This
ana
New
the church age, depends on what we think the miracles are
confirming: are
they
confirming only the absolute truthfulness of the words of Scripture (as
the very words of God); 0r are miracles given tO confirm the truthfulness of
the
gospel generally; whenever it is preached? In other words_
do miracles
confirm Scripture
the gospel? As we shall see below; miracles were not
limited t0 those who wrote Scripture 0r spoke with absolute apostolic
authority.
This suggests that miracles given in confirmation of the gospel
might be expected
continue throughout the church age.
When miracles occur;
give evidence that God is truly at work and s0
serve [0 advance the
gospel: the Samaritan woman proclaimed to her village;
"Come_
see
man who told me all that
evei
did" (John 4.29), and many of
the Samaritans believed in Christ:
was frequently true in Jesus ' ministry,
but it was also true in the early church: when Philip went to
city in Samaria,
the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip,
when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. For unclean
spirits came out of many who were possessed,
crying with
loud
voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there
was much joy in that city: (Acts 8.6-8)
When Aeneas the paralytic was healed_
"all the residents of Lydda and Sharon
saw him; and they turned t0 the Lord" (Acts 9.35)_
When Tabitha was raised
from the dead
"it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in
the Lord" (Acts 9.42).
In the New Testament;
second purpose of miracles is tO bear witness
the
fact that the kingdom of God has come and has begun to expand its beneficial
results into people s lives; for the results of Jesus'$ miracles show the
characteristics of God $s kingdom: Jesus said, "If it is by the Spirit of God that
cast out
demons_
then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt
12.28) . His triumph over the destructive forces of Satan showed what God $
kingdom was like_
In this way; every miracle of healing Or deliverance from
demonic oppression advanced the kingdom and helped fulfill Jesus' ministry,
for he came with the Spirit of the Lord on him "tO preach
news t0 the
poor:
proclaim release to the captives and
recovering of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed" (Luke 4.18).
Similarly, Jesus gave his disciples
power and authority over all demons and
[0 cure diseases_
and he sent them out t0 preach the kingdom of God and t0
heal" (Luke 9.1-2). He commanded them; "Preach as yOu gO, saying;
The
kingdom of heaven is at hand
Heal
the sick; raise the dead_
cleanse lepers,
they
This
good
cast ouE demons
(Matt: 10.7-8; cf: Matt: 4.23; 9.35; Acts 8.6-7, 13).
A third purpose of miracles is t0 help those who are in need. The two blind
men near Jericho cried out; "Have mercy on uS_
and Jesus "in pity" healed
them (Matt: 20.30, 34). When Jesus saw
great crowd of people, "he had
compassion on them, and healed their sick" (Matt: 14.14; see also Luke 7.13)
Here miracles give evidence of the compassion of Christ toward those in
need:
fourth purpose of miracles, related t0 the second, is t0 remove hindrances
people' $ ministries
As soon as Jesus had healed Peter'
mother-in-law,
she
rose and served him" (Matt: 8.15).
When God had mercy on Epaphroditus
and restored his health (whether through miraculous means Or not, Paul
attributes
to God
mercy in Phil. 2.27), Epaphroditus was then able t0
minister to Paul and complete his function as
messenger retuming to the
Philippian church (Phil. 2.25-30). Although the text does not explicitly say
that Tabitha (or Dorcas) resumed her
good works and acts of charity" (Acts
9.36) after the Lord through Peter raised her from the dead (Acts 9.40-41),by
mentioning her good works and those who bore witness to her selfless care
for the needs of others (Acts 9.39),
suggests that she would resume
similar
ministry of mercy when she was raised
the dead:
Related t0 this
category would be the fact that Paul expects people
be edified when
miraculous gifts are used in the church (1 Cor: 12.7; 14.4,12, 26).
Finally;
fifth purpose for miracles (and one t0 which all the others
contribute) is tO
glory
God
After Jesus healed
paralytic; the crowds
"were afraid, and
glorified God, who had given such authority to men
(Matt: 9.8). Similarly, Jesus said that the man who had been blind from birth
was blind "that the works of God might be made manifest in him" (John 9.3).
Were Mlirada Restricted tO
Apo-IE?
An Unusual Concentration of Miracles in the Apostles' Ministry: Some
have argued that miracles were restricted to the apostles Or to the apostles and
those
closely connected with them_
Before
considering their arguments_
it is
important to note that there are some indications that
remarkable
concentration of miracles was characteristic of the apostles as special
representatives 0f Christ: For example
God was pleased to allow
extraordinary miracles to be done through both Peter and Paul: In the very
early days of the church;
many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of
the apostles
And more than ever believers were added t0 the
trom
bring
they
Lord, multitudes both of men and women
SO that
even carried
out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets_
thal as
Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them The
people also
gathered from the towns around Jerusalem
bringing the
sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits_
and they were all healed:
(Acts 5.12-16)
Similarly, when Paul was in Ephesus_
God did extraordinary miracles by the
hands of Paul, SO that handkerchiets Or aprons were carried away from his
body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them"
(Acts 19.11-12).
Another example is found in the
of Tabitha: when
she had died, the disciples at Joppa sent for Peter to come and pray for her
be raised from the dead (Acts 9.36-42) , apparently because
thought that
God had given an unusual concentration of miraculous power t Peter (Or to
the apostles generally)
And Paul $ ministry generally was characterized by
miraculous events_
because he summarizes his ministry by telling the Romans
of the
that Christ had worked through him tO win obedience from the
Gentiles "by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the
Spirit" (Rom: 15.19).
Nevertheless_
the unusual concentration of miracles in the ministries of the
apostles does not prove that no miracles were performed by others! As we
have clearly seen, the
working of miracles'
(1 Cor: 12.10) and other
miraculous gifts (1 Cor: 12.4-11 mentions several) were part of the ordinary
functioning of the Corinthian church, and Paul knows that God
WOrKS
miracles'
in the churches of Galatia as well (Gal. 3.5)
2. What Are the "Signs of an Apostle" in 2 Corinthians 12:12? Why then
have some
argued that miracles were uniquely the signs that distinguished an
apostle? Their case is largely based on
Corinthians 12.12, where Paul says_
"The signs of
true apostle were performed among YOu in all patience, with
signs and wonders and mighty works'
Cor: 12.12).
They say that this
implies that others who were not the apostles (or their close companions) did
not have that authority Or could not work these miraculous signs_
They
further maintain that the
of the miracles ceased when the apostles
and their close associates died. Therefore; they conclude_
no further miracles
are t0 be expected today (Those who hold this position are sometimes known
cessationists_
since they hold to the ceasing or
cessation" of miracles
early in the history 0f the church:)
considering this question, it should be remembered that in the key passage
they
raising "
they
things
Holy
working
used to establish this point; where Paul talks about "the signs of
true
apostle
Corinthians 12:12,he is not attempting to prove that he is an
apostle in distinction from other Christians who are not apostles. He is rather
attempting t0 prove that he is
tnue
representative of Christ in distinction
from others who are "false apostles'
(2 Cor: 11:13) , false representatives of
Christ; servants of Satan who are disguising themselves as
servants of
righteousness" (2 Cor: 11:14-15). In short; the contrast is not berween
apostles who could work miracles and ordinary Christians who could not; but
between genuine Christian apostles through whom the Holy Spirit worked
and non-Christian pretenders to the apostolic office, through whom the Holy
Spirit did not work at all:
Therefore
even if we understand the "signs of an
apostle
to be miracles,
should recognize that those who use this passage
argue that miracles cannot be done through Christians today are taking the
phrase "signs of an apostle
out of its context and
way that Paul
nevem
intended. Paul is distinguishing himself from non-Christians_
whereas
they use the passage t0
distinguish Paul from other Christians_
Moreover;
close examination of 2 Corinthians 12.12 shows it to be very
doubtful that the phrase "signs of an apostle
in this passage means
miraculous signs:
this very verse,
Paul
distinguishes the
signs of
luE
apostle
from miracles
which he calls
and wonders and mighty
works
that the miracles were done
with the signs of an apostle:
"The signs of
true apostle were performed among YOu in all patience, with
signs and wonders and mighty works_
The latter phrase,
"with signs and
wonders and mighty works_
has
piling up of all three terms used for
miracles and therefore muSt refer t0 miracles (note
'signs and wonders'
Acts 4.30; 5.12; 14.3; 15.12; Rom 15.19; Heb: 2.4; et al.) Therefore the
former phrase
"signs of
tnue
apostle,
must refer [0
something different;
something that was accompanied by (done
'with" ) signs and wonders.
In fact;
although the word sign in Greek (semeion) often refers
miracles, it
has
much broader range of meaning than just miracle: semeion simply
[edls
something which indicates 0r refers t0 something else_
In 2
Corinthians 12.12, the
signs'
of an
apostle are best understood as everything
that characterized Paul'
apostolic mission and showed him to be
true
apostle_
We need not guess at what these signs were, for elsewhere in 2
Corinthians Paul tells what marked him as
Tue
apostle:
1. Spiritual power in conflict with evil (10.3-4,8-11; 13.2-4, 10)
Jealous care for the welfare of the churches (11.1-6)
using
"signs
noting
along
True
knowledge of Jesus and his gospel plan (11:6)
Self-support (selflessness) (11:7-11)
Not
advantage of churches; not
people physically
(11.20-21)
Suffering and hardship endured for Christ (11.23-29)
Being caught up into heaven (12:1-6)
Contentment and faith t0 endure
thorn in the flesh (12.7-9)
9. Gaining strength out of weakness (12:10).
The first item may have included miracles
but that is certainly not the
primary focus of his reference to the "signs of
true
apostle_
Another evidence that the
signs of
true apostle'
in 2 Corinthians 12.12
were all these
and not simply miracles
the fact that Paul says,
The
signs of
tne
apostle were performed among YOu in all patience_
Now
would make little sense
say that miracles were performed "in all patience_
for many miracles happen quite quickly; but it would make much sense
say
that Paul's Christlike endurance of hardship for the sake of the Corinthians
was performed "in all patience_
We should note that nowhere
this list does Paul claim miracles to prove his
genuine apostleship. In
most of the
he mentions would nOt
distinguish him from other true Christians.
But these
distinguish
him from servants of Satan; false apostles who are not Christians at all: their
lives will not be marked by humility, but pride; not by selflessness, but
selfishness; not by generosity; but greed; not by seeking the advantage of
others_
but by
taking advantage of others;
not by spiritual power in physical
weakness
but by confidence in their natural strength; not by enduring
suffering and hardship, but by
their own comfort and ease_
When
Paul acted
Christlike manner among them, his actions were
signs" that
his claim t0 be an
apostle was
true claim: thus_
these
were
signs of
true
apostle_
In this context; the "signs" that mark
true
apostle need not be
things that showed an absolute difference between him and other Christians,
but rather things that showed his ministry to be genuine; in distinction from
false ministries. He
not here
the Corinthians how [0 tell who an
apostle was in distinction from other Christians (he did that in
Cor: 9.1-2;
15.7-11; Gal: 1:1_
11-24, mentioning seeing the risen Christ and being
taking
striking
things
facl,
things
things
seeking
things
telling "
commissioned by him as an apostle), but here he
telling how to recognize
whal
genuine, Christ-approved ministry was
Why then does he add that all these signs of
true
apostle were done among
the Corinthians "with signs and wonders and mighty works" ? He is simply
adding
additional factor to all the previous marks of his genuine
apostleship. Miracles of course had
significant function in confirming the
truth of Paul'$ message, and Paul here makes explicit what the Corinthians
may Or may not have assumed t0 be included in the phrase
'signs of
[ue
apostle
addition t0 all these other signs of
true apostle
his ministry
showed miraculous demonstrations of God's power as well
There
another very
significant reason why miracles did not prove
someone t0 be an
apostle_
In the
larger context of the New Testament it is
clear that miracles were worked by others than apostles_
such as Stephen
(Acts 6.8) , Philip (Acts 8.6-7), Christians in the several churches in Galatia
(Gal. 3.5) , and those with gifts of
miracles
in the body of Christ generally
Cor: 12.10, 28)_
Miracles as such cannot then be
regarded as exclusively
signs of an apostle_
In fact;
workers of miracles'
and "healers" are actually
distinguished
apostles
Corinthians 12.28:
And God has
appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets; third teachers_
then
workers of miracles_
then healers_
Similar evidence is seen in Mark 16.17-18: Though there are serious
questions about the authenticity of this passage as part of Mark's gospel,
the
[ext
nonetheless very early
and at least bears witness t0 one strand of
tradition within the early church: This text reports Jesus as saying;
And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they
will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
will pick
up serpents_
and if
drink any deadly
it will not hurt them;
they will lay their hands on the sick; and they will recover:
Here also the power tO work miracles
assumed to be the common
possession of Christians_
Those who wrote and passed on this early tradition;
and who thought it represented the genuine teaching of Jesus_
were certainly
not aware of any idea that miracles were t0 be limited to the apostles and their
close associates_
The argument that many other Christians in the New Testament worked
miracles is sometimes answered by the claim that it was only the apostles and
one
Fe[
from
they
they
thing;
those closely associated with them Or those on whom the apostles laid their
hands who could work miracles_
However; this really proves very little
because the story of the New Testament church is the story of what was done
through the apostles and those closely associated with them_
similar
argument might be made about
evangelism Or the founding of churches: "In
the New Testament; churches were only founded by the apostles 0r their close
associates; therefore
we should not found churches today:
Or; "In the New
Testament; missionary work in other countries was only done by the apostles
their close associates_
therefore;
should not do missionary work in other
countries today:
These
analogies show the inadequacy of the argument: the
New Testament primarily shows how the church should seek to act; not how it
should not seek t0 act:
But if many other Christians throughout the first-century church were
miracles by the power of the Holy Spirit; then the power tO work
miracles could not be
sign to distinguish the apostles from other Christians_
3. Norman Geisler'$ Restrictive Definition of Miracles_
more recent
attempt t0 deny that miracles occur today has been made by Norman
Geisler:
Geisler has
much more restrictive definition of miracle than that
presented in this chapter; and he uses that definition to argue
the
possibility of contemporary miracles. Geisler says that "miracles (1) are
always successful, (2) are immediate_
have no relapses
and (4) give
confirmation of God s messenger" (chapter
He finds support for this thesis
largely in the ministry of Jesus_
but when he passes beyond the life of Jesus
and attempts
show that others who had the power [0 work miracles were
nevem
unsuccessful; his thesis is much less
convincing: With regard
the
demon-possessed
whom the disciples could not set free from the demon
(Matt: 17.14-21), Geisler says that
disciples simply forgot for the
moment to faithfully exercise the power that Jesus had already given them"
(chapter
But this
unpersuasive argument: Geisler says that the power
[0 work miracles was
always successful, and when the Bible talks about some
who were unsuccessful (and who contradict his thesis) he simply says
"forgoc
Jesus; however; gives
different reason than Geisler:
Because of
your little faith" (Matt: 17.20). Lesser faith resulted in lesser power t0 work
miracles_
With
regard
Paul s failure to heal Epaphroditus (Phil. 2.27), Geisler is
forced t0 make the dubious claim that perhaps Paul never attempted to heal
Epaphroditus (though he had come to him in prison and was so ill he almost
died), or that "Paul no longer possessed the gift of healing at this time
working
against
boy
#the
they
(chapter Z)
He employs the same claim to explain the fact that Paul left
Trophimus ill at Miletus
Tim. 4.20). In these instances Geisler goes well
beyond the usual cessationist claim that miracles ended with the death of the
apostles
he is
that miracles ceased in the life of the greatest apostle
before his first Roman imprisonment: That is simply an unconvincing
argument with respect t0 the apostle whose ministry was repeatedly
characterized "by the power of signs and wonders; by the power of the
Spirit" (Rom: 15.19), and who could say with triumph in his last epistle
have
fought the good fight;
have finished the race;
have kepr the
'Tim: 47).
Geisler =
description of miracles does not fit the case of the blind man upon
whom Jesus laid his hands, for at
the man did not see clearly but said he
saw men who "look like trees_
walking
After Jesus laid his hands on him
second time, the man
saw everything clearly" (Mark 8.24-25). Geisler
responds thar it was Jesus
intention [0 heal in [WO stages,
teach the
disciples by using an object lesson about the gradual growth of their spiritual
lives (chapter
section C) Though the text says
L0 this effect, it may
have been true, but even S0 it disproves Geisler's thesis_
for if it was Jesus
intention to heal in two stages then; it may also be his intention to heal people
in two stages today
or in three or four 0r more stages_
Once Geisler admits
that
may be God's intention tO work
miracle in stages, in order to
accomplish his
An
purposes_
then his entire claim that miracles must be
immediate and complete is lost:
Instead of accepting Geisler's definition; it seems better to conclude that even
those whom God gifts
the ability to perform miracles may not be able t0
perform them whenever
wish, for the Holy Spirit continually is
distributing them t0 each person
he wills" (1 Cor: 12.11; the word
distributes is
present participle in Greek, indicating
continuing activity of
the Holy Spirit)
Moreover; there seems n0 reason
exclude (as Geisler
apparently wants to do) unusual 0r remarkable answers t0 prayer from the
category of "miracle,
thus
the definition extremely restrictive. If God
answers
persistent prayer; for instance, for
physical healing for which there
is no known medical explanation, and does s0 only after several months 0r
years of prayer; yet does s0 in such
way that
seems quite clearly to be in
response
prayer s0 that people are amazed and glorify God
there seems no
reason
deny that
miracle has occurred simply because the earlier prayers
were not answered immediately Finally, Geisler fails t0
recognize that several
New Testament texts indicate that spiritual gifts_
whether miraculous 0r
nonmiraculous
nature, may vary in strength or degree of intensity:

Hebrews 2:3-4.
Another passage that
sometimes used to support the
idea that miracles were limited tO the apostles and their close associates is
Hebrews 2.3-4. There the author says that the message of salvation
was
declared at first by the Lord, and
was attested tO us by those who heard
while God also bore witness
by signs and wonders and various miracles and
by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will
Since the miracles here are said tO come through those who heard the Lord
firsthand
"those who heard him
it is argued that we should not expect
them to be done through others who were not firsthand witnesses tO the
Lord'$ teaching and ministry:
But this argument also attempts tO draw more from the passage than
there:
the phrase "those who heard him" (Heb: 2.3)
certainly not limited to
the apostles, for many others heard Jesus aS well. But more importantly, this
position is claiming something that the text simply does not say: the fact that
the gospel message was confirmed by miracles when it was preached by
those who heard Jesus says
at all about (2
whether it would be
confirmed by miracles when preached by others who did not hear Jesus
Finally, this passage says the message was confirmed not only by "signs and
wonders and various miracles'
but also by "gifts of the Holy Spirit:
someone argues that this passage limits miracles t0 the apostles and their
companions, then he or she must also argue that gifts of the
Spirit are
likewise limited t0 the first-century church:
But few would argue that there
are nO gifts of the
Spirit today
Conclusion: Were Miracles Restricted t0 the Apostles? If ministry in the
power and glory of the Holy Spirit is characteristic of the new covenant age
Cor: 3.1-4.18) , then our expectation would be just the opposite: we would
expect that second and third and fourth generation Christians_
who also know
Christ and the power of his resurection (Phil. 3.10),
who are continually
being filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph 5.17), who are participants in

have put on the whole armor of God in order t0 be able to stand against
principalities and powers and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places (Eph: 6.10-12) , would also have the ability

preaching of the apostles should come
not in
plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
that
faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God"
Cor: 2.4-5).
Though there does seem to have been an unusual concentration of miraculous
power in the
ministry of the apostles, this is not
reason for thinking that
there would be few 0r nO miracles
following their deaths. Rather; the apostles
were the leaders in

work miracles for the edification of the church
False Miracles
Pharaoh $ magicians were able to work some false miracles (Ex: 7:11,22;
8.7) , though they soon had to admit that God'$ power was greater (Ex. 8.19).
Simon the sorcerer in the city of Samaria amazed people with his magic (Acts
8.9-11), even though the miracles done through Philip were much greater
(Acts 8.13). In Philippi Paul encountered
slave girl
who had
spirit of
divination and
brought her owners much gain by soothsaying
(Acts 16.16),
but Paul rebuked the spirit and it came out of her (Acts 16.18). Moreover;
Paul says that when the man of sin comes it "will be with all power and with
pretended signs and wonders_
and with all wicked deception for those who are
perish" (2 Thess. 2.9-10), but those who follow them and are deceived do
so "because
refused t0 love the truth and so be saved" (2 Thess 2.10).
This indicates that those who work false miracles in the end times by the
power of Satan will not speak the truth but
preach
false gospel. Finally,
Revelation 13 indicates thar
second beast will rise
out of the earth;
one
that has "all the authority of the first beast"
and
wOrks great Signs, even
making fire come down from heaven t0 earth in the sight of men; and by the
signs which it is allowed t0 work in the presence of the beast;
deceives
those who dwell on earth" (Rev: 13.11-14).
But once
false gospel
accompanies these miracles: this power is exercised in connection with the
first beast who utters "haughty and blasphemous words
it opened its
mouth t0 utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his
dwelling" (Rev: 13.5-6).
Two conclusions become clear from this brief survey of false miracles in
Scripture:
The power of God is greater than the power of Satan t0 work
miraculous signs
and God $ people triumph in confrontations of power with
YouF
Holy

again
those who work evil. In connection with this_
John assures believers that "he
who is in YOu is greater than he who is in the world" (1 John 4.4).
The
identity of these workers of false miracles
always known through their
denial of the gospel There is no indication anywhere in Scripture that
genuine Christians with the Holy Spirit in them will work false miracles. In
city filled with idolatry and demon worship (see
Cor: 10.20), Paul
could say t0 the Corinthian believers, many of whom had come out of that
kind of pagan background_
that
no one can say
Jesus is Lord' except by the
Holy Spirit" (1 Cor: 12.3). Here he gives them reassurance that those who
make
genuine profession of faith in Jesus as Lord do in fact have the Holy
Spirit in them. It is significant that he immediately goes on tO
discussion of
spiritual
possessed Dy
each" true believer (1 Cor: 12.7).
This should reassure uS that if we see miracles
worked by those who
make
genuine profession of faith (1 Cor: 12.3), who believe in the
incarnation and deity of Christ (1 John 4.2), and who show the
of the
Holy Spirit in their lives and bear fruit in their ministry (Matt: 7.20; cf: John
15.5; Gal. 5.22-23), we should not be suspicious that they are false miracles
but should be thankful to God that the Holy Spirit is working, even in those
who may not hold exactly the same convictions that we do 0n every
doctrine:
Indeed
if God waited t0 work miracles only through those who
were perfect in both doctrine and conduct of life; no miracles would be
worked until Christ returns.

It is one
say that miracles might occur today: It is
another
to ask God for miracles_
[s it right then for Christians
ask God t0 perform
miracles?
The answer depends on the purpose for which miracles are sought Certainly
it is wrong
seek miraculous power [0 advance one
own power 0r fame, as
Simon the magician did: Peter said to him;
your heart is not right before
God. Repent therefore of this wickedness of yOurs; and pray t0 the Lord
if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you'
(Acts 8.21-22).
It is also wrong t0 seek miracles simply to be entertained, as Herod did:
"When Herod saw Jesus
he was very
for he had
desired t0 see him,
because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by
him" (Luke 23.8). But Jesus would not even answer Herod's questions_
It is also wrong for skeptical unbelievers to seek miracles simply to find
fact,

long
ground to criticize those who preach the gospel:
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and

asked
him t0 show them
sign from heaven_
He answered them;
evil and adulterous
generation seeks for
sign; but no sign shall be
given [0 it except the sign of Jonah
(Matt. 16.1-4)
This rebuke
signs is repeated elsewhere in the Gospels
but ic
is important to note that rebukes against seeking signs are always directed
against hostile unbelievers who are seeking
miracle only as an opportunity
criticize Jesus.
Never does Jesus rebuke anyone who comes in faith, or in
need,
seeking healing
deliverance 0r any other kind of miracle_
whether for
himself or herself; or for others.
What shall we say then about
Corinthians 1.22-24, where Paul says,
For
Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified_
stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles
but t0 those who are called_
both Jews and Greeks
Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God"?
Does Paul mean that he did not work miracles
"signs
Corinth; Or perhaps
in his
evangelistic work generally?
Here Paul cannot be denying that he performed miracles in connection with
the proclamation of the gospel. In fact; in Romans 15.18-19,
passage he
wrote while in Corinth; he said,
For
will not venture [0
speak of anything except what Christ has
wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles; by word and
deed_
by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy
Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum
have
fully preached the gospel of Christ:
And 2 Corinthians 12:12 affirms clearly that Paul did work "signs and
wonders and mighty works" among them:
Corinthians 1.22-24 cannot mean that Paul was denying the validity of
wisdom O1 the validity of signs; for through Christ he worked signs and he
taught wisdom. Rather; here he is saying that signs and wisdom do not
themselves save people; but the gospel saves people. Signs and the wisdom
that Jews and Greeks were seeking were not the signs and wisdom of Christ
but simply signs tO entertain O1 t0 fuel their hostility and skepticism and
wisdom that was the wisdom of the world rather than the wisdom of God_

bring help to those in need, to remove hindrances to people $
ministries
and [0
bring glory to God (see Section € above). In the Gospels
many people came t0 Jesus
seeking miracles_
and he healed them fOL these
purposes_
Moreover; when he sent his disciples out preaching that the
kingdom of heaven was at hand
he told them; "Heal the sick, raise the dead_
cleanse lepers_
cast out demons"
(Matc: 10.7-8)-
How could they do this
without
seeking God for miracles everywhere they
Jesus' command
required them
seek for miracles to happen.
After Pentecost; the early church prayed both for boldness t0 preach the
gospel and for God to grant miracles to accompany its preaching: They cried
out to God,
And now; Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants [O
speak your word with all boldness, while YOu stretch out your hand to
heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your
servant Jesus. (Acts 4.29-30)
Far trom
teaching that we should not ask God for miracles, this example of
the early church gives us some encouragement t0 do so. Similarly; the
disciples in Lydda sent for Peter to come and pray for Tabitha after she had
died, thereby seeking
miraculous intervention by God (Acts 9.38). And
James directs that the elders of the church should pray and seek healing for
those who are
(James 5.14). Of course_
we should not assume that an
obviously miraculous answer t0 prayer is somehow better than one that comes
through ordinary means (such as medical help for sickness), and we must also
realize that
God for
particular need does not guarantee that the prayer
will be answered
On the other hand_
our faith that God will work in powerful
and even miraculous ways may be far tO0 small_
We must beware of being
infected by
secular worldview that assumes that God will answer prayer
only very seldom; if ever: And we should certainly not be embarrassed to talk
about miracles if they occur
think thar
nonmiraculous answer t0 prayer
is better! Miracles are God s work; and he works them to bring glory to
himself and
strengthen Our faith When we encounter serious needs in
people $ lives today; it is right for uS to seek God for an answer; and where
miraculous intervention seems t0 be needed, then to ask God if he would be
pleased to work in that way.
This would seem to be especially appropriate
when 0ur' molivation iS

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
When you first came t0 faith in Christ; did the stories of miracles in the
Bible have any influence (negative or positive) on your believing the
message of Scripture?
Before reading this chapter; have YOu thought of the church at the time of
the New 'lestament as
church with frequent miracles? Have yOu
thought of the contemporary church as one with frequent miracles? After
this chapter; how has yOur position changed, if at all?
If you think that miracles should be characteristic of the church until
Christ returs, then why have we nOt seen very many miracles at many
points in the history of the church; and why do we not see many miracles
in large sections of the Christian church today?
If you hold
cessationist" position, what kinds of unusual answers t0
prayer might YOu still think possible today? (For example, prayer for
physical
for deliverance from
danger; victory over demonic
attack through prayer andlor verbal rebuke of an
spirit, Or sudden
and unusual insight into
passage of Scripture 01
situation in
someone
life_
How would you distinguish these
that you might
think possible today from
miracles
according
to the definition given in
this chapter? ( You may wish to argue for
different definition of
miracle" as well.)
Do miracles have t0 be
large and "remarkable" (such as
the dead
healing
man blind from birth)
accomplish useful purposes in the
church today? What kinds of "small-scale'
miracles might also
accomplish some of the purposes for miracles listed
this chapter?
Have you known of any answers t0 prayer in your Own church (0r your
own life) that you would characterize as "miraculous'
according to the
definition given at the
beginning of the chapter?
Would you like to see more miraculous power of the Holy Spirit (or
MUIE
unusual answers [0
prayer) at work in YOur own church today; Or
not? If more miracles did Occur; what might be the dangers? What might
be the benefits?

A mighty fortress is our God_

Our helper he amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek t0 work uS woe;
His craft and pOw'r are great; and, armed with cruel
hate,

Did we in our own strength confide
our striving would be losing;
Were not the right man on our side, the man of God*s own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabaoth his name_

And he must win the battle_
And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear; for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us
The prince of darkness
tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo! his doom is sure;
failing;
grim,
One little word shall fell him.
That

Prayer
Why does God want us to pray? How can we pray effectively?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The character of God and his relationship to the world, as discussed in the
previous chapters
lead naturally to
consideration of the doctrine
prayer:
Prayer may be defined as follows-
Prayer
personal communication with
God:
This definition is
broad:
What we call "prayer" includes prayers of
request
for ourselves or for others (sometimes called prayers of petition or
intercession), confession of sin; adoration; praise and
thanksgiving; and also
God
communicating t0 Us indications of his response.
Alny Walnden
Prit
Prayer
made s0 that God can find out what we need_
because Jesus tells
"Your Father knows what you need before you ask him
(Matt: 6.8). God
wants US to pray because prayer expresses Our trust in God and is
means
whereby Our trust in him can increase_
In fact; perhaps the primary emphasis
of the Bible-
teaching on prayer is that we are t0 pray with faith, which
means trust Or dependence on God: God as our Creator delights in
trusted by US as his creatures, for an attitude of dependence
most
appropriate tO the Creator/creature relationship
in humble
dependence also indicates that we are
genuinely convinced of God*$ wisdom;
love, goodness, and power
-indeed of all of the attributes that make up his
excellent character: When we truly pray; we as persons, in the wholeness of
character; are
to God as
person, in the wholeness of his
character: Thus; all that we think or feeb
about God comes to expression in our
prayer:
is only natural that God would
delight in such activity and place
much emphasis on it in his relationship with us_
The first words of the Lord s Prayer; "Our Father who art in heaven'
(Malt:
6.9), acknowledge
dependence on God as
loving and wise Father and
very
being
Praying
relating
our
also recognize that he rules over all from his heavenly throne. Scripture many
times emphasizes our need t0 trust God as we pray: For example
Jesus
compares our praying [0
son
asking his father for
fish or an egg (Luke
11.9-12) and then concludes; "If you then, who are evil, know how to give
good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to those who ask
(Luke 11:13). As children look t0 their
fathers to provide for them, so God expects US t0 look to him in prayer: Since
God is our Father; we should ask in faith. Jesus says_
Whatever YOu ask in
prayer; YOu will receive; if you have faith" (Matt: 21.22; cf Mark 11:24;
James 1.6-8; 5.14-15).
But God does not only want us t0 trust him. He also wants uS t0 love him and
have fellowship
him: This, then, is
second reason why God wants US t0
pray: Prayer brings 4s into deeper fellowship with God_
and he loves uS and
delights in our fellowship with him
third reason God wants US [O pray is that in prayer God allows US as
creatures to be involved in activities that are eternally important: When we
pray; the work of the kingdom is advanced_
In this way; prayer gives 4S
opportunity
be involved in
significant way in the work of the kingdom
and thus gives expression
our
greatness as creatures made in God $ image.
DThe Electi;enex
Pater
How exactly does prayer work? Does prayer not only do uS good but also
affect God and the world?
Prayer Changes the Way God Acts. James tells uS_
You do nor have
because you do not ask'
(James 4.2). He implies that failure t0 ask deprives
uS of what God would otherwise have given to US
We pray; and God
responds
Jesus also says_
Ask; and it will be given you; seek, and you will
find; knock; and it will be opened to you: For every one who asks receives
and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened" (Luke
11.9-10). He makes
clear connection between seeking things from God and
receiving them. When we ask, God responds
We see this happening many times in the Old Testament: The Lord declared to
Moses that he would destroy the people of Israel for their sin (Ex: 32.9-10):
"But Moses besought the LORD his God
and said,
'0 Lord:
Turn from
your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people
(Ex. 32.11-
12). Then we read, "And the LORD repented of the
which he thought to do
his people" (Ex 32.14). When God threatens t0 punish his people for their
sins he declares
"If my people who are called by my name humble
hin! "
with
evil
themselves,
and pray and seek my face_
and turn from their wicked ways_
then
Iwill hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land" (2
Chron. 7:14). If and when God'$ people pray (with humility and repentance),
then he will hear and forgive them. The prayers of his people clearly affect
how God acts_
Similarly; "If we confess our sins_
he is faithful and just, and
will forgive our sins and cleanse Us from all unrighteousness
John 1.9).
We confess, and then he forgives.
If we were really convinced that prayer changes the way God acts, and that
God does
about remarkable changes in the world in response tO prayer;
as Scripture repeatedly teaches that he does; then we would pray much more
than we do. If we pray little, it is probably because we do not really believe
that prayer accomplishes much at all_
2. Effective Prayer Is Made Possible by Our Mediator; Jesus Christ
Because we are sinful and God is holy; we have no right on Our Ow [0 enter

We need
mediator t0 come between US and God and t0
bring US into God $ presence. Scripture clearly teaches;
There is one God,
and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus
Tim: 2.5).
But if Jesus is the only mediator between God and man, will God hear the
prayers of those who do not trust in Jesus? The answer depends on what
mean by "hear:"
Since God is omniscient; he always "hears'
in the sense thal
he is aware of the prayers made by unbelievers who do not come to him
through Christ. God may even_
from time t0 time
answer their prayers out of
his mercy and in
desire
bring them t0 salvation through Christ. However;
God has nowhere promised to respond to the prayers of unbelievers:
The only
prayers that he has promised to "hear" in the sense of
listening with _
sympathetic ear and undertaking
answer when they are made
according to
his will, are the prayers of Christians offered through the one mediator; Jesus
Christ (cf. John 14.6).
Then what about believers in the Old Testament? How could they come t0
God through Jesus the mediator? The answer is that the work of Jesus as our
mediator was foreshadowed by the sacrificial system and the
made
by the priests in the temple (Heb
7.23-28; 8.1-6; 9.1-14; et al.) There was
saving merit inherent
that system of sacrifices (Heb: 10.1-4), however:
Through the sacrificial system believers were accepted by God only on the
basis of the future work of Christ foreshadowed by that system (Rom: 3.23
26).
bring
offerings
Jesus' activity as
mediator is especially seen in his work as
priest: he
0ur
great high priest who has passed through the heavens _
one who "in every
respect has been tempted as we are,
without sin" (Heb. 414-15).
As recipients of the new covenant; we do not need to stay
outside the
temple,
as all believers except the priests were required to do under the old
covenant Nor do we need t0 stay outside of the
of Holies'
(Heb: 9.3),
the inner room of the temple where God himself was enthroned above the ark
of the covenant and where only the high priest could g0_
and he but once
year: But now; since Christ has died as Our mediational High Priest (Heb_
7.26-27) , he has gained for us boldness and access to the very presence of
God
Therefore
have confidence t0 enter into the holy places by the
blood of Jesus" (Heb. 10.19,author's literal translation), that is, into the holy
place and into the holy of holies_
the very presence of God himself! We enter
"by the new and living way" (Heb:
10.20) that Christ opened for uS.
The
author of Hebrews concludes that since these things are true,
and since
have
great priest over the house of God_
let 4S draw near with
true heart in
full assurance of faith" (Heb. 10.22). In this way; Christ $ mediational work
gives Us confidence t0 approach God in prayer:
We do not just come into God $ presence as strangers
or as visitors, Or as
laypersons, but as priests
as people who
belong in the temple and have
right and even
the most sacred places in the temple:
imagery from the ceremony for ordination of priests (see Ex. 29.4, 21), the
author of Hebrews pictures all believers as having been ordained as priests t0
God and thus able o enter into his presence, for he says that we draw near
"with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies
washed with pure
(Heb: 10.22; cf:
2.9). Does all this make
sense t0
modern Christian? No one today goes t0 Jerusalem tO enter the
temple and there "draw near" to God_
Even if we did go to Jerusalem; we
would find no temple standing; since it was destroyed in AD. 70. What then
does the author of
Hebrews mean when he says we enter into the "holy
places
He is talking about
reality in the unseen spiritual realm: With
Christ as our Mediator we enter not into the earthly temple in Jerusalem; but
into the true sanctuary, into "heaven itself;'
where Christ has

(Heb. 9.24).
What Is Praying *in Jesus' Name"? Jesus says,
Whatever YOU ask in my
name;
will do it, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son; if you ask
anything in my name
will do it" (John 14.13-14). He also says that he
chose his disciples
'so that whatever You ask the Father in my name, he may
give it tO you" (John 15.16). Similarly, he says
Truly; truly;

you ask anything of the Father; he will give
t0 you in my name. Hitherto
you have asked nothing in my name; ask; and yOu will receive, that your joy
may be full" (John 16.23-24; cf: Eph: 5.20). But what does this mean?
Clearly it does not simply mean adding the phrase "in Jesus' name
after
every prayer; because Jesus did not say, "If you ask anything and add the
words *in Jesus
name
after your prayer;
will do it
Jesus is nOt merely
speaking about_
certain words as if these were
kind of magical
formula that would give power
t0 our prayers.
fact; none of the prayers
recorded in Scripture have the phrase "in Jesus' name
at the end of them (see
Matt: 6.9-13; Acts 1.24-25, 4.24-30;" 7.59; 9.13-14; 10.14; Rev: 6.10;
22.20).
To come in the name of someone means that another person has authorized us
to come on his authority; not on Our own. When Peter commands the lame
man, "in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth; walk" (Acts 3.6), he is
speaking on the authority of Jesus, not on his own authority. When the
Sanhedrin asks the disciples,;
By what power or by what name did you do
this?" (Acts 4.7) , they are asking;
By whose authority did yOu do this?"
When Paul rebukes an unclean spirit "in the name of Jesus Christ" (Acts
16.18) , he makes
clear that he is
S0 on Jesus' authority, not his own_
When Paul pronounces judgment "in the name of the Lord Jesus" (1 Cor: 5.4)

broader sense the
'name
person in the ancient world represented the
person himself and therefore all of his character: To have

(Prov: 22:1; Eccl: 7:1) was to have

Thus, the name of Jesus
represents all that he is, his entire character: This means that praying
Jesus
name
is not only praying in his authority; but also praying in
way
that is consistent with his character; that truly represents him and reflects his
manner of life and his own holy will.
In this sense,
pray in Jesus' name
comes close t0 the idea of
praying "according to his will"

Does this mean thal

sort of magic formula that makes prayer more
effective: To prevent such misunderstanding
it would probably be wise
decide not t0 use the formula frequently and tO express the same thought in
other wordS;
or simply in the overall attitude and approach we take toward
prayer: For example, prayers could begin, "Father;
we come [0 YOU in the
authority of Our Lord Jesus,
Son
0r; "Father; we do not come 0n our
own merits but on the merits of Jesus Christ, Who has invited uS t0 come
before you
"Father; we thank you for forgiving OUr sins and giving uS
access t0 YOur throne by the work of Jesus your Son
At other times even
these formal acknowledgments should not be thought necessary; so long as
our hearts continually realize that it is our Savior who enables US to pray t0
the Father at all_
Genuine prayer is conversation with
Person whom we
know well, and who knows us. Such genuine conversation between persons
who know each other never depends on the use of certain formulas 01
required words_
but is
matter of sincerity in our speech and in our heart;
matter of right attitudes, and
matter of the condition of our spirit
Should We
Jesus and to the Holy Spirit? A survey of the prayers
of the New Testament indicates thar
are usually addressed neither to God
the Son nor t0 the Holy Spirit; but to God the Father: Yet _
mere count of such
prayers may be misleading
for the majority of the prayers we have recorded
in the New Testament are those of Jesus himself; who constantly prayed t0
God the Father; but of course did not pray t0 himself as God the Son_
Moreover; in the Old Testament, the trinitarian nature 0f God was nOt SO
clearly revealed, and it is not
surprising that we do not find much evidence of
prayer addressed directly to God the Son 01
God the Holy Spirit before the
time of Christ
Though there is
clear pattern of prayer directly to God the Father through
the Son (Matt: 6.9; John 16.23; Eph: 5.20) there are indications that prayer
spoken directy
Jesus is also appropriate. The fact that
was Jesus himself
who appointed all of the other apostles_
suggests that the prayer in Acts 1.24
is addressed t0 him: "Lord
who knows the hearts of all men, show which one
these two You have chosen:
The dying Stephen prays, "Lord Jesus
receive my
(Acts 7.59). The conversation between Ananias and
'the
Lord" in Acts 9.10-16 is with Jesus_
because in verse 17 Ananias tells Saul,
"The Lord Jesus
has sent me that you may
regain your sight:
The prayer;
"Our Lord, comel" (1 Cor: 16.22) is addressed t0 Jesus
as is the prayer in
Revelation 22.20,"Come
Lord Jesus!" And Paul also prayed to "the Lord" in
2 Corinthians 12.8 concerning his thorn in the flesh_
Moreover; the fact that Jesus is

2.17) who is able to "sympathize with our weaknesses" (Heb. 4.15), is viewed
as an
encouragement t0 US to come boldly before the "throne of grace"
prayer "that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need"
(Heb. 4.16). These verses muSt give 4S encouragement tO come directly t0
Jesus in prayer; expecting that he will sympathize with Our weaknesses a5 we
pray.
There is therefore clear enough scriptural warrant to encourage uS t0 pray not
only
God the Father (which seems t0 be the primary pattern, and certainly
follows the example that Jesus taught us in the Lord $ Prayer), but also to pray
directly to God the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Both are correct; and we may
pray either to the Father or t0 the Son:
But should we pray
the Holy Spirit? Though no prayers directly addressed
t0 the Holy Spirit are recorded in the New Testament; there is nothing that
would forbid such prayer; for the Holy Spirit, like the Father and the Son, is
fully God and is worthy
prayer and is powerful tO answer OUI prayers _
(Note also Ezekiel $ invitation t0 the "breath" or
spirit" in Ezek: 37.9.) To
say that we cannot pray t0 the
Spirit is really saying that we cannot talk

Spirit exercises personal

(1 Cor: 12.11

Therefore, it does not seem wrong tO pray directly t0 the Holy
Spirit at times_
particularly when we are asking him t0 do something that
relates to his special areas of ministry or responsibility:
through the
history of the church several well-used hymns have been prayers t0 the
Spirit (see two at the end of chapter 30, one at chapter 52_
and one
chapter
53). But this
not the New Testament pattem; and
should not become the
dominant emphasis in our prayer life_
The Role of the Holy Spirit in Our Praying: In Romans 8.26-27 Paul
says:
Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how
pray as
ought; but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs
t0o deep for words.
And he who searches the hearts of men knows
what is the mind of the Spirit; because the Spirit intercedes for the
saints according
the will of God_
Holy

Interpreters differ on whether the
sighs too
for words" are the sighs the
Holy Spirit himself makes or Our Own sighs and groans in prayer; which the
Holy Spirit makes into effective prayer before God. It seems more likely that
the "sighs
groans"
here are our groans_
When Paul says, "The Spirit
helps us in our weakness
26) , the word translated ~helps" (Gk:
sunantilambanomai) is the same word used in Luke 10.40
where Martha
wants
Mary t0 come and help her: The word does not indicate that the
Spirit prays instead of us, but that the Holy Spirit takes part with us and
makes Our weak prayers effective.
Thus
such sighing 0r groaning in prayer
is best understood to be sighs Or groans which we utter;
expressing the desires
of our heart and spirit; which the Holy Spirit then makes into effective
prayer:
Related t0 this is the question of what it means t0 pray "in the Spirit:
Paul
says; "Pray at all times in the Spirit; with all prayer and supplication
(Eph
6.18) , and Jude says,; "pray in the Holy Spirit" (Jude 20).
In order t0
understand this phrase
we should realize that the New Testament tells us that
many different activities can be done "in the Holy Spirit
It is possible just t0
be "in the Spirit" as John was on the Lord' $
(Rev: 1.10; cf: 4.2). And it is
possible
rejoice in the Holy Spirit (Luke 10.21), tO resolve or decide
something in the Holy Spirit (Acts 19.21), to have one $ conscience bear
witness
the Holy Spirit (Rom: 9.1), to have access t0 God in the Holy Spirit
(Eph: 218) , and to love in the Holy Spirit (Col: 1.8). As we will explain more
fully
chapter 30 below, these expressions seem tO refer to
dwelling
consciously in the presence of the Holy Spirit himself;
presence
characterized by the Godlike qualities of power;
joy, truth; holiness
righteousness_
and peace_
To pray "in the Holy Spirit;
is tO pray with
the conscious awareness of God'$ presence surrounding us and sanctifying
both us and our prayers_

Scripture indicates
number of considerations that need t0 be taken into
account if we would offer the kind of prayer that God desires from uS.
Praying According to God's Will. John tells us,
"This is the confidence
which we have in him, that if we ask
anything according
his will he hears
And if we know that he hears US in whatever we ask; we know that we
have obtained the requests made of him"
John 5.14-15). Jesus teaches US
[0 pray,
Your will be done
(Matt: 6.10), and he himself gives US an example,
by praying in the garden of Gethsemane; "Nevertheless
not as
will, but as
deep
Holy
day
luve
then;
Fotn
you will" (Matt: 26.39).
But how do
know what God' $ will is when we pray? If the matter
are
praying about
covered in_
passage of Scripture in which God gives uS
command Or
direct declaration of his will, then the answer t0 this question is
easy: His will is that his Word be obeyed and that his commands be kepL We
are t0 seek for perfect obedience t0 God $ moral will on earth s0 that God $
will may be done
on earth as it is in heaven'
(Matt: 6.10). For this reason
knowledge of Scripture is
tremendous help in prayer;
enabling us to follow
the pattern of the first Christians who quoted Scripture when
prayed (see
Acts 4.25-26)
The
regular reading and memorization of Scripture
cultivated
over many years of
Christian's life, will increase the depth_
power; and
wisdom of his or her prayers_
Jesus encourages uS to have his words within 4S
as we pray; for he says, "If you abide in me, and my words abide in YOu, ask
whatever YOu will, and it shall be done for you
(John 15.7).
This means
for example_
that if we are seeking wisdom in the
making of an
important decision, we do not have t0 wonder whether it is God's will that we
receive wisdom [0 act
rightly Scripture has already settled that question for
because there is
promise of Scripture that applies-
If any of you lacks wisdom
let him ask God, who gives to all men
generously and without
reproaching: and it will be given him. But let
him ask in faith, with no doubting; for he who doubts is like
wave of
the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not
suppose that
double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, will
receive anything from the Lord. (James 1.5-8)
We should have great confidence that God will answer Our prayer when we
ask him for
something that accords with _
specific promise Or command of
Scripture like this- In such cases, We know what God' $ will is, because he has
told uS
and we simply need to pray believing that he will answer:
However; there are many other situations in life where
do not know what
God's will is.
We may nOt be sure
because no promise or command of
Scripture applies
whether it is God'$ will that we get the job we have applied
for; or win an athletic contest in which we are participating

In all of these cases_
should bring to bear as much of Scripture as we
understand, perhaps tO give LS some general
principles within which
prayer can be made
But beyond this_
we often must admit that we simply do

understanding and then pray for what seems best to US, giving reasons to the
Lord why, in Our present
understanding of the situation; what we are praying
for seems to be best But it is always right to add_
either explicitly or at least
in the attitude of our heart; "Nevertheless, if

this is not pleasing [0 You, then do as seems best in your sight;

we are led t0 ask
something differently: Sometimes he will not grant Our
request at all but will simply indicate t0 US that we must submit to his
(see 2 Cor: 12.9-10).
Some Christians object that to add the phrase "if it is your will" to Our prayers
destroys our faith:
What
actually does is express uncertainty about
whether what we pray for is God's will 0r not. And it is appropriate when
do not really know what God $ will is. But at other times this would not be
appropriate: [0 ask God [0 give US wisdom

"Ifit is your will t0 give me wisdom here

would be saying that we do not believe God meant what he said in James 1.5-
when he told us

Even when

there may be nuances
of application that we do not at first fully understand. Therefore it is

mind that would enable us to pray more effectively; impart
sense of assurance of what his will is, 0r
greatly increase our faith so that we
are able to pray with much more confidence.
Praying With Faith. Jesus says
Therefore
tell you; whatever YOu ask in
prayer; believe that you have received it; and it will be yours
(Mark 11.24).
Some translations vary; but the Greek text actually says, "believe that you
have received iL:
Later scribes who copied the Greek manuscripts and some
later commentators have taken
[0 mean "believe that VOu will receive iL.
However; if we accept the text as it is in the earliest and best manuscripts
"believe that
have received it"
Jesus is apparently saying that when
ask for
something; the kind of faith that will bring results is
settled
assurance that when we prayed for
something
(or perhaps after we had been
praying over
period of time), God
grant our
request In

and that he may or may not give uS each time we pray This assured faith will
often come when
ask God for something and then quietly wait before him

him at his word and believe what he has said. This trust 0r dependence on
God
when it has an element of assurance Or confidence, is genuine biblical
faith:
Several other passages encourage US [O exercise faith when we pray
"Whatever You ask in prayer; YOu will receive_
if you have faith;
Jesus
teaches his disciples (Matt_ 21.22).
And James tells US we are t0
ask in faith;
with no doubting
(James 1.6).
wishful thinking
for it springs
from truSt in
personal God who wants US t0 take him at his word_
Obedience. Since prayer is
relationship with God as
person, anything in
lives that displeases him will be
hindrance
prayer: The psalmist says_
had cherished iniquity in my heart; the Lord would not have listened"
(Ps. 66.18) . Though "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination t0 the
LORD,
by contrast; "the prayer of the upright is his delight" (Prov 15.8).
Again we read that "the LORD
hears the prayer of the righteous" (Prov
15.29).
But God is not favorably disposed to those who reject his laws: "If
one turns away his ear from hearing the law; even his prayer is an
abomination
(Prov: 28.9).
The apostle Peter quotes Psalm 34 to affirm that
'the eyes of the Lord are
upon the righteous_
and his ears are open t0 their
prayer"
Peter 3.12). Since
the previous verses encourage
conduct in everyday life
speaking and
turning away from evil and
right; Peter is
that God readily hears
the prayers of those who live lives of obedience to him: Similarly, Peter warns
husbands to "live considerately
with their wives_
"in order that your prayers
may not be hindered" (1 Peter 3.7).
Likewise, John reminds uS of the need for
clear conscience before God when we pray; for he says
"If our' hearts do nOr
condemn uS
have confidence before God; and we receive from him
things
hope
Prayer_
never

saying -

him"
John 3.21-22).
Now this teaching must not be misunderstood. We do not need to be freed
from sin completely before God can be expected to answer 0ur prayers. If
God only answered the prayers of sinless people_
then no one in the whole
Bible except Jesus would have had his or her prayers answered. When
come before God through his grace, we come cleansed by the blood of Christ
(Rom: 3.25; 5.9; Eph: 2.13; Heb. 9.14;
Peter 1.2). Yet we must not neglect
the biblical emphasis on personal holiness of life_
Prayer and holy living g0
together: There is much grace in the Christian life, but growth in personal
holiness is also
route [0 much greater
blessing; and that is true with respect
tO prayer as well. The passages quoted teach that; all other
being equal,
more exact obedience will lead to increased effectiveness in prayer (cf: Heb
12.14; James 4.3-4).
Confession of Sins. Because our obedience t0 God is never perfect in this
life,
continually depend on his
forgiveness for our sins.
Confession of sins
is necessary in order for God t0
"forgive us'
in the sense of restoring his
by-day relationship with us (see Matt: 6.12;
John 1.9).
when

Sometimes when we

With respect to those sins that we do not remember or are
unaware of, it is appropriate tO pray the general prayer of David, "Clear me
from hidden faults
(Ps. 19.12).
Sometimes
confessing
sins t0 other trusted Christians will bring an
assurance of
veness and encouragement to overcome sin as well. James
relates mutual
confession t0 prayer; for in
passage discussing powerful
prayer; James encourages us, "Therefore confess your sins tO one another; and
pray for one another; that you may be healed
(James 5.16).
5. Forgiving Others: Jesus says_
"If you
forgive men their trespasses
YOuI
heavenly Father also will forgive you; but
you do not
forgive men their
trespasses, neither
your Father
forgive your trespasses"
(Matt. 6.14-15).
Similarly, Jesus says, "Whenever YOu stand praying; forgive, if you have
anything
any one; s0 that your Father also who is in heaven may
forgive YOu YOur trespasses'
(Mark 11.25). Our Lord does not have in mind
the initial experience of forgiveness we know when we are justified by faith;
for that would not
belong in
prayer that we pray every day (see Matt: 6.12
with wv. 14-15). He refers rather to the day-by-day relationship with God that
need
have restored when we have sinned and displeased him
In tact,

Jesus commands US t0 build into Our prayers

the same way that we have forgiven others who have harmed us (in the same

sense of

another person or
harboring any desire to harm
them):
"Forgive US our sins
also have forgiven those who sin against
(Matt_ 6.12, author
translation). If there are those whom we have not
forgiven when we pray this prayer; then we are
God not t0 restore
right relationship with us after we sin, in just the same way as we have
refused tO do s0 with others.
Since prayer presumes
relationship with God as
person
this is not
surprising: If we have sinned against him and
the Holy Spirit (cf: Eph:
4.30) , and the sin has not been forgiven, it interrupts Our relationship with
God (cf. Isa. 59.1-2). Until sin is forgiven and the relationship is restored
prayer will, of course, be difficult Moreover; if we have unforgiveness in Our
hearts against someone else, then we are not acting in a way that is pleasing
God or helpful to uS
So God declares (Matt: 6.12, 14-15) that he
distance himself from uS until we
forgive others.
Humility. James tells us that "God opposes the proud, but gives grace
the humble" (James 4.6; also
Peter 5.5). Therefore he
~Humble
yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt
(James 4:10). Humility is
thus the right attitude t0 have in
praying
God, whereas pride is altogether
inappropriate
Jesus' parable about the Pharisee and the tax collector illustrates this.
When
the Pharisee stood t0 pray; he was boastful:
God,
thank you that
am not
like other men, extortioners; unjust, adulterers, 01 even like this tax collector:
fast [wice
week,
give tithes of all that
get" (Luke 18.11-12). By contrast;
the humble tax collector
would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but bear
his breast, saying;
God_
sinner! '
(Luke 18.13). Jesus
said thar he
went down t0 his house justified,
rather than the Pharisee, "for
every one who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself
will be exalted" (Luke 18.14). This is why Jesus condemned those who "for
pretense make long prayers'
(Luke 20.47) and those hypocrites who "love t0
stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners_
that
may be
seen DY men
(Matt: 6.5).
God is rightly jealous for his own honor:
Therefore he is not pleased to
answer the prayers of the proud who take honor t0 themselves rather than
giving it to him. True humility before God, which will also be reflected in
genuine humility before others
is necessary for effective prayer:

Continuing in Prayer Over Time_
Just as Moses twice stayed on the
mountain forty days before God for the people of Israel
(Deut: 9.25-26;
10:10-11), and just as Jacob said to God,
not let you g0_

(Gen: 32.26), so we see in Jesus
life
pattemn of much time given
prayer: When
multitudes were
following him; "he himself was often
withdrawing into the wilderness regions and praying'
(Luke 5.16
author'$
translation)
At another time; "all night he continued in prayer to God"
(Luke 6.12).
Sometimes,
aS in the case of Moses and Jacob
prayer over
period of
time may be prayer for one specific item (cE Luke 18.1-8). When we are
earnestly seeking God for an answer to
specific prayer; we may in fact
repeat the same request several times.
Paul asked the Lord "three times'
Cor: 12.8) that his thorn in the flesh would be taken from him_
Jesus himself;
when he was in the
of Gethsemane; asked the Father; "Remove this
cup from me;
not whar
will, but what you
(Mark 14.36). Then after
he came and found the disciples sleeping; Jesus prayed again;
the
same request in the same words:
And again he went away and prayed, saying
the same
words"
(Mark 14.39). These are instances of eamest repetition in
prayer for
deeply felt need. They are not examples of what Jesus forbids
the
up of
empty phrases'
in the mistaken belief that
many words"
will eamn
(Matt: 6.7).
There
also an element of
continual fellowship with God in praying over
time.
Paul calls on US t0 "pray constantly" (1 Thess. 5.17), and he encourages
the Colossians
continue steadfastly in prayer; being watchful in it with
thanksgiving
(Col. 4.2). Such continual devotion tO prayer even while about
daily duties should characterize the life of every believer: The apostles are
telling example: They freed themselves from other responsibilities in order t0
give more time tO prayer:
But we
devole ourselves
prayer and t0 the
ministry of the word" (Acts 6.4).
Praying Earnestly: Jesus himself; who is our model for prayer; prayed
earnestly "In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications,
with loud cries and tears _
to him who was able t0 save him
death, and he
was heard for his
godly fear" (Heb. 5.7). In some of the prayers of Scripture
we can
almost hear the great intensity with which the saints pOur out their
hearts before God_
Daniel cries out; "0 LORD, hear!
LORD, forgive! 0
LORD, listen and take action! For Thine own sake,
0 my God, do not
because Thy city and Thy people are called by Thy name'
(Dan.
9.19 NASB)
When God shows Amos the judgment that he is going t0 bring on his people_

personal relationships, if we attempt t fake emotional intensity and
an outward show of emotion that is not consistent with the feelings of our
hearts_
others involved will usually sense our hypocrisy
once and be put off
by it. How much more is this true of God, who fully knows our hearts_
Therefore_
intensity and depth of emotionab
involvement in prayer should
never be faked: we cannot fool God. Yet; if we truly begin tO see situations as
God sees them; if we begin t0 see the needs of
hurting and dying world as
they really are_
then
will be natural t0 pray with intense emotional
involvement and to expect God_
merciful Father; tO respond to heartfelt
prayer: And where such intensely felt prayer finds expression in group prayer
meetings
Christians should certainly accept and be thankful for it, for it often
indicates
deep work of the
Spirit in the heart of the person praying_
On the Lord: After

David
says, "Wait for the LORD; be strong_-

"But for YOu_
0 LORD
wait;
You_
0 LORD my God, who will answer" (Ps. 38.15). The psalmist
likewise says,
wait for the LORD, my soul waits
and in his word
hope;
my soul waits for the LORD
more than watchmen for the morning

(Ps. 130.5-6)
from human experience may help us
appreciate the benefit of
waiting before the Lord for
response t0 prayer: If
wish to invite someone

various ways
can do s0. First;
can issue

invitation: "It would be nice to have You come

Margaret and
would really love t0 have
you come t0 dinner at our home this Friday at 6.00 p.m Could you come?"
and then, continuing to look him in the eye;
wait silently and patiently while
he decides what tO answer: He knows from my facial expression; my tone of
voice, my timing; and the setting in which
chose t0 talk to him that
am
putting my whole self into this request; and that
am
t0 him as a
person and a5
friend. Waiting patiently for an answer shows my earnestness,
my sense of expectancy, and my respect for him as
person This third kind
of request is like that of the earnest Christian who comes before God, gains
sense of being in his presence, earnestly pours out
request t0 him; and then
waits quietly for some sense of assurance of God $ answer:
This is not t0 say that all our requests must be of this nature,
01 even that the
first two kinds of requests are wrong: Indeed, in some situations we pray
quickly because we have little time before we need an answer (see Neh 2.4)-
And sometimes we do pray
generally because we do not have more
information about
situation, or because it is far removed from US 0r because
of shortness of time
But the material in Scripture 0n earnest prayer and on
waiting for the Lord
and the fact that prayer is personal communication
between ourselves and God_
do indicate that prayers such as the third kind of
request are much deeper and will undoubtedly bring many more answers from
God
Praying in Private_
DanieL
went to his upper chamber and
got down
upon his knees three times
day and prayed and gave thanks before his God"
(Dan: 6.10).
Jesus frequently went out into solitary places to be alone to
pray (Luke 5.16 et al.) And he also teaches us, "When you pray; g0 into your
room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your
Father who sees in secret will reward you'
(Matt_ 6.6). This statement is in
the context of avoiding the error of the hypocrites who loved t0 pray at the
street corners "that they may be seen by men
(Matt: 6.5). There is wisdom in
Jesus
encouragement [0 pray

hypocrisy; but also that we might not be distracted by the presence of other
people and therefore modify Our prayers t0 suit what we think
will
expect t0 hear: When we are truly alone with God, in the privacy of
room t0
which we have
shut the door" (Matt: 6.6) , then we can pour out Our hearts [0

him:
The need t0 pray in private may also have implications for small-group or
church prayer meetings: when believers come together to seek the Lord
eamestly about
matter; it is often helpful if they can be in the
privacy of
home where the door is shut and they can collectively cry Out to
God
Apparently this was the way the early Christians prayed when they were
making earnest supplication to God for the release of Peter from prison (see
Acts 12.5, 12-16).
Praying With Others:
Believers find strength in praying together with
others_
In fact, Jesus teaches uS,
say to YOu; if two of yOu agree on
earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in
heaven. For where [WO 0r three are
gathered in my name, there am
in the
midst of them" (Matt: 18.19-20).
There are many other examples in Scripture where groups of believers prayed
together
where one person led the entire
congregation in prayer (note
Solomon
prayer "in the presence of all the assembly of Israel" at the
dedication of the temple in
8.22-53 0r the prayer of the early church
in Jerusalem when
lifted their voices together to God" in Acts 4.24)
Even the Lord $ Prayer is put in the plural:
does not say,
Give me this
my daily bread" but "Give us this day our daily bread'
and
"Forgive US our
sins" and "Lead uS not into temptation but deliver us from evil" (Matt: 6.12-
13, author'=
translation).
with others, then, is also right and often
increases our faith and the effectiveness of our prayers.
Prayer
often connected with fasting in Scripture: Sometimes
these are occasions of intense supplication before God, as when Nehemiah, on
hearing of the ruin of Jerusalem,
continued fasting and praying before the
God of Heaven
(Neh: 1.4), or when the Jews learned of the decree of
Ahasuerus that they would all be killed, and "there was great mourning
among the Jews
with fasting and weeping and lamenting'
(Esth 4.3), 0r
when Daniel sought the LORD
prayer and supplications with fasting and
sackcloth and ashes'
(Dan. 9.3). At other times
is connected with
repentance_
for God says to the people who have sinned
him,
"Yet
even nOW,
says the LORD
return to me with all your heart; with fasting; with
weeping
and with mourning
(Joel 2.12).
In the New Testament, Anna was
worshiping with fasting and prayer night
and day'
(Luke 2.37) in the temple, and the church at Antioch was
'worshiping the Lord and fasting
when the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for

"by "
fasting
against L
Barnabas and Saul for the work to which
have called them
(Acts 13.2).
The church responded with further fasting and prayer before sending
Barnabas and Saul on their first missionary journey:
Then after fasting and
praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off
(Acts 13.3). In
fasting
routine
of seeking the Lord' $ guidance with
church officers_
for on Paul $ first missionary joumney;
read that he and
Barnabas, as they traveled back through the churches
had founded,
appointed elders for them in every church; with prayer and fasting" (Acts
14.23).
So fasting appropriately accompanied prayer in many situations: in times of
intensive intercession, repentance; worship, and
guidance. In each
of these situations, several benefits come from fasting; all of which affect
relationship to God: (1) Fasting increases Our sense of humility and
dependence on the Lord (for our
hunger and physical weakness continually
remind us how we are nOt really strong in ourselves but need the Lord)
Fasting allows US t0 give more attention to prayer (for we are not spending
time on
and (3) it is
continual reminder
just as we sacrifice
some
personal comfort to the Lord by not eating_
S0 we must continually
sacrifice all of ourselves
Moreover;
fasting is
exercise
self-discipline, for as we refrain from eating food, which we would ordinarily
desire_
it also strengthens our ability t0 refrain from sin, to which we might
otherwise be tempted t0
yield. If we train ourselves to accept the small
"suffering
willingly,
will be better able o accept other
suffering for the sake of righteousness (cf:
Heb. 5.8;
Peter 4.1-2). (5)
Fasting also heightens spiritual and mental alertness and
sense of God'$
presence aS we focus less 0n the material
of this world (such as food)
and as the energies of our body are freed from digesting and processing food
This enables Us t0 focus on eteral spiritual realities that are much more
important:
Finally; (6) fasting expresses earnestness and urgency in our
prayers: if we continued tO
eventually we would die. Therefore; in
symbolic way; fasting says to God that we are prepared to lay down our lives
that the situation be changed rather than that it continue. In this sense fasting
especially appropriate when the spiritual state of the church is low:
Yet even nOw;
says the LORD
retumn t0 me with all your heart;
with fasting; with weeping_
and with mourning;
and rend your hearts and not your garments_
(Joel 2.12-13a)

Though the New Testament does not specifically require that we
01 ser
special times when we must fast, Jesus certainly assumes that we will fast, for
he says t0 his disciples;
And when YOu fast" (Matt: 6.16). Moreover; Jesus
also says, "The
will come
when the
bridegroom is taken away from
them; and then they
fast" (Matt: 9.15). He is the
Bridegroom; we are his
disciples_
and during this present church age he has been "taken'
away from
uS until the
he returns. Most western Christians do nOr
if we
were
willing t0 fast more regularly
even for one 0r' tWO meals
might be
suiprised how much more spiritual power and strength
have in our
lives and in
churches.
What About Unanswered Prayer? We must begin by recognizing that as
as God is God and we are his creatures
there must be some unanswered
prayers. This is because God keeps hidden his own wise plans for the future,
and even though people pray; many events will not come about until the time
that God has decreed_
The Jews prayed for centuries for the Messiah to come;
and rightly 50, but
Wds
nor
"the time had fully come
that
God sent
forth his Son" (Gal. 4.4)
The souls of martyrs in heaven, free from sin, CrY
out for God to judge the earth (Rev: 6.10), but God does not immediately
answer; rather he tells them t0 rest
little longer (Rev: 6.11). It is clear that
there can be long periods of delay during which prayers go unanswered,
because the people praying do not know God $ wise timing
Prayer
also be unanswered because we do nOr always know how t0 pray
a5 we
ought (Rom: 8.26), we do not always pray according
God's
(James 4.3), and we do not always ask in faith (James 1.6-8).
And sometimes
think that one solution is best, but God has
better plan, even t0
purpose through suffering and hardship_
Joseph no doubt prayed eamnestly
be rescued from the pit and from
carried off into slavery in Egypt (Gen:
37.23-36), but many years later he found how in all of these events
God
meant it for
(Gen. 50.20).
When we face unanswered prayer; We
the company of Jesus, who prayed,
"Father; if You are
remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my
will, but yours, be done
(Luke 22.42). We join also the company of Paul,
who asked the Lord "three times'
that his thorn in the flesh be removed, but ic
was nOt; rather; the Lord told him,
My grace is sufficient for you; for my
power
made perfect
weakness
(2 Cor: 12.8-9).
We join the company of
David, who prayed for his son $ life t0 be saved, but it was nOt, so he "went
into the house of the LORD
and worshiped" and said of his son,
shall g0 to
him,
but he will nOt return t0 me
(2 Sam
12.20, 23). We join the company of

OUI cares 0n him,
knowing that he continually cares for uS ( 1 Peter 5.7). We
must keep remembering that he
give strength sufficient for each day
(Deut: 33.25) and that he has promised
will never fail yOu nor forsake
you"
(Heb
13.5; cf: Rom. 8.35-39).
We also must continue t0 pray: Sometimes an answer; long awaited, will
suddenly be given
was when Hannah after many years bore
child (1
Sam: 1.19-20) , or when Simeon saw with his Own eyes the
expected
Messiah come t0 the temple (Luke 2.25-35).
But sometimes prayers will remain unanswered in this life.
At times God will
answer those prayers after the believer dies_
At other times he will not; but
even then the faith expressed in those prayers and their heartfelt expressions
of love for God and the people he has made will still ascend as
pleasing
incense before God'$ throne (Rev 5.8; &.3
4) and will result in "praise and
glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ"
Peter 1:7).

Praise and
thanksgiving
t0 God
which will be treated more fully in chapter
51,are an essential element of prayer: The modeE
prayer that Jesus left us
begins with
word of praise: "Hallowed be your name'
(Matt_ 6.9). And Paul
tells the Philippians,
"in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving
your requests be made known to God" (Phil. 4.6), and the
Colossians_
Continue steadfastly in prayer; being watchful in it with
thanksgiving
(Col. 4.2). Thanksgiving;
every other aspect of prayer;
should not be
mechanical
mouthing of
'thank you" t0 God, but the
expression of words that reflect the thankfulness of our hearts. Moreover; we
should never think that thanking God for the answer to something we ask for
can somehow force God tO give it tO uS_
for that changes the prayer from
genuine, sincere request [0
demand that assumes
we can make God do what
we want him [0 do. Such
spirit in our prayers really denies the essential
nature of prayer as dependence on God
By contrast; the kind of thanksgiving that appropriately accompanies prayer
must express thankfulness to God for all circumstances, for every event of life

A place than all besides more sweet;

Tho' sundered far; by faith they meet
around the common Mercy Seat:
Ah, whither could we flee for aid

Or how the hosts of hell defeat;

Angels
What are
angels? Why did God create them?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
What Are Angels?
We may define angels as follows: Angels are created, spiritual
with
moral judgment and high intelligence_
but without physical bodies:
Created Spiritual Beings. Angels have not always existed; they are part of
the universe that God created_
passage that refers
angels as the "host"
of heaven (0r
armies of heaven'
Ezra says; "You are the LORD_
you alone-
YOu have made heaven, the heaven ot heavens_
all their host
and the
host of heaven worships
(Neh. 9.6; cf: Ps. 148.2 , 5). Paul tells uS that
God created all
visible and invisible
through Christ and for him_
and
then specifically includes the
angelic world with the phrase
whether thrones
dominions or principalities 0r authorities
(Col: 1.16).
That angels exercise moral judgement is seen in the fact that some of them
sinned and fell
their positions (2 Peter 2.4; Jude 6; see chapteL 20). Their
high intelligence is seen throughout Scripture as they speak to people (Matt
28.5; Acts 12.6-11; et al.) and sing praise to God (Rev: 4.11; 5.11).
Since angels are
spirits
(Heb. 1:14) 0r spiritual creatures_
they do not
ordinarily have physical bodies (Luke 24.39). Therefore they cannot usually
be seen by uS unless God gives uS
special ability t0 see them (Num: 22.31; 2
6.17; Luke 2:13). In their ordinary activities of guarding and protecting
us (Ps. 34.7; 91:11; Heb. 1:14), and joining with us in worship to God (Heb_
12.22), they are invisible. However; from time t0 time
took on
bodily
form to appear t0 various people in Scripture (Matt: 28.5; Heb_
13.2).
2. Other Names for Angels. Scripture sometimes uses other terms for angels
such as
sons of God" (Job 1.6; 2.1), "holy ones" (Ps. 89.5, 7),
spirits" (Heb_
1.14),
watchers" (Dan. 4.13,
17,23), "thrones_
dominions,
'principalities,
authorities" (Col. 1.16), and
powers
(Eph: 1.21).

Other Kinds of Heavenly
There are three other specific types of
heavenly beings named in Scripture: Whether we think of these as special
types of
angels
(in
broad sense of the term), 0r whether we think of them
as heavenly
distinct from
angels
they are nonetheless created spiritual
beings who serve and worship God_
The
Cherubim"
The cherubim were given the task of guarding the
entrance t0 the Garden of Eden (Gen: 3.24), and God himself is frequently
said to be enthroned on the cherubim or t0 travel with the cherubim as his
chariot (Ps_
18.10_
Ezek: 10.1-22). Over the ark of the covenant in the Old
Testament were [WO
figures of cherubim with their wings stretched out
above the ark, and it was there that God promised t0 come
dwell among his
people
There
will meet with YOu, and from above the mercy seat; from
between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of testimony;
will speak
with you of all that
will give YOu in commandment for the people of Israel"
(Ex. 25.22; cf:
18-21).
The
Seraphim"
Another group of heavenly
the seraphim; are
mentioned only in Isaiah 6.2
where they continually worship the Lord and
call t0 one
another; "Holy; holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is
full of his glory" (Isa. 6.3)
The Living Creatures: Both Ezekiel and Revelation tell uS of yet other
kinds of heavenly
known as
creatures
around God $ throne
(Ezek: 1.5-14; Rev: 4.6-8).
With their appearances like
lion, an OX
man;
and an eagle, they are the mightiest representatives of various
of God $
entire creation (wild beasts, domesticated animals_
human
and birds),
and they worship God continually: "Day and night
never cease t0
'Holy; holy, holy; is the Lord God Almighty; who was and is and is to
comel-
(Rev: 4.8)
Rank and Order Among the Angels. Scripture indicates that there is rank
and order among the angels
One angel, Michael, is called an "archangel" in
Jude 9,
title that indicates rule or authority over other
angels_
He is called
one of the chief princes'
in Daniel 10.13_
Michael also appears t0 be
leader
in the angelic army:
Now war arose
heaven, Michael and his angels
fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought; but
were defeated" (Rev: 12.7-8). And Paul tells us that the Lord will return from
heaven
with the archangel's call" (1 Thess. 4:16). Whether this refers to
Michael as the only archangel, Or whether there are other archangels,
Scripture does not tell us.

Names of Specific Angels: Only two angels are specifically named in
Scripture _
Michael is mentioned in Jude 9 and Revelation 12.7-8 as well as
in Daniel 10.13,21
where he is called "Michael, one of the chief princes"
13). The angel
Gabriel is mentioned
Daniel 8.16 and 9.21as
messenger
who comes from God to speak t0 Daniel. Gabriel is also identified as God' $
messenger t0 Zechariah and Mary in Luke 1: the angel answers Zechariah,
am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God" (Luke 1.19). Then we read,
the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to
city of Galilee
named Nazareth; t0
virgin
and the virgin'$ name
was Mary
(Luke 1.26
27).
Only One Place at One Time: Scripture frequently represents angels as
traveling from one place to another; as in the verse mentioned above where
Gabriel
was sent from God t0
city of Galilee named Nazareth" (Luke
1.26). This
made explicit when an angel comes to Daniel
and says:
have come because of your words. The prince of the kingdom of
Persia withstood me twenty-one
but Michael, one of the chief
princes
came
help me, so [ left him there with the prince of the
kingdom of Persia and came
make YOu understand what is to befall
your people in the latter
(Dan. 10.12-14)
The idea that an ange
can be in only one place at one time is consistent with
the fact that angels are created beings. Unlike God_
who is omnipresent, they
are finite creatures and therefore limited [0
in one place at one time_
is everything else that God has created_
7. How Many Angels Are There? Though Scripture does not give uUS
figure
for the number of
angels God created, it is apparently
very great number:
We read that God on Mount Sinai
came from the ten thousands of
ones,
with flaming fire at his right hand" (Deut 33.2). We also learn that; "the
chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands" (Ps_
68.17
NIV)
When we come t0 worship we come into the presence of "innumerable
angels" (Heb:
12.22)-
Their number
even more
strikingly emphasized in
Revelation 5.11_
where John says
heard around the throne and the living
creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads 0f
myriads and thousands of thousands_
expression indicates an amazingly
number (from
human standpoint)
an innumerable assembly of
beings praising God.
8. Do People Have Individual Guardian Angels? Scripture clearly tells uS
days;
days
being
holy:
This
large
angelic
that God sends
angels for our protection:
He will give his angels
yOu t0 guard YOu in all your ways. On their hands they will bear YOu Up, lest
you dash your foot against
stone
(Ps. 91.11-12). But some people have
gone beyond this idea of general protection and wondered if God gives
specific
guardian
for each individual in the world, or at least for each
Christian
Support for this idea has been found in Jesus' words about little
children, "in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is
in heaven'
(Matt: 18.10). However; our Lord may simply be
that
angels who are assigned the task of protecting little children have ready
access [0
God's presence. (To use an athletic analogy; the angels may be
playing
'zone
rather than
man-On-man
defense.
When the disciples in
Acts 12:15 say that Peter '$ "angel" must be knocking at the doOr; this does
not necessarily imply belief in an individual guardian angel. It could be that
an angel
was
guarding
caring for Peter just at that time_
There seems to be;
therefore; no convincing support for the idea of individual
guardian angels'
in the text of Scripture:
9. Angels Do Not Marry: Jesus taught that in the resurrection people
neither
marry
are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven"
(Matt: 22.30;
cf: Luke 20.34-36). This would suggest that angels do not have the kind of
family relationships that exist among human beings. Scripture is otherwise
silent on this point, so it is wise not [0 attempt to engage
speculation.
The Power of Angels_
Angels apparently have very great power: They are
called
you mighty ones who do his word" (Ps_
103.20) and
powers
(cf:
Eph: 1.21) and "dominions
and
authorities'
Col: 1:16). Angels are
seemingly
greater in might and power" than rebellious human
Peter 2.11; cf. Matt: 28.2). At least for the time of their earthly existence,
human
are made "lower than the
angels" (Heb. 2.7). Though the power
of angels is great; it is certainly not infinite, but it is used to battle against the
evil demonic powers under the control of Satan (Dan: 10.13; Rev: 12.7-8;
20.1-3).
Nonetheless, when the Lord retums

position
higher than that of
(1 Cor: 6.3; see section C A; below)
Who Is the Angel of the Lord? Several passages of Scripture, especially
in the Old Testament; speak of the angel of the Lord in
way that suggests
that he is God himself

various
people in the Old Testament:
In some passages "the angel of the LORD

angel
in the wilderness promises her;
will s0
greatly multiply your descendants
that they cannot be numbered for multitude" (Gen. 16.10) , and
responds by calling "the name of the LORD who spoke to her;
You are
God
(Gen: 16.13). Similarly; when Abraham
about [0 sacrifice his
son Isaac, "the angel of the LORD" calls to him from heaven and says
Now
know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only
son, from me
(Gen: 22.12). When
the angel of God" appeared to Jacob in
dream; he said,
am the God of Bethel, where you anointed
pillar and
made
vow [0 me'
(Gen. 31:11, 13). Again_
when
angel of the LORD
appeared to Moses in_
flame of fire out of the midst of _
bush; he then said_
"Tam the God of your father; the God of Abraham
the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob" (Ex: 3.2, 6). These are clear instances of the angel of the Lord
the angebe
of God appearing as God himself, perhaps more specifically as
God the
taking on
human body for
short time in order to appear to
human
At other times the angel of the Lord seems to be distinguished from God (see
2 Sam 24.16-
Ps. 34.7; Zech: 1.11-13), and passages that mention
'an angel
of the Lord"
Luke 1:11) usually indicate an ange
sent by God.
hen Wer AEER Lreated:
All the angels must have been created before the seventh day of creation, for
we read, "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them" (Gen. 2.13
understanding "host" to be the heavenly creatures that
inhabit God s universe). Even more explicit than this is the statement, "In six
the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea
and all that is in them, and
rested the seventh day" (Ex. 20:11) Therefore all the angels were created at
least by the sixth day of creation.
But can we be any more
specific? There may be
hint at the creation of
angelic
on the first
of creation when we read that "in the
beginning
God created the heavens and the
(Gen.
1:1), and then immediately after
we read that "the

mention of the heavens in this second verse_
This may suggest that the
uninhabitable state of the earth is contrasted with the heavens where; perhaps_
God had already created
beings and assigned them various roles and
orders_
This idea is made more plausible when we read that "the morning
stars sang together; and all the sons of God shouted for joy" at the time when
God laid the

Angels Show the Greatness of God'$ Love and Plan for Us.
Human
beings and angels (using the term broadly) are the only moral, highly
intelligent creatures that God has made_
[herefore we can understand much
about God s plan and love for US when we compare ourselves with
angels.
The first distinction t0 be noted is that angels are never said to be made "in
the image of God_
while human
are several times said t0 be in God' $
image (Gen.
1.26-27; 9.6). Since
in the image of God means to be like
God
it seems fair t0 conclude that we are more like God even than the
angels are
This
supported by the fact that God will someday give us authority over
angels_
[O judge them: "Do you not know that we are
judge
Cor: 6.3). Though we are "for
little while lower than the
angels'
(Heb. 2.7),
when our salvation is complete
will be exalted above angels and rule over
them. In fact; even nOW; angels already serve uS:
Are they not all ministering
sent forth to serve_
for the sake of those who are
obtain salvation?"
(Heb. 1.14).
The ability of human beings to bear children like themselves (Adam
became
the father of
son in his own likeness, after his image_
Gen: 5.3) is another
element of our superiority to angels_
who apparently cannot bear children (cf:
Matt_ 22.30; Luke 20.34-36).
Angels also demonstrate the greatness of God's love for us in
though
many angels sinned
none were saved_
Peter tells us that

that;

that "the angels that did not keep their own position but left their proper
dwelling have been
by him in eternal chains in the nether gloom until the
judgment of the great day" (Jude 6).
And we read in Hebrews
surely it
is not with angels that he
concered but with the descendants of Abraham"
(Heb. 2.16).
We see, therefore, that God created two groups of intelligent, moral
creatures
Among the angels_

but God decided [0 redeem none of them:
This was perfectly just for God to do_
and no angeE
can ever complain that he
has been treated unfairly by God
Now among the other group of moral creatures

with the
angels that sinned: God could have let all of us go 0n our self-chosen
path toward eternal condemnation. Had God decided t0 save nO one out of the
entire sinful human race
he would be perfectly just to do s0, and no one could
complain of unfairness on his part:
But God decided t0 do much more than merely meet the demands of justice.
He decided t0 save some sinful human
If he had decided to save only
five human beings Out of the entire human race, that would have been much
more than justice: it would have been
demonstration of mercy and
grace. If he had decided to save only one hundred out of the whole human
race
would have been an amazing demonstration of mercy and love:
But
God in fact has chosen t0 do much more than that. He has decided t0 redeem
out of sinful mankind
great multitude, whom no man can number;
every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
(Rev: 5.9). This
incalculable
mercy and love_
far beyond our comprehension. It is all undeserved favor: it is
all of grace_
The
striking contrast with the fate of angels brings this truth
home
The fact that we have been saved from
life of rebellion against God means
that we are able t0
songs that angels will never be able to sing for all
etemity.

2. Angels Remind Us That the Unseen World Is Real. Just as the
Sadducees in Jesus' day said that "there is no resurrection; nor
angel; nor
spirit" (Acts 23.8) , s0 many in our day
the reality of
anything
cannot see_
But the biblical teaching on the existence of angels is
constant
reminder t0 us that there is an unseen world that is very real. It was only when
the Lord opened the eyes of Elisha'$ servant t0 the reality of this invisible
world that the servant saw that "the mountain was full of horses and chariots
of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6.17; this was
ary sent
Dothan to protect Elisha from the Syrians) The psalmist; too, shows an
awareness of the unseen world when he encourages the
angels
"Praise him,
all his angels, praise him; all his host! " (Ps. 148.2). The author of Hebrews
reminds US that when we
worship
we come inLO the
heavenly Jerusalem to
gather with "innumerable angels in festal gathering" (Heb 12.22), whom we
do not see_
but whose presence should fill us
both awe and joy: An
unbelieving world may dismiss talk of angels a5 mere superstition, but
Scripture offers
as insight into the state of affairs as
really are.
3. Angels Are Examples for Us: In both their obedience and their worship
angels provide helpful examples for us tO imitate. Jesus teaches US
pray;
"Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt: 6.10). In heaven God $
will is done by angels, immediately joyfully, and without question: We are t0
pray daily that our obedience and the obedience of others would be like that
of the
angels in heaven_
Their delight is to be God's humble servants, each
faithfully and joyfully performing their assigned tasks
whether great or small
Our desire and prayer should be that we ourselves and all others on earth

Angels Carry Out Some of God's Plans. Scripture sees angels as God s
servants who carry out some of his plans in the earth. They

22; 27.23-24)
cany out some of God $ judgments, bringing
plague upon Israel (2 Sam:
24.16-17) , smiting the leaders of the Assyrian army (2 Chron. 32.21) , striking
Herod dead because he did not give God glory (Acts 12.23), or pouring
out bowls of God
wrath on the earth (Rev: 16.1)
When Christ returns
angels
come with him as
army
accompanying their King and Lord
(Matt: 16.27; Luke 9.26;
Thess: 1.7).
Angels also patrol the
as God $ representatives (Zech: 1.10-Hl) and
cany out war against demonic forces (Dan 10.13; Rev: 12:7-8). John in his
vision saw an angel coming down from heaven, and he records that the angel
seized the dragon_

Angels Directly Glorify God. Angels also serve another function: they
minister directly t0 God by glorifying him. Thus_
in addition t0 human
there are other

creatures Who
glorify God in the universe:
Angels glorify God for who he is in himself; for his excellence:

(Ps. 103.20; cf:
48.2)
The seraphim continually praise God for his holiness (Isa. 6.2-3), as do the
four living creatures (Rev 4.8).
Angels also glorify God for his great plan of salvation a5
see it unfold:
When Christ was born in Bethlehem;
multitude of angels praised God and
said, "Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace among men with whom
he is pleasedl" (Luke 2.14; cf: Heb: 1.6). Jesus tells uS,
There is joy before

angels of God over one sinner who repents'
(Luke 15.10),
indicating that
angels rejoice every time someone turns from his or her sins and trusts in

Christ as Savior:
When Paul proclaims the gospel so that people from diverse racial
backgrounds, both Jews and Greeks_
are brought into the church; he sees
God'
wise plan for the church as
displayed before the angels (and
demons), for he says that he was called t0 preach to the Gentiles "that through
the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known t0 the
principalities and powers in the heavenly places
(Eph: 310). And Peter tells
uS thal
angels long to look"
Peter 1:12) into the glories of the plan of
salvation as
works out in the lives of individual believers each day:
Paul
also notes thar Christ was
seen
by angels" (1 Tim. 3.16), suggesting that they
glorified God for Christ's life of obedience_
Moreover; the tact that
omen
were tO have clothing that appropriately signaled that they were women,
"because of the angels'
(1 Cor: 11:10) , when the church assembled for
worship
indicates that .
angels witness the lives of Christians and glorify God
for our worship and obedience. Indeed, Paul reminds Timothy; when he wants
to emphasize the seriousness of
command, that our actions are carried Out in
the presence of
angelic witnesses: "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus
and of the elect angels
charge YOu t0 keep these rules without favor; doing
nothing from partiality'
Tim. 5.21; cf:
Cor: 4.9). If Timothy follows

We Should Be Aware of Angels in Our Daily Lives. Scripture makes it
clear that God wants US t0 be aware of the existence of
angels and of the
nature of their activity We should not therefore assume that its teaching about
angels has nothing whatsoever to do with
today Rather; there are
several ways in which our Christian lives will be enriched by an awareness of
the existence and ministry of angels in the world even today:
When
come before God in worship
we are joining not only with the great
company of believers who have died and come into God's presence in heaven,
"the spirits of just men made perfect;
but also with
great throng of angels_
"innumerable angels in festal gathering
(Heb. 12.22-23). Though we do not
ordinarily see or hear evidence of this heavenly worship; it certainly enriches
ouI sense of reverence and joy in God $ presence if we
appreciate the fact that
angels join us in the worship of God_
Moreover; we should be aware that
angels are watching`
obedience 0r
disobedience t0 God
through the day: Even if we think our sins are done in
being
obey,
grieved,
Uives
our
secret and
bring
[0 n0 one else;
should be sobered by the thought that
perhaps even hundreds of angels witness our disobedience and are grieved_
On the other hand, when we are discouraged and think that our faithful
obedience to God is witnessed by no one and is an encouragement t0 no one;
we can be comforted by the realization that perhaps hundreds of angels
witness our lonely struggle, daily "longing to look" at the way Christ $ great
salvation finds expression in our lives:
As if to make the reality of angelic observation of our service t0 God more
vivid, the author of Hebrews suggests that angels can sometimes take human
form; apparently to make "inspection visits_
something like the newspaper"
restaurant critic who disguises himself and visits
new restaurant: We read
"Do not neglect to show hospitality
strangers
for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares" (Heb. 13.2; cf: Gen. 18.2-5; 19.1-3). This
should make us eager to minister tO the needs of others whom we do not
know; all the while wondering if someday we will reach heaven and meet the
ange
whom we helped when he appeared temporarily as
human
distress here on earth:
When we are suddenly delivered from
danger Or distress,
might suspect
that
angels have been sent by God to help us_
and we should be thankful: An
ange
shut the mouths of the lions so
would not hurt Daniel
(Dan: 6.22),
delivered the apostles from prison (Acts 5.19-20), later delivered Peter from
prison (Acts 12.7-11) , and ministered to Jesus in the wilderness at =
time of
great weakness, immediately after his temprations had ended (Matt 411).
When

when we suddenly find footing

Does not Scripture promise,
For he will give his angels

lest you dash your foot against

(Ps. 91.11-12)? Should we not
therefore thank God for sending angels to protect Us at such times?
seems
right that we should do s0.
Cautions Regarding Our Relationship to Angels_
Beware of Receiving False Doctrine
Angels: The Bible warns
receiving false doctrine from supposed angels: "But even if we;
0r an
angel from heaven_
should preach to you
gospel
contrary t0 that which we
preached to you; let him be accursed" (Gal. 1.8). Paul makes this warning
because he knows that there is
possibility of deception. He says, "Even
gtief

From
against_
Satan disguises himself as an angel of light" (2 Cor: 11:14). Similarly; the
lying prophet who deceived the man of God in
13 claimed
An angel
spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying
Bring him back with yOu into
your house that he may eat bread and drink water'
13.18) . Yet the
text of Scripture immediately adds in the same verse; "But he lied to him:
These are all instances of false doctrine 0r
guidance being conveyed by
angels_
It is interesting that these examples show the clear possibility of
satanic deception tempting 4S
disobey the clear teachings of Scripture or
the clear commands of God (cf:
Kings 13.9). These warnings should keep
any Christians from being fooled by the claims of Mormons, for example; that
an angel
(Moroni)
to Joseph Smith and revealed to him the basis of the
Mormon religion. Such "revelation" is contrary t0 the teachings of Scripture
at many points (with respect t0 such doctrines as the
Trinity; the person of
Christ; justification by faith alone; and many others), and Christians should be
wared against accepting these claims.
The closing of the canon of
Scripture (see chapreL 3) should also warn us that no further revelation of
doctrine is to be given by God today; and any claims tO have received
additional revelation of doctrine from angels today should be immediately
rejected as talse:.
Do Not Worship Angels_
to Then, 0r Seek 'Them:
Worship of
angels
(Col. 2:18) was one of the false doctrines being taught at Colossae_
Moreover;
angel speaking
John in the book of Revelation warns John
not tO worship him: "You must not do that!
am
fellow servant with you
and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus_
Worship God" (Rev:
19.10).
Nor should we pray to angels:
We are
pray only to God_
who alone
omnipotent and thus able t0 answer prayer and who alone is omniscient and
therefore able to hear the prayers of all his people at once: By virtue of
omnipotence and omniscience_
God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are also
worthy of being prayed tO, but this
not true of any other
being: Paul warns
against thinking that any other "mediator" can come between us and God,
for there
one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus'
Tim: 2.5) . If we were t0 pray t0 angels
it would be
implicitly attributing t0 them
status equal t0 God, which we muSt nOt do.
There is no example in Scripture of anyone praying
any
specific angel
asking angels for help_
Moreover; Scripture gives US no warrant to seek for appearances of angels to

people apparently never sought those appearances

rather t0 talk t0

However; it
would nOt seem wrong
ask God to fulfill his promise in Psalm 91:11 t0
send angels t0 protect us in times of need:
Do Angels Appear to People Today? In the earliest period of the church's
history angels were active.
An angel told Philip tO travel
south on
road that
goes from Jerusalem to Gaza
Acts 8.26), instructed Cornelius to send
messenger t0 get Peter to come from Joppa (Acts 10.3-6), urged Peter tO get
up and walk out of the prison (Acts 12.6-11), and promised Paul that no one
on his ship would be
ost and that he himself would stand before Caesar (Acts
27.23-24). Moreover; the author of Hebrews encourages his readers, none of
whom are apostles
even first-generation believers associated with the
apostles (see Heb: 2.3), that they should continue
show hospitality
strangers, apparently with the expectation that
too might sometime
entertain
angels without realizing
(Heb
13.2).
There seems, therefore, no compelling reason
rule out the
possibility of
angelic appearances
Some would dispute this on the grounds that the
sufficiency of Scripture (see chapter 8) and the closing of its canon (see
chapter_3) rule out the possibility of angelic manifestations nOw_
would say that we are
nOnO
expect God
communicate
through angel
However; this conclusion does not follow: Though
would not add t0
the doctrinal and moral content of Scripture
God could communicale
information t0 us through
angels as he also does through prophecy
through ordinary communication from other persons
through
observation of the world. If God can send another human being t0 warn uS of
danger
encourage US when we are downcast; there seems no inherent
reason why he could not occasionally send an
angel to do this as well
However; we should use extreme caution in receiving guidance from an angel
should such an unusuab
event
happen. (It is perhaps noteworthy that very few
instances of such events are recorded today; and many of these involve the
communication of antiscripturab
doctrine; indicating that they are actually
demonic appearances
The fact that demons can appear as
angels of light (see
Cor: 11:14) should warn us that the appearance of any

does not guarantee that this being speaks truthfully: Scripture is Our guide;

Chapter 20
Satan and Demons
How should Christians think of Satan and demons today?
Spiritual warfare:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The previous chapter leads naturally tO
consideration of Satan and demons_
since they are evil angels who once were like the good angels but who sinned
and lost their
privilege of
God:
Like
angels,
are also created,
spiritua_
with moral judgment and high intelligence but without
physical bodies_
We may define demons as follows: Demons are evil angels
who sinned against God and who now continually work evil in the world.
Tl Uricin
When God created the world_
'saw everything that he had made, and
behold, it was
good" (Gen: 1.31). This means that even the
world
that God had created did not have evil
angels
demons in it at that time
Buc
by the time of Genesis
we find thar Satan; in the form of
serpent, was
tempting Eve to sin (Gen. 3.1-5). Therefore, sometime between the events of
Genesis 1.31 and Genesis 3.1,
there must have been
rebellion
the
world with many
angels turning against God and becoming evil.
The New Testament speaks of this in two places_
Peter tells uS,
did not
spare the angels when
sinned
but cast them into hell and committed
them to pits of nether gloom to be kept until the judgment" (2 Peter 2.4).
Jude also says that "the angels that did not keep their own position but left
their proper
dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nether
gloom until the judgment of the great day" (Jude 6). Once again the emphasis
is on the fact that they
removed from the glory of God $ presence and their
activity is restricted (metaphorically, they are in
'eternal
chains
bur the text
does not imply either that the influence of demons has been removed from the
world
that some demons are kepr in
place of punishment apart from the
world while others are able t0 influence iL
Rather; both
Peter and Jude tell

us that some angels rebelled against God and became hostile opponents t0 his
Word Their sin seems to have been pride
refusal to accept their assigned
place
tor they
did not keep their Own position but left their proper dwelling
(Jude 6).
It is also possible that there is
reference t0 the fall of Satan, the prince of
demons_
in Isaiah 14. As Isaiah is describing the judgment of God on the
of Babylon (an earthly; human king), he then comes to
section where he
begins

will sit on the mount of assembly
in the far north;
will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
will make myself like the Most High:
But you are brought down to Sheol,
to the depths of the Pit. (Isa. 14.12-15)
This language of ascending to heaven and
his throne on high and
saying;
will make
like the Most High" strongly suggests
rebellion
by an angelic creature of great pOwer and dignity. It would not be uncommon
for Hebrew prophetic speech t0 pass from descriptions of human events to
king
king;
Star,
setting '
myself E
descriptions of heavenly events that are parallel to them and that the earthly
events picture in
limited way - If this is so
then the sin of Satan is described
as one of pride and
attempting
to be equal to God in status and authority:
However;
is unlikely that Genesis 6.2-4 refers tO the fall of demons_
these verses
are told that "the sons of God saw that the daughters of men
were fair; and they took to wife such of them as
chose.
The Nephilim
were 0n the earth
those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God
came in t0 the daughters of men; and they bore children to them
Although
some have thought that the
'sons of God" in this passage are
angels who
sinned by manying human women, this is not
likely interpretation, for the
following reasons_
Angels are nonmateriak
and
according -
to Jesus do not marry (Matt:
22.30), facts that cast doubt on the idea that
the sons of God" are
who
married human wives_
Moreover;
nothing in the context of Genesis 6 itself
indicates thar the
sons of God" should be understood as
angels (this makes
this passage unlike Job 1-2, for example;
where the context of
heavenly
council makes it clear t0 the reader that angels are being referred t0) It is far
more
likely that the phrase
sons of God" here (as in Deut: 14.1) refers tO
people belonging
God and, like God, walking in righteousness (note Gen
4.26 as an introduction
Gen.
marking the beginning of Seth' s line at the
same time as "men began to call upon the name of the LORD
In fact; there is
an emphasis on sonship as including likeness to one
father in Genesis 5.3.
Moreover; the text traces the descendants from God through Adam and Seth
many
sons
in all of chapter
The
purpose of the narrative seems
to be to trace the parallel development of the godly (ultimately messianic) line
of Seth and the ungodly descendants of the rest of mankind. Therefore, the
sons of God" in Genesis 6.2 are men who are righteous in their imitation of
the character of their heavenly Father; and the "daughters of men'
are the
ungodly wives whom they marry:
Satin
Head oi the Demon:
Satan" is the personal name of the head of the demons. This name is
mentioned in Job 16, where "the sons of God came t0 present themselves
before the LORD
and Satan also came among them'
(see also Job 1.7-2.7).
Here he appears as the enemy of the Lord who
severe temptations
against Job. Similarly, near the end of David's life _
Satan stood up
against
Israel, and incited David [0 number Israel"
Chron: 21:1). Moreover;
Lechariah saw
vision of
Joshua the high priest
before the
angel of
the LORD
and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him" (Zech: 3.1).

The name
Satan" is
Hebrew word (satan) that means
adversary:
The
New 'lestament also uses the name
Satan;
simply taking
over trom the
Old Testament: So Jesus
in his temptation in the wilderness,
Satan
directly saying; "Begone
Satan!" (Matt: 4.10), or
saw Satan fall like
lightning from heaven
(Luke 10.18).
The Bible uses other names for Satan as well. He is called "the
(only
in the New Testament: Matt: 4.1; 13.39; 25.41; Rev: 12.9; 20.2; et al.), "the
serpent" (Gen. 3.1, 14;
Cor: 11.3; Rev: 12.9; 20.2), "Be-elzebul" (Matt:
10.25; 12.24,27; Luke 11.15), "the ruler of this world" (John 12.31; 14.30;
16.11),
prince of the power of the air" (Eph. 2.2), or "the evil one'
(Matt: 13.19;
John 2.13). When Jesus says [0 Peter;
Get behind me; Satan!
You are
hindrance t0 me; for yOu are not on the side of God, but of men'
(Matt: 16.23), he recognizes that Peter'$ attempt to keep him from suffering
and dying on the cross is really an attempt to keep him from obedience to the
Father' =
plan. Jesus realizes that opposition ultimately comes not from Peter;
but from Satan himself:
Hea dny
emnn
Satan Was the Originator of Sin. Satan sinned before any human
did so_
as is evident from the fact that he (in the form of the serpent) tempted
Eve (Gen: 31-6; 2 Cor: 11.3). The New Testament also informs uS that Satan
was
murderer from the beginning
and is
liar and the father of lies
(John 8.44). It also says that "the devil has sinned from the beginning
John 3.8). In both of these texts, the phrase "from the beginning" does not
imply that Satan was
from the time God began t0 create the world
from
the beginning of the world"
0r from the
beginning of his existence
from the
beginning of his life
but rather from the "beginning
parts of the history of
the world (Genesis 3 and even before) The devil's characteristic has been t0
originate sin and tempt others t0 sin
2. Demons Oppose and Try to Destroy Every Work of God. Just as Satan
tempted Eve t0 sin against God (Gen: 3.1-6), so he tried t0 get Jesus
sin
and thus fail in his mission as Messiah (Matt: 4:1-11). The tactics of Satan
and his demons are t0 use lies (John &.44), deception (Rev: 12.9) , murder (Ps.
106.37; John 8.44) , and every other kind of destructive activity t0 attempt to
cause people t0 turn away from God and destroy themselves:
Demons will
every tactic t0 blind people to the gospel (2 Cor: 4.4) and
them in
bondage t0 things that hinder them from coming t0 God (Gal. 4.8). They will
also try t0 use temptation, doubt, guilt; fear; confusion, sickness, envy, pride;
speaks

"the

slander; or any other means
possible to hinder
Christian $ witness and
usefulness
3. Yet Demons Are Limited by God' s Control and Have Limited Power:
The story of Job makes it clear that Satan could only do what God gave him
permission t0 do and nothing more (Job 1:12; 2.6). Demons are kept in
eternal chains
(Jude 6) and can be successfully resisted by Christians
through the authority that Christ gives them (James 4.7)
Moreover; the power of demons is limited. After rebelling against God they
do not have the power they had when
were
angels; for sin is
weakening
and destructive influence_
The power of demons, though significant; is
therefore probably less than the power of angels_
In the area of knowledge, we should not think that demons can know the
future or that they can read our minds or know our thoughts. In many places
in the Old Testament; the Lord shows himself to be the true God in distinction
from the false (demonic)
of the nations by the fact that he alone can
know the future:
am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from
the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done
(Isa. 46.9-10).
Even
angels do not know the time of Jesus' return (Mark 13.32) , and there is
no indication
Scripture that they or demons know anything else about the
future either:
With respect t0 knowing our thoughts, the Bible tells US that Jesus knew
people
thoughts (Matt. 9.4; 12.25; Mark 2.8; Luke 6.8; 11:17) and that God
knows people
thoughts (Gen. 6.5; Ps. 139.2, 4,23; Isa. 66.18) , but there is
indication that angels or demons can know our
thoughts. In
Daniel
told King Nebuchadnezzar that no one speaking by any other power than the
God of heaven could tell the king what he had dreamed:
DanieL
answered the
"No wise men, enchanters, magicians; or
astrologers can show to the
the mystery which the

asked;
but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries_
and he has
made known [0
Vebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days
Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are
these_
(Dan. 2.27-28)
But
demons cannot read people's minds_
how shall we understand
contemporary reports of witch doctors, fortune-tellers,
other people
evidently under demonic influence who are able tO tell people accurate details

King
of their lives which
thought no one knew; such as (for example) what
food they had for breakfast; where they keep some hidden money in their
house; etc.? Most of these things can be explained by realizing that demons
can observe what goes On in the world and can probably draw some
conclusions from those observations.

Christians should not be led astray if
encounter members of the occult or
of other false religions who seem t0 demonstrate such unusual knowledge
from time t0 time. These results of observation do not prove that demons can
read 0uI thoughts_
however; and
in the Bible would lead us t0 think
they have that power:
There Have Been Differing Stages of Demonic Activity in the History
of Redemption:
In the Old Testament: Because in the Old Testament the word demon is
often used, it might at first seem that there is little indication of demonic
activity: However; the people of Israel often sinned by serving false
and
when we realize that these false
gods
were really demonic forces_
we see
that there
bit of Old Testament material referring to demons. This
identification of false
demons
made explicit; for example; when
Moses says
They stirred him [God] t0 jealousy with strange gods;
with abominable practices
provoked him t0 anger:
They sacrificed t0 demons which were no
they had never known:=
(Deut: 32.16-17)
Moreover; in reflecting on the horrible practice of child sacrifice; which the
[sraelites imitated from the pagan nations_
the psalmist says;
They mingled with the nations
and learned t0 do as
did.
They served their idols,
which became

they
they
nothing

They sacrificed their sons
and their daughters tO the demons
(Ps. 106.35-37)
These references demonstrate that the worship offered to idols in all the
nations
surrounding Israel was really worship of Satan and his demons_
This
is why Paul can say of the false religions of the first-century Mediterranean
world, "What pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God" (1 Cor:
10.20). It is thus fair to conclude that all the nations around Israel that
practiced idol worship were engaging in the worship of demons. The battles
the [sraelites
fought against pagan nations were battles against nations who
Were
controlled by demonic forces and thus "in the power of the evil one
(cf:
John 5.19). They were as much spirituab
battles as
physicak
battles: the
people of Israel needed to depend on God'$ power to help them in the
spiritual realm as much as in the physical:
In light of this, it is significant that there is no clear instance of the casting out
of demons in the Old Testament: The nearest analogy is the case of David
playing the lyre for
Saul:
And whenever the evil spirit from God was
upon Saul; David took the lyre and played it with his hand; s0 Saul was
refreshed, and was well, and the evil
departed
him"
(1 Sam:
16.23). However; Scripture speaks of this as
recuring event
whenever" )
indicating that the evil spirit returned after David left Saul. This was nOt the
completely effective triumph over evil spirits that we find in the New
Testament
Consistent with the purpose of Satan to destroy all the good works of God_
pagan worship of demonic idols was characterized by destructive practices
such as the sacrifice of children (Ps. 106.35
inflicting bodily harm on
oneself (1
18.28; cf: Deut: 14.1) , and cult prostitution as
part of pagan
worship (Deut: 23.17;
Kings 14.24; Hos. 4:14).
Worship of demons will
regularly lead to immoral and self-destructive practices_
the Ministry of Jesus: After hundreds of years of inability to have
any effective triumph over demonic forces_
it is understandable that when
Jesus came casting out demons with absolute authority, the people were
amazed:
And
were all amazed, s0 thar
questioned among
themselves, saying

With authority he
commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him'
(Mark 1.27). Such
power over demonic forces had never before been seen in the history of the
world:

Jesus explains that his power over demons is

ministry tO inaugurate the reign of the kingdom of God among mankind in a
new and powerful way:

man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong
man? Then indeed he may plunder his house_
(Matt. 12.28-29)
The
strong man" is Satan, and Jesus had bound him, probably at the time of
his triumph over him in the temptation in the wilderness (Matt 41-11).
his earthly ministry; Jesus had entered the strong man $
house'
(the
world of unbelievers who are under the bondage of Satan); and he was
plundering his house, that is, freeing people from satanic bondage and
bringing them into the joy of the kingdom of God: It was "by the Spirit of
God" that Jesus did this; the new power of the Holy Spirit
to triumph
over demons was evidence that in the ministry of Jesus "the kingdom of God
has come upon you:
the New Covenant Age: This authority over demonic powers was
not limited t0 Jesus himself; for he
similar authority first t0 the Twelve
(Matt: 10.8; Mark 3.15), and then to seventy disciples_
After
period of
ministry; the seventy "retumed with joy; saying_
Lord
even the demons are
subject t0 US in your namel'
(Luke 10.17). Then Jesus responded,
S0t
Satan fall like lightning from heaven'
(Luke 10:18) , indicating again _
distinctive triumph over Satan'$ power (once again, this was probably at the
time of Jesus' victory in the temptation in the wilderness, but Scripture does
not explicitly specify that time)
Authority over unclean spirits later
extended beyond the seventy disciples t0 those
the early church who
ministered in Jesus' name (Acts &.7; 16.18; James 4.7;
5.8-9),
fact
consistent with the idea that ministry in Jesus
name in the new covenant age
is characterized by triumph over the powers of the devil (1 John 3.8).
d. During the Millennium: During the millennium; the future thousand-year
reign of Christ on earth mentioned in Revelation 20,
the activity of Satan
and demons will be further restricted. Using language that suggests
much
greater restriction of Satan '$ activity than we see today; John describes his
vision of the beginning of the millennium as follows:
Then
saw an angel coming down from heaven,
in his hand
the key of the bottomless pit and
great chain. And he seized the
dragon, that ancient serpent; Who is the Devil and Satan, and bound

gave
Peter -

him for
thousand years, and threw him into the pit; and shut
and
sealed
over him; that he should deceive the nations no more, till the
thousand years were ended
After that he must be loosed for
little
while: (Rev: 20:1-3)
Here Satan is described as completely deprived of any ability t0 influence the
earth. During the millennium; however; there will still be sin in the hearts of
the unbelievers, which will grow until the end of the thousand years when
there
large-scale rebellion against Christ; led by Satan who, having
been
oosed from his prison
(Rev 20.7) , will come to lead that rebellion
(Rev: 20.8-9). The fact that sin and rebelliousness persist in people'
hearts
apart from the activity of Satan, even
the thousand-year reign of
Christ; shows that we cannot blame all sin in the world on Satan and his
demons_
Even when Satan is without influence in the world, sin will remain
and be
problem in people
hearts .
At the Final
Judgment: At the end of the millennium, when Satan is
loosed and gathers the nations for battle, he will be decisively defeated and
"thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur"' and "tormented
and night for
ever and ever'
(Rev: 20.10). Then the judgment of Satan and his demons will
be complete.
Our Relationthin
Demons
1. Are Demons Active in the World Today? Some people, influenced by
naturalistic worldview that only admits the reality of what can be seen Or
touched
heard_
that demons exist today and maintain that belief in
their reality reflects an obsolete worldview taught in the Bible and other
ancient cultures. For example_
the German New Testament scholar Rudolf
Bultmann emphatically denied the existence of
supernatural world of angels
and demons
argued that these were ancient "myths'
and that the New
Testament message had to be
demythologized" by removing such
mythological elements s0 that the gospel could be received by modern,
scientific people. Others have thought that the contemporary equivalent to the
(unacceptable_
demonic activity mentioned in Scripture
the powerful and
sometimes evil influence of organizations and
structures" in OUr society
roday
evil governments and powerful corporations that control thousands of
people are sometimes said to be
demonic;
especially in the
of more
liberal
theologians_
However; if Scripture gives US
true account of the world as it really is, then
we must take seriously its portrayal of intense demonic involvement in human
society. Our failure t0 perceive that involvement with our five senses simply
will
during -
day
deny
writings
tells us that we have some deficiencies in our ability t0 understand the world,
not that demons do not exist: In fact; there is nO reason t0 think that there is
any less demonic activity in the world today than there was at the time of the
New Testament: We are in the same time period in God'$ overall plan for
history (the church age or the new covenant ageF
and the millennium has not
yet come when Satan'$ influence
be removed from the earth:
Much of our
western secularized society
unwilling
admit the existence of demons
except perhaps in "primitive'
societies
and relegates all talk of demonic
activity t0
category of superstition But the unwillingness of modern society
[O recognize the presence of demonic activily [oday is_
from
biblical
perspective, simply due to people's blindness t0 the true nature of reality:
But what kind of activity do demons engage in today? Are there some
distinguishing characteristics that
enable us to recognize demonic activity
when
occurS?
2. Not AlI Evil and Sin Is From Satan and Demons_
but Some Is. If we
think of the overall emphasis of the New Testament epistles,
realize that
very little space is given to discussing demonic activity in the lives of
believers Or methods to resist and oppose such activity. The emphasis is on
telling believers not to sin but to live lives of righteousness.
For example, in
Corinthians
when there is
problem of
dissensions;
Paul does not tell the
church t0 rebuke
spirit of dissension
but simply urges them to
agree
and
"be united in the same mind and the same judgment"
Cor: 1.10). When
there is
problem of incest; he does not tell the Corinthians t0 rebuke
spirit
of incest, but tells them that
ought to be outraged and that they should
exercise church discipline until the offender repents
Cor: 5.1-5). When
there is
problem of Christians going tO court tO sue other believers, Paul
does not command them t0 cast out
spirit of litigation (01 selfishness_
strife), but simply tells them t0 settle those cases within the church and to be
give up their own self-interest (1 Cor: 6.1-8). When there is
disorder at the Lord's Supper; he does not command them t0 cast out
spirit
of disorder Or gluttony Or selfishness, but simply tells them that they should
wait fOr one another'
and that each person should
examine himself, and s0
eat ot the bread and drink of the cup
Cor: 11.33,28). These examples
could be duplicated many times in the other New Testament epistles_
with regard
preaching the gospel
to unbelievers
the New Testament
pattern is the same: although occasionally Jesus Or Paul would cast out
demonic spirit that was
significant hindrance to proclaiming the
gospel
certain area (see Mark 5.1-20 [Gerasene demoniac]; 16.16-18
[soothsaying girl at Philippi]) , that is not the usua
pattern of ministry
will
Will
they
willing
causing
presented, where the emphasis
simply on
preaching the gospel (Matt: 9.35;
Rom. 1.18-19;
Cor: 117-2.5). Even in the examples above, the opposition
was encountered in the process of gospel proclamation. In marked contrast -
the practice of those who today emphasize
strategic level spiritual warfare;
in no instance does anyone in the New Testament
summon
territorial
spirit
upon
entering
area t0 preach the gospel (in both examples above the
demon was in
person and the demon-influenced person initiated the
confrontation), 0r (2) demand information from demons about
local
demonic hierarchy; (3) say that we should believe or teach information
derived from demons_
teach by word 0r example that certain
demonic
strongholds '
over
city have to be broken before the
gospel can be
proclaimed with effectiveness_
Rather; Christians just preach the gospel, and it
comes with power [0
change lives! (Of course_
demonic opposition may arise,
or God himself may reveab
the nature of certain demonic
opposition_
which
Christians would then pray and battle against; according
Cor: 12.10;
Cor: 10.3-6; Eph: 6.12).
Therefore, though the New Testament clearly recognizes the influence of
demonic activity in the world, and even,
shall see_
upon the lives of
believers_
primary focus regarding evangelism and Christian growth is on
the choices and actions taken by people themselves (see also Gal. 5.16-26
Eph: 41-6.9; Col. 31-4.6; et al.) Similarly; this should be the primary focus
of our efforts today when we strive t0 grow
holiness and faith and to
overcome the sinful desires and actions that remain
our
Rom 6.1-
23) and [0 overcome the
temptations that come against us from an
unbelieving world (1 Cor: 10.13).
We need t0 accept Our own responsibility
obey the Lord and not t0 shift blame for our
Mn
misdeeds onto some
demonic force_
Nevertheless_
number of passages show that the New Testament authors
were definitely aware of the presence of demonic influence in the world and
in the lives of Christians themselves
[0 the church at Corinth which
was filled with temples devoted to worship of idols_
Paul said that
what
pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God" (1 Cor: 10.20),
situation true not onlv of Corinth but also of most other cities in the ancient
Mediterranean world_
Paul also warned that in the latter
some would
depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of
demons
[im.
4.1), and that this would lead to claims for avoiding
marriage and
avoiding certain foods (v 3), both of which God had created as
4). Thus he saw some false doctrine as
demonic in origin. In
Timothy; Paul implies that those who oppose sound doctrine have been
captured by the devil to do his will:
And the Lord's servant must not be
Hives '
Writing
days
good"
being
quarrelsome but kindly to every one_
an apt teacher; forbearing;
correcting his
opponents with gentleness_
God may perhaps grant that they
repent and
come t0 know the truth, and
may escape from the snare of the devil, after
being captured by him to do his will
(2 Tim: 2.24-26).
Jesus had similarly asserted that the Jews who obstinately opposed him were
following their father the devil:
You are of your father the devil, and your
will is t0 do your father"
desires
He was
murderer from the
beginning and
has nothing
do with the truth; because there
no truth in him. When he
lies_
he speaks according t0 his own nature_
for he is
liar and the father of
lies"
(John 8.44)
Emphasis on the hostile deeds of unbelievers as having demonic influence or
sometimes demonic origin is made more explicit in John's first epistle. He
makes
general statement that "he who commits sin is of the devil" (1 John
3.8), and goes on to say; "By this
may be seen who are the children of God
and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of
God
nor he who does not love his brother "
John 310). Here John
characterizes all those who are not born of God as children of the devil and
subject to his influence and desires. So Cain, when he murdered Abel; "was of
the evil one and murdered his brother"
John 3.12) , even though there
mention of influence by Satan
the text of Genesis (Gen. 41-16). John also
says
"We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of
the evil one
John 5.19). Then in Revelation Satan is called "the deceiver
of the whole world" (Rev 12.9). As we noted above; Satan is also called "the
ruler of this world" (John 14.30), "the
of this world" (2 Cor: 4.4) , and
spirit that is nOw at work in the sons of disobedience
(Eph: 2.2).
When we combine all of these statements and see that Satan is thought of as
the originator of lies_
murder; deception; false teaching; and sin generally;
then it seems reasonable t0 conclude that the New [estament wants US [0
understand that there is some degree of demonic influence
nearly all
wrongdoing and sin that occurs today: Not all sin is caused by Satan or
demons_
nor is the major influence 0r cause of sin demonic activity; but
demonic activity is probably
factor in almost all sin and almost all
destructive activity that opposes the work of God in the world today:
In the lives of Christians, as we noted above
the emphasis of the New
Testament is not on the influence of demons but on the sin that remains in the
believer's life. Nevertheless_
should recognize that
(even by
Christians) does give
foothold for some kind of demonic influence in our
lives
Thus Paul could say;
Be angry but do not sin; d not let the sun g0
will
they
god =
"the
sinning
down on your anger; and give no opportunity t0 the devil" (Eph
4.26)
Wrongful anger apparently can give opportunity for the devil (or demons) to
exert some kind of negative influence in our lives
perhaps by attacking uS
through our emotions and perhaps by increasing the wrongful anger that we
already feel
against others. Similarly, Paul mentions "the breastplate of
righteousness
(Eph: 6.14) as
part of the armor that we are to use standing
the wiles of the devil" and in
contending
the principalities
against the powers_
the world rulers of this present darkness, against
the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places" (Eph: 6.11-12). If
have areas of continuing sin in our lives, then there are weaknesses and
holes in our "breastplate of righteousness,
and these are areas in which we
are vulnerable to demonic attack: By contrast; Jesus_
who was perfectly free
from sin, could say of Satan; "He has no
powe
over me"
(John 14.30). We
may also note the connection between not
and not
touched by
the evil one in
John 5.18: "We know that any one born of God does not
sin,
but He who was born of God keeps him, and the
one does not touch
him:
The preceding passages suggest, then, that where there is
pattern of
persistent sin
the life of .
Christian
one area 0r another; the primary
responsibility for that sin rests with the individual Christian and his or her
choices
continue that wrongful pattern (see Rom: 6, esp. vV: 12-16; also
Gal: 5.16-26). Nevertheless, there could possibly be some demonic influence
contributing
and
intensifying that sinful tendency For
Christian who has
prayed and struggled for years to overcome
bad temper; for example; there
might be
spirit of anger that is one factor in that continued pattern of sin.
Christian who has struggled fOr some time [0 overcome
sense of depression
may have been under attack by
spirit of depression or discouragement, and
this could be one factor contributing to the overall situation.
believer who
has struggled in other
areas, such as unwillingness tO submit [0
rightful
authority; or lack of self-control in
or laziness
bitterness_
0r envy;
etc.
may consider whether
demonic attack or influence could be
contributing
this situation and hindering his or her effectiveness for the
Lord.
Can
Christian Be Demon Possessed? The term demon possession is an
unfortunate term that has found its way into some
English translations of the
Bible but is not really reflected in the Greek text: The Greek New Testament
can speak of people who
have
demon
(Matt: 1.18; Luke 7.33; 8.27; John
7.20; 8.48, 49,52; 10.20), or it can speak of
who are
suffering from
demonic influence (Gk: daimonizomai),
but it never uses
language that
Jgainst -
against =
Jgainst !
sinning
being
evil
eating;
people
suggests that =
demon actually
possesses
someone_
The problem with the terms demon possession and demonized is that they
give the nuance of such strong demonic influence that
seem t0 imply that
the person who
under demonic attack has no choice but [0 succumb t0
They suggest that the person is unable any longer t0 exercise his or her will
and is completely under the domination of the
spirit: While this may have
been tnue in extreme cases such as that of the Gerasene demoniac (see Mark
5.1-20; note that after Jesus cast the demons out of him, he was then "in his
right mind
15), it is certainly not true with many cases of demonic attack
conflict with demons in many people s lives.
So what should we say to the question,
Can
Christian be demon
possessed?" The answer depends on what someone means by
possessed:
Since the term does not reflect any word found in the Greek New Testament;
people can define
to mean various
without
clear warrant [0
anchor it [0 any verse of
Scripture, and it becomes difficult to say that one
person $ definition is right and another one
wrong: My own preference
for
reasons
explained above
iS not [0 use the phrase demon
possessed at all, for
any kinds of cases_
But if people explain clearly what
mean by
demon possessed,
then an
answer can be given depending on the definition they give: If by
demon
possessed"
mean that
person
will is completely dominated by
demon,
thac
person has no power left tO chose t0 do right and obey God
then the answer [0 whether
Christian could be demon possessed would
certainly be no, for Scripture guarantees that sin shall have no dominion over
uS since we have been raised with Christ (Rom. 6.14, see also
4,11).
On the other hand, most Christians would agree that there can be
differing
degrees of demonic attack or influence in the lives of believers (see Luke 4.2;
2 Cor: 12.7; Eph: 6.12; James 4.7;
Peter 5.8).
believer may come under
demonic attack from time t0 time in
mild or more strong sense
(Note the
"daughter of Abraham'
whom "Satan bound for eighteen years'
So that she
"had
spirit of infirmity
and
was bent over and could not fully straighten
herself
[Luke 13.16, 11].) Though Christians after Pentecost have
fuller
power of the Holy Spirit working within them to enable them to triumph over
demonic attacks_
do not always call upon 0r even know about the
power that is rightfully theirs.
So how severe can demonic influence become
in the life of
Christian after Pentecost who is indwelt by the Holy Spirit?
Before
answering this question; we should note that it is similar t0
question
they
evil
things -
having "
they
they
they
about sin: "How much can
genuine Christian let his or her life be dominated
by sin, and still be
born-again Christian?" It is difficult to answer that
question in the abstract; because we realize that when Christians are nOt
as they ought to live_
and when
are nOt
benefiting from regular
fellowship with other Christians and from regular Bible study and teaching;
they can stray into significant degrees of sin and still can be said to be bOm-
again Christians
But the situation is abnormal; it is nOr what the Christian life
should be and can be. Similarly, if we ask how much demonic influence can
come into the life of
genuine Christian_
it is hard tO give an answer in the
abstract:
We are simply asking how abnormal
Christian $ life can become;
especially if that person does not know about or make use of the weapons of
spiritual warfare that are available t0 Christians, persists in some kinds of sin
that give entrance t0 demonic activity; and is outside the reach of any ministry
that is accustomed tO giving spiritual help against demonic attack: It would
seem that in such cases the
degree of demonic attack Or influence in
Christian'$ life could be quite strong:
It would not be corect to say there can
be no such influence because the person is
Christian. Therefore when
someone asks, "Can
Christian be demon possessed?" but really means
"Can
Christian come under quite strong influence 0r attack by demons?" then the
dnswe[
would have t0 be
positive one but with the caution that the word
possessed is here being used in
confusing way: Since the term demon
possessed is
misleading
one t0 use in all cases,
especially when referring to
Christians_
would prefer to avoid it altogether: It seems better simply to
recognize that there can be varying degrees of demonic attack Or influence on
people_
even on Christians_
and [0
leave it at that: In all cases the remedy will
be the same anyway: rebuke the demon in the name of Jesus and command it
leave (see discussion below)
How Can Demonic Influences Be Recognized? In severe cases of
demonic influence_
reported in the Gospels; the affected person would
exhibit bizarre and often violent actions, especially opposition to the
preaching of the gospel. When Jesus came into the synagogue in Capernaum
"immediately there was in their synagogue
man with an unclean spirit; and
he cried Out; *What have YOu t0 do with uS, Jesus of Nazareth? Have YOu
come [0
destroy us?
know who you are, the
One of God'
(Mark
1.23-24). The man stood up and interrupted the service by
shouting
these
things (01; more precisely; the demon within the man shouted them)
After Jesus came down from the Mount of
Transfiguration;
man
brought his
son to Jesus saying
"He has
dumb spirit; and wherever
seizes him; it
dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.
Then
brought the boy t0 Jesus, "and when the spirit saw him;
living
they
Holy
they
immediately
convulsed the
and he fell on the ground and rolled about;
foaming at the mouth:
The father said,
"It has often cast him into the fire and
into the water; t0 destroy him" (Mark 9.17-18,20,22). Such violent actions,
especially those
toward destruction of the affected person; were clear
indications of demonic activity. Similar actions are seen in the case of the
Gerasene demoniac;
man with an unclean spirit; who lived among the tombs; and no one
could bind him any more, even with
chain; for he had often been
bound with fetters and chains_
but the chains he wrenched apart; and
the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue
him: Night and
among the tombs and on the mountains he was
always crying out, and bruising himself with stones. (Mark 5.2-5)
When Jesus caSt Out the demons SO that
could not destroy the man in
whom
had lived,
destroyed the herd of swine into which they
immediately entered (Mark 5.13). Satanic Or demonic activity always tends
toward the ultimate destruction of parts of God $ creation and especially of
human
who are made in the image of God (cf. Ps.
106.37
on child
sacrifice):
In this
regard
it is interesting [O note that in one case
when Jesus healed an
epileptic he did it by casting out
demon (Matt: 17.14-18), but elsewhere
epileptics are distinguished from those who are under demonic influence:
brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and
pains
demoniacs; epileptics, and paralytics
and he healed them'
(Matt: 4.24).
So it is with other cases of physical sickness: in some cases; Jesus simply
prayed for the person or spoke
word and the person was healed. In other
cases there are hints or implicit statements of demonic influence in the
affliction:
woman who had had
spirit of infirmity for eighteen years"
(Luke 13.11) was healed by Jesus
then he explicitly said that she was
daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years'
(Luke 13.16). In
Peter "
mother-in-law; Jesus "rebuked the fever; and it left her" (Luke
4.39) , suggesting that there was some personal influence (probably therefore
demonic) that was capable of receiving
rebuke from Jesus_
In other cases
the Epistles indicate that demonic influence will lead to
blatantly false doctrinal statements, such as exclaiming; "Jesus be cursed"
Cor: 12.3), 01
refusal to confess "that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh"
John 4.2-3). In both instances
the context deals with the
of people
who may be "false prophets
and who want [0 use
spiritual gifts to speak in
the assembly ot the church
Cor: 12) or specifically
prophesy
John
boy ,
tending
day =
they
they
they
beings
"They
and
healing
testing
4.1-6).
These passages do not indicate that all false doctrine should be
thought to be demonically inspired
buc blatantly false doctrinal statements
made by those who profess to be speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit
would certainly fall into this category When at Corinth there was active
entrenched opposition to Paul s apostolic authority by those who claimed
be apostles but were nOL, Paul saw them as servants of Satan disguised as
servants of righteousness (2 Cor: 11:13-15).
In addition
these outwardly evident indications, demonic activity was
sometimes recognized by
subjective sense of the presence of an evil
spiritual influence_
Corinthians 12.10, Paul mentions "the ability to
distinguish berween spirits'
"discerning of spirits
KJV) as one kind of
spiritual gift: This gift would seem to be an ability t0 sense Or discern the
difference in the working of the Holy Spirit and the working of evil spirits in
person $ life_
The gift would apparently include an awareness of demonic
influence that-
be registered both in terms of objective, observable facts,
and also in terms of emotional andior spiritual uneasiness Or perception of the
presence of evil.
But does this ability tO perceive demonic influence have t0 be limited t0 those
with this special gift? As with all spiritual gifts
would seem that there are
degrees of intensity or strength in the development of this gift as well
some may have this
gift developed to
very high degree and others may find
it functioning only occasionally. Moreover; in the lives of all believers_
there
may be
something analogous t0 this gift, some kind of ability to sense in their
spirits the presence of the
Spirit Or to sense demonic influence
time
to time in other people_
Paul speaks of
positive kind of spiritual
perception that believers have when
encounter him and his co-workers:
"For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and
among those who are
perishing;
[0 one
fragrance
death to death; to the
other
fragrance from life to life'
(2 Cor: 2.15-16). In the ordinary course of
life today; sometimes Christians will have
subjective sense that someone
else is
Christian before they have opportunity to find out that that is in fact
the case.
And
seems likely that an opposite spiritual perception could also
occur from time t0 time, whereby the believer would sense the presence of
demonic influence in
person's life before there were other; more objective
indications of that fact
Moreover; sometimes
person who is under spiritual attack from
demonic
power will know
or sense iL:
mature pastor 0r
Christian friend, in
counseling someone about
difficult problem; may find it wise
ask; "Do
would
Holy
from
fact;
they
from
you think that an attack by any evil spiritual force could be
factor in this
situation?" The person may simply say; "No,
but in many instances the
person being counseled will have thought of that possibility Or even have
been quite clearly aware of it, but afraid t0 say
anything for fear of
thought strange. Such
person will be encouraged that another Christian
would consider this as
possible tactor:
In all of these attempts to
recognize demonic influence,
we muSt remember
that no spiritual gift functions perfectly in this age
nor d0 we have
tull
knowledge
people'$ hearts_
~We all make many mistakes_
as James
recognizes (James 3.2).
There are many cases where we are somewhat unsure
whether _
person is
genuine Christian Or not; Or where we are somewhat
unsure whether
person
motives are sincere: There are also times when we
are unclear as to the direction God is leading US in our lives
O1 we may be
uncertain about whether it is appropriate tO speak Or remain silent about
certain matter: So it should not surprise Us that there may be some degree of
uncertainty
ouI perception of the presence of demonic
influence as well
This does not mean that we should ignore the possibility of demonic
influence; however; and as we grow in spiritual maturity and sensitivity; and
a5 we
experience in ministering t0 the needs of others, Our ability
recognize demonic influence in various situations will no doubt increase.
5. Jesus Gives AlL Believers Authority to Rebuke Demons and Command
t0 Leave
When Jesus sent the twelve disciples ahead of him t0 preach
the kingdom of God_
gave them power and authority over all demons'
(Luke 9:1). After the seventy had preached the kingdom of God in towns and
villages
they retured with
saying
"Lord_
even the demons are Subject t0
uS inyour namel
(Luke 10.17), and Jesus told them,
have given you
authority
over all the power of the enemy" (Luke 10.19).
When Philip, the
evangelist; went down to Samaria t0 preach the gospel of Christ;
unclean
spirits came out of many who had them'
(Acts 8.7_
author'$ translation), and
Paul used spiritual authority over demons [0 say to
spirit of divination in a
soothsaying girl, "[
You in the name of Jesus Christ t0 come out of
(Acts 16.18).
Paul was aware of the spiritual authority he had
both in face-[O-face
encounters such as he had in Acts 16
and in his prayer life as well_
He said,
"For though we live in the world we are not carrying on
worldly war; for the
weapons of our
warfare are not worldly but have divine power t0 destroy
strongholds" (2 Cor: 10.3-4). Moreover; he
some
length of the
struggle Christians have
"the wiles of the devil" in his description of
conflict
against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places" (see
being
Eain
Themn
joy;
charge
her"
spoke
against -
Eph: 6.10-18). James tells all his readers (in many churches)
resist the
devil and he
flee from you'
(James 4.7) . Similarly; Peter tells his readers
in many churches in Asia Minor;
Your adversary the devil prowls around
like
roaring
seeking some one t0 devour: Resist him, firm in your faith'
Peter 5.8-9).
Some may object that Jude
teaches that Christians should not command or
rebuke evil spirits. It says: "But when the archangel Michael, contending with
the devil, disputed about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce
judgment upon him, but said,
The Lord rebuke you
However; in context Jude is not
talking about Christians in their encounters
with demonic forces, but is pointing out the eror of immoral and rebellious
false teachers who "reject authority
in general and "slander celestial
(v 8 NIV): on their own authority
foolishly speak blasphemous words
against heavenly beings, whether angelic or demonic. The reference
Michael is simply to show that the greatest angelic creature,
matter how
powerful, did not presume to go beyond the limits of the authority that God
had given him The false teachers, however; have far overstepped their
bounds, and they show their foolishness when they "revile whatever they do
not understand" (v 10). The lesson of the verse is simply; "Don't try t0 go
beyond the authority God has given
When Jude 9 is viewed in this way;
the only question thar arises for
Christian from this verse is_
"Whar authority
has God given US over demonic forces?" And the rest of the New Testament
clearly to that in several places.
Not only Jesus; and not only his
twelve disciples, but also the seventy disciples, and Paul, and Philip (who was
not an apostle
are given authority over demons by the Lord Jesus (see verses
above). Jude
therefore simply cannot mean that it is wrong for human
beings t0 rebuke or command demons,
Or that it is wrong for any but the
apostles
do so. In fact; both Peter and James encourage all Christians
resist" the devil, and Paul encourages believers in general tO put on spiritual
armor and prepare for spiritual warfare
Before
examine in more detail how that authority works out in practice, it
is impontant;
that we recognize that the work of Christ on the cross is the
ultimate basis for our authority over demons.
Though Christ won
victory
over Satan in the wildemess_
the New Testament epistles
to the cross as
the moment when Satan was decisively defeated. Jesus took on flesh and
blood_
"that through death He might render powerless him who had the power
of death; that is_
the devil" (Heb: 2.14 NASB) At the cross God
disarmed
the principalities and powers and made
public example of them; triumphing
will
lion,
reviling
belugs
they
youl"
speaks
first,
point
over
them in him" (Col. 2:15). Therefore Satan hates the cross of Christ;
because there he was decisively defeated forever: Because the blood of Christ
speaks clearly of his death; we read in Revelation of those who overcame
Satan by Christ's blood
conflict in this world:
And
have
conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony
(Rev: 12.11).
Because of Christ'$ death on the cross, our sins are completely
forgiven, and Satan has no rightful authority over uS
Second;
our membership as children in God's family is the firm spiritual
position from which we engage in spiritual warfare _
Paul says
every
Christian
For in Christ Jesus YOu are all sons of God, through faith" (Gal:
3.26)
When Satan comes t0 attack uS
he is
attacking
One
of God'$ own
children,
member of God's own family: this truth gives us authority t0
successfully wage war
against him and defeat him.
If we as believers find
appropriate
speak
word of rebuke to
demon; it
is important to remember that we need not fear demons. Although Satan and
demons have much less power than the power of the Holy Spirit at work
within uS
one of Satan
tactics is [0 attempt t0 cause US t0 be afraid_
Instead
of giving in to such fear; Christians should remind themselves of the truths of
Scripture_
which tell uS, "You are of God, and have overcome them; for he
who
in you is greater than he who is in the world "
John 4.4), and "God
did not give uS
spirit of timidity but
spirit of power and love and self-
1:7)5
What Paul says about the Philippians in their
relationship
human opponents can also be applied when
demonic
opposition to the gospel
Paul tells them to stand
and to be
not
frightened in anything by your opponents This is
clear omen t0 them of
their destruction, but of your salvation; and that from God" (Phil. 128). He
also tells the Ephesians that in their spiritual warfare
are [0 use the
"shield of faith" with which they can
quench all the flaming darts of the evil
one
(Eph: 6.16). This is
important, since the opposite
fear is faith in
God
He also tells them to be bold in their spiritual conflict; so that;
taken the whole armor of God, they
'may be able to withstand in the evil day;
and having done all, t0 stand" (Eph: 6.13). In their conflict with hostile
spiritual forces_
Paul's readers should not run away in retreat OL
cower in
but should stand their ground boldly; knowing that their weapons and their
armor "have divine power
destroy
strongholds" (2 Cor: 10.4; cf.
John
5.18).
We may ask; however; why does God want Christians t0 speak directly t0 the
demon who

drive away the demon for them? In
way; this is similar
asking why

having

Christians should share the gospel
with another person rather than simply
praying and asking God to reveal the gospel to that person directly: Or why
should we
words of encouragement to
Christian who is discouraged
rather than just praying and
God himself to encourage that person
directly? Why should we speak
word of rebuke or gentle admonition t0
Christian whom we see involved in some kind of sin, rather than just praying
and
God t0 take care of the sin
that person' $ life? The answer t0 all
these questions
that in the world that God has created_
he has given uS
very active role
canying out his plans, especially his plans for the
advancement of the
kingdom and the building up of the church: In all of these
cases_
our direct involvement and activity is important in addition t0 OuL
prayers_
And s0 ir seems t0 be in our
with demonic forces as well.
Like
wise father who does not settle all of his children s disputes for them,
but sometimes sends them back out to the playground to settle
dispute
themselves,
S0 our heavenly Father encourages US tO enter directly into
conflict with demonic forces in the name of Christ and in the power of the
Holy Spirit: Thereby he enables us to gain the joy of participating in eternally
significant ministry and the joy of triumphing over the destructive power of
Satan and his demons in people's lives. It is not that God could not deal with
demonic attacks every time we prayed and asked him [0 do s0_
for he
certainly could and he no doubt sometimes does_
But the New Testament
pattern seems t0 be that God ordinarily expects Christians themselves to
speak directy t0 the unclean spirits:
In actual practice, this authority t0 rebuke demons may result in briefly
speaking
command to an evil spirit to leave when we suspect the presence
of demonic influence in our personal
lives 0r the lives of those around us
We are to "resist the devil" (James 4.7), and he will flee from us.
Sometimes
very brief command
the name of Jesus will be enough:
other times it will be helpful to quote Scripture in the process of
commanding
an evil spirit to leave
situation. Paul
of "the sword of the Spirit;
which is the word of God" (Eph. 6.17)_
And Jesus_
when he was tempted by
Satan in the wilderness, repeatedly quoted Scripture in response to Satan $
temptations (Matt: 4:1-11). Appropriate Scriptures may include general
statements of the triumph of Jesus over Satan (Matt: 12.28-29; Luke 10.17 _
19; 2 Cor: 10.3-4; Col. 2.15; Heb: 2.14; James 4.7;
Peter 5.8-9;
John 3.8;
4.4; 5.18),
but also verses that speak directly to the particular temptation Or
difficulty at hand.
In our Own personal
if we find sinful emotions that are unusually strong
speak -
asking "
asking
dealing `
speaks
lives;
up in our minds or hearts (whether
be emotions of irrational fear;
anger; hatred, bitterness, lust; greed, etc.), in addition to praying and asking
Jesus for help in overcoming them, it would also be appropriate for uS t0 say
something like;
Spirit of fear; in Jesus' name_
command you; g0 away from
here and don
retur!" Even though we may be unsure whether there is
demonic factor in that particular situation, and even though
demon $
presence may be only one
factor
contributing
the situation; nonetheless_
such words of rebuke will sometimes be very effective: Though we do not
have in the New Testament _
complete record of the personal prayer life of
the apostle Paul, he talks openly about wrestling
not
against flesh and
blood_
buc
against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places
(Eph: 6.12) and about
not carrying on
worldly war" (2 Cor: 10.3).
It is reasonable t0 think that his Own extensive prayer life included this kind
of verbal rebuke of demonic forces as one aspect of his spiritual warfare:
Moreover; such wrestling
against
spiritual hosts of wickedness"
may
mean that in our private times of intercessory prayer for others we
include an element of verbal rebuke t0 demonic forces that may be
component in situations for which we are
praying: (This kind of spiritual
warfare would not be in the presence of the person for whom
We are
concerned, who in many cases would be confused or frightened
unnecessarily.) For example, parents may appropriately include
brief word
of rebuke [0
spirit of rebelliousness in one child
of laziness in another; Or of
anger in yet another; in addition to praying that the Lord would give victory in
those areas, and in addition t0
and
disciplining their children.
Appropriate Use of the Christian'$ Spiritual Authority in Ministry
Other People: When we pass from the discussion of private spiritual warfare
in our OWn
personal lives and perhaps the lives of close family members_
move t0 the question of direct personal ministry tO others who have come
under spiritual attack:
FOr example
we may at times be involved in
counseling
or prayer with another person when we suspect that demonic
activity is
factor in their situation: In these cases, some additional
considerations must be kept in mind_
it is important nOt tO frighten people by
very glibly about an area
that may be familiar t0 us but quite unfamiliar and somewhat frightening to
others_
The Holy Spirit is
Spirit of gentleness and peace (see
Cor: 14.33)
Because of this, it is often considerate simply to ask questions of the person
we are helping_
We might ask; "Do YOu think an evil spirit may be attacking
yOu in this situation?" Or
Would you mind if
spoke
word ot rebuke
any
spirit that may be
factor in this?" It would also be important
assure
welling
they
"the
Will
teaching
First
talking
evil
the person that if there is
demonic factor involved,
should not be thought
of as
negative reflection on the person's spiritual condition but may simply
indicate that Satan is trying t0 attack the person t0 keep him or her from more
effective ministry for the Lord_
Each Christian is
soldier in the Lord $
spiritual army and therefore subject t0 attacks from the forces of the enemy:
If the other person gives permission t0 do sO,
brief command should be
spoken aloud, telling the
spirit to leave_
Since the person under attack
often have had
sense of
demonic presence_
would be appropriate,
after
commanding the evil spirit to
eave
to ask the person if he or she felt or
sensed
anything different when those words were spoken_
If there really was
demonic influence in the situation, the person may express an immediate
feeling of relief or freedom, often with
sense of joy and peace as well
All of this does nor have t0 be
highly dramatic or emotionally charged
procedure:
Some contemporary stories tell of long
drawn-out battles in Which
the Christian counselor argues with the demon and shouts at
repeatedly over
period of several hours_
But there is no indication in the New Testament thar
demons are
of hearing; nor are there examples of such
periods of
conflict in order t0 get
demon [0 leave. Jesus simply
cast out the spirits
with
word" (Matt. 8.16), even though in one case (with the Gerasene
demoniac) the evil spirit showed some initial resistance (see Mark 5.8; Luke
8.29). Jesus then asked its name and then cast out many demons at once
(Mark 5.9-13; Luke 8.30-33). The power
cast ouI demons comes not
ouI own strength or the power of our own voice, but from the
Spirit
(Matt_ 12.28; Luke 11.20). Thus,
quiet; confident; authoritative tone of
voice should be sufficient
Second
to avoid
drawn into
conversation 0r battle with the
demon itself the Christian counselor should focus not on the demon but on the
person being ministered to and the truths of the Bible that need to be affirmed
and believed. The
belt of truth" (Eph: 6.14 NIV) is part of the armor that
protects US against Satan, as is the
sword of the Spirit; which is the word of
God" (Eph: 6.17). If the person who is receiving ministry will focus on and
believe the truth of Scripture and will renounce sin and thereby put on the
"breastplate of righteousness" (Eph: 6.14), then the evil spirit will have no
foothold in that person'
life. If the demon refuses to leave in spite of the
command given in the name of Jesus
then it may be best [0 wait until another
time after more prayer and personal spiritual preparation on the part of the
person being ministered to and the persons who are engaging in this ministry
(Matt. 17.19-20; Mark 9.29;
discussions below)

Third, it is important for Christians not to become overly curious in this area
of demonic conflict Though it is
ministry that the Lord gives all Christians
authority t0 engage in, Scripture nonetheless tells us that we are to be "babes
in evil" (1 Cor: 14.20).
That is
we are not to become overly fascinated with
matters of evil and attempt
become
experts
some kinds
evil just t0
satisfy our curiosity:
Fourth, if the person being ministered t0 is nOt
Christian,
is important that
he or she be urged to come to Christ as Savior immediately after the demon is
cast out S0 that the Holy Spirit will reside in the person and protect him or her
from future attacks.
Otherwise there may be
worse result later:
When the unclean spirit has gone out of
man; he passes through
warerless places
rest; but he finds none. Then he says,
will
retum t0 my house from which
came_
And when he comes he finds
empty;, swept, and put in order: Then he goes and brings with him
seven other spirits more
than himself; and
enter and dwell
there
and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So
shall it be also with this evil generation. (Matt: 12.43-45)
Fifth, effectiveness in difficult cases of demonic influence may be related t0
ouI own spiritual
condition. When Jesus had cast _
demon out of an epileptic
boy; and "the boy was cured instantly;
the disciples privately came t0 Jesus
and asked; "Why could
not cast it out?" (Matt: 17.18-19). Jesus said to
them_
"Because of your little faith" (Matt. 17.20). Mark's gospel reports that
Jesus also said in response t0 the disciples_
"This kind cannot be driven out by
anything but
(Mark 9.29). The disciples apparently were at that time
weak in faith; they had not spent enough time
prayer recently and they
nol
walking fully in the power of the Holy Spirit
Jesus issues
clear warning that we should not rejoice tOo much or become
proud in our power over demons_
but that we should rejoice rather in our great
salvation
We must keep this in mind lest we become proud and the Holy
Spirit withdraw his power from 4S.
When the seventy returned with joy
saying; "Lord, even the demons are subject t0 US in YOur namel" (Luke 10.17)
Jesus told them; "Do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but
rejoice that your names are written
heaven'
(Luke 10.20).
We Should Expect the Gospel
Come in Power to Triumph Over the
Works of the Devil. When Jesus came preaching the gospel
in Galilee;
"demons also came out of many'
(Luke 4.41). When Philip went
Samaria
seeking
evil
they
prayer"
Were
preach the gospel,
'unclean spirits came out of many
crying with
loud
voice'
(Acts 8.7). Jesus commissioned Paul to preach among the Gentiles
they may turn from darkness t0
light and from the power of Satan to
God
that they may receive forgiveness of sins and
place among those who
are sanctified by faith in me
(Acts 26.18) . Paul's proclamation
the gospel,
he said_
was
not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit and of power; that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in
the power of God" (1 Cor: 2.4-5; cf: 2 Cor: 10.3-4). If we really believe the
scriptural testimony t0 the existence and activity of demons_
and if we really
believe that "the reason the Son of God appeared was t0 destroy the works of
the devil" (1 John 3.8), then it would seem appropriate t0 expect that even
today when the gospel is proclaimed tO unbelievers, and when prayer is made
for believers who have perhaps been unaware
this dimension of spiritual
conflict; there Will be
genuine and often immediately recognizable triumph
over the power of the enemy: We should expect that this would happen, think
of it as
normal part of the work of Christ in building up his kingdom, and
rejoice in Christ's victory in it:

Chapter 24
The Creation of Man
Why did God create us? How did God make us like himself? How
can we please him
everyday living?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The previous chapters have discussed the nature of God and his creation of
the universe, the spiritual beings that he created, and his relationship to the
world in terms of
miracles and
answering prayer: In this next section;
we focus on the pinnacle of God's creative activity, his creation of human
beings, both male and female; to be more like him than anything else he has
made.
We will consider first God'$ purpose in
man and the nature of
man as God created him to be (chapters 21-23). Then we will look at the
nature of sin and man'$ disobedience t0 God (chapter 24). Finally, we
examine the initiation of God's plan for saving man, discussing man'$
relationship to God in the covenants that God established (chapter 25).
The Uxo tla Word Man
Reler
J0 the
Before discussing the subject matter of this chapter; it is necessary to consider
briefly whether it
appropriate t0 use the word man tO refer t0 the entire
human race (as in the title for this chapter). Some people today object t0 ever
using the word "man" t0 refer to the human race in general (including both
men and women) , because it is claimed that such usage is insensitive
women. Those who make this objection would prefer that we only use
'gender neutral" terms such as "humanity;'
~humankind
"human
beings,'
'persons" t0 refer t0 the human race_
After
considering this suggestion;
decided t0 continue t0 use the word
man" (as well as several of these other terms _
[0 refer to the human race in
this book because such usage has divine warrant in Genesis 5_
and because
think there is
theological issue at stake_
In Genesis 5.1-2 we read,
When
God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he
crealed them; and he blessed them and named them Man when they
#ere

created" (cf:
Gen: 1.27). The Hebrew term translated
Man" is 'adam, the
same term used for the name of Adam, and the same term that is sometimes
used of man in distinction from woman (Gen 2.22,25; 3.12; Eccl. 7:28).
Therefore the practice of using the same term t0 refer (1) t0 male human
beings and (2) to the human race generally is
practice that originated with
God himself; and we should not find it objectionable or insensitive
Someone might object that this is just an accidental feature of the Hebrew
language
but this argument
not persuasive because Genesis 5.2 specifically
describes God's activity of choosing
name that would apply
the human
race as
whole_
am not here arguing that we must always duplicate biblical patterns of
speech, or that it is wrong [0 use
gender-neutraB
terms sometimes t0 refer [0
the human race (as
just did in this sentence), but rather that God $ naming
activity reported in Genesis 5.2 indicates that the use of "man" t0 refer t0 the
entire race is
good and
appropriate choice, and one that we should not
avoid.
The
theological issue is whether there
suggestion of male leadership Or
headship in the family from the beginning of creation. The fact that God did
not choose t0 call the human race "woman;
but
man;
probably has some
significance for understanding God $ original plan for men and women_
course; this question of the name
we use [0 refer to the race is not the only
factor in that discussion
but it is one factor; and our use of
language in this
does have some significance in the discussion of male-female roles
today:
Why #
Creuted?
God Did Not Need to Create Man, Yet He Created Us for His Own
Glory: In the discussion of God's independence in chapter 11 (see section B);
we noted several Scripture passages that teach that God does not need uS Or
the rest of creation for anything; yet we and the rest of creation glorify him
and bring him joy. Since there was perfect love and fellowship among
members of the Trinity for all eternity (John 17.5, 24), God did not create US
because he was lonely or because he needed fellowship with other persons
God did not need US for any reason:
Nevertheless_
God created us for his own glory: In our treatment of his
independence
we noted that God speaks of his sons and daughters from the
very
regard
ends of the earth as those "whom
created for my glory
(Isa. 43.7; cf: Eph:
1.11-12). Therefore,
we are [0
do all to the glory of God" (1 Cor: 10.31).
This fact guarantees that our lives are significant When we first realize that
God did not need [0 create US and does nOt need uS for
anything_
we could
conclude that our lives have no importance at all.
But Scripture tells uS that
were crealed [0
glorify God, indicating that we are important to God
himself This is the final definition of genuine importance Or significance to
lives: If we are truly important to God for all eternity; then what greater
measure of importance OF
significance could we want?
What Is Our Purpose in Life? The fact that God created us for his own
glory determines the correct answer tO the question, "What is Our purpose in
life?" Our purpose must be t0 fulfill the reason that God created us_
[O glorify
him_
When we are
speaking with respect to God himself; that is
good
summary of our purpose. But when we think of our Own interests,
make
the happy discovery that we are t0 enjoy God and take delight in him and in
OU rel
lationship t0 him: Jesus says,
came that
may have life, and have
it abundantly'
(John 10:10). David tells God, "In your presence there is
fulness of joy; in YOur right hand are pleasures fOr evermore"
(Ps. 16.11). He
longs to dwell
the house of the Lord forever;
behold the beauty 0f the
LORD'
(Ps. 27:4) , and Asaph cries out,
Whom have
in heaven but you?
And there is nothing upon earth that
desire besides you_
My flesh and my heart may fail,
but God is the strength of my heart
and my portion for ever: (Ps. 73.25-26)
Fullness of joy is found in
knowing God and delighting in the excellence of
his character: To be in his presence_
enjoy fellowship with him, is
greater
blessing than anything that can be imagined_
How lovely is your
dwelling place;
0 LORD of hosts!
My soul longs, yea
faints
OM
they
for the courts of the LORD;
my heart and flesh sing for joy
the
God:
For
day in YOur courts is better
than
thousand elsewhere: (Ps. 84.1-2, 10)
Therefore_
the normal heart attitude of
Christian is rejoicing in the Lord and
in the lessons of the life he gives us (Rom. 5.2-3; Phil. 44;
Thess 5.16-18;
James 1.2;
Peter 1.6, 8; et al.)
As we glorify God and enjoy him, Scripture tells us that he rejoices in uS.
read
As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride; so shall your God rejoice
YOu
(Isa. 62.5) , and Zephaniah prophesies that the Lord
will rejoice
over YOU with gladness_
he will renew YOu in his love; he will exult over YOU
with loud singing as on
day of festival" (Zeph: 3.17-18).
'This understanding of the doctrine of the creation of man has very practical
results.
When
realize that God created us
glorify him; and when we
start t0 act in ways that fulfill that purpose, then we begin t0
experience an
intensity of joy in the Lord that we have never before known.
When we add to
that the realization that God himself is rejoicing
our fellowship with him,
our joy becomes "inexpressible and filled with heavenly glory"
(1 Peter 1.8,
author' $ expanded paraphrase)
Someone might object that it is wrong for God t0 seek glory for himself in
man. Certainly it is wrong for human
to seek glory for
themselves;
as we see in the dramatic example of the death of Herod Agrippa
When he proudly accepted the shout of the crowd; "The voice of.
and
not of man!'
(Acts 12.22), "immediately an angel of the Lord smote him,
because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died"
(Acts 12.23). Herod died because he robbed God of glory; glory that God
deserved and he did not.
But when God takes glory to himself; from whom
robbing glory? Is
there anyone who deserves glory more than he does? Certainly not! He is the
Creator; he made all
and he deserves all glory: He
worthy of
receiving glory Man may not seek glory for himself, but in this case what is
wrong for man is right for God
because he is the Creator: It is right; not
living
Over

wrong-
that he be glorified
if he did not receive glory from all
creatures in the universe_
that would be horibly wrong! The twenty-four
elders around God'$ throne continually sing
You are worthy; our Lord and God,
receive glory and honor and power;
for you created all things,
and by your will they existed and
#ere
created:
(Rev: 4.11)
Paul exclaims
For from him and through him and to him are all things. To
him be glory for ever: Amen'
(Rom: 11.36). When we
begin t0 appreciate the
nature of God as the infinitely perfect Creator who deserves all praise_
then
our hearts will not rest until we give him glory with all of our "heart
soul
mind, and
strength" (Mark 12.30).
Man in the
ol God
1. The Meaning of
of God " Out of all the creatures God made
only
one creature
man_
is said to be made "in the image of God:
What does thar
mean? We may use the following definition: The fact that man is in the image
of God means that man is like God and represents God
When God says;
Let uS make man in our
image, after our likeness"
(Gen_
1.26) , the
meaning is that God plans to make
creature similar t0 himself:
Both the Hebrew word for "image
(tselem) and the Hebrew word for
"likeness
(demiit) refer to something that is similar but not identical to the
iC represents Or iS an
'image
of: The word image can also be used of
something that represents something else.
Theologians have spent much time
attempting
to specify one characteristic of
man_
very few; in which the image of God is primarily seen
Some have
thought that the image of God consists in man
intellectual ability; others in
his power tO make moral decisions and
choices.
Others have thought
that the
of God referred t0 man'$ original moral purity; or his creation
as male and female (see Gen. 1.27),or his dominion over the earth
In this discussion
would be best to focus attention primarily on the
fact,
~Image

willing
image
meanings of the words "image'
and "likeness_
As we have seen; these terms
had quite clear meanings t0 the original readers_
When we realize that the
Hebrew words for "image'
and "likeness
simply informed the original
readers that man was like God, and would in many ways represent God, much
of the controversy over the meaning of
of God"
seen [0
search
for too narrow and tO0 specific
meaning
When Scripture reports that God
said, "Let uS make man in our
image, after our likeness"
(Gen: 1.26) , it
simply would have meant to the original readers; "Let Us make man to be like
us and t0 represent uS.
Because "image
and "likeness"
had these meanings, Scripture does not need
say something
The fact that man is in the image of God means that man is like God
in the
following ways: intellectual ability, moral
purity, spiritual
nature, dominion over the earth, creativity; ability t0 make ethical
choices _
and immortality [0r some similar statement]:
Such an explanation is unnecessary; not only because the terms had clear
but also because no such list could do justice t0 the subject: the text
only needs t0 affirm that man is like God, and the rest of Scripture fills in
more details t0 explain this. In
read the rest of Scripture,
realize that
full understanding of man'$ likeness t0 God would require
full
understanding of who God is in his being and in his actions and
full
understanding of who man
and what he does. The more we know about
God and man the more similarities we will
recognize, and the more fully we
will understand what Scripture means when
says that man is in the image of
God: The expression refers to every way in which man is like God_
This
understanding of what
means that man
created in the image of God
is reinforced by the similarity between Genesis 1:26
where God declares his
intention to create man in his image and likeness_
and Genesis 5.3:
Adam had lived
hundred and
years; he became the father of
son in
his own likeness [demiit]; after his image [tselem], and named him Seth:
Seth
was nOt identical [0
Adam; but he was like him in many ways
son is like
his father: The text simply means that Seth was like Adam. It does not specify
any specific number of ways that Seth was like Adam; and it would be overly
restrictive for US [0 assert that one 0r another characteristic determined the
way in which Seth was in Adam'$ image and likeness_
Was it his brown eyes?
Or his curly hair? Perhaps
was his athletic prowess_
or his serious
disposition 0r even his quick temper? Of course, such speculation would be
useless_
It is evident that every way
which Seth was like Adam would be

the image and

The Fall: God's Image Is Distorted but Not Lost We might wonder
whether man could still be thought to be like God after he sinned. This
question is answered quite early in Genesis where God gives Noah the
authority
establish the death penalty for murder among human
juSt
after the flood: God says
Whoever sheds the blood of man; by man shall his
blood be shed; for God made man in his Own image
(Gen. 9.6) . Even though
men are sinful, there is still enough likeness to God
remaining
in them that to
murder another person (to "shed blood" is an Old Testament expression for
taking
human life) is tO attack the part of creation that most resembles God,
and it betrays an attempt or desire (if one were able) to attack God himself:
Man is still in God's image
The New Testament gives confirmation to this
when James 3.9 says that men generally; not just believers, "are made in the
likeness of God:
However; since man has sinned, he is certainly not as fully like God as he was
before_
His mora
purity has been lost and his sinful character certainly does
not reflect God's holiness. His intellect is corrupted by falsehood and
misunderstanding;
his speech no longer continually glorifies God; his
relationships are often governed by selfishness rather than love
and SO forth_
Though man is still in the image of God
in every aspect of life some
that image have been distorted or lost: In short; "God made man upright; but
they have sought out many devices" (Eccl. 7.29). After the fall, then, we are
still in God's image
are still like God and we still represent God-
but
the image of God in uS
distorted; we are less fully like God than we were
before the entrance of sin.
Therefore it is important that we understand the full meaning of the image of
God not simply from observation of human beings a5
currently exist; but
from the biblical indications of the nature of Adam and Eve when God
created them and when all that God had made was
good" (Gen. 1.31)
true nature of man in the image of God was also seen in the earthly life of
Christ The full measure of the excellence of our humanity will not be seen
in life on earth until Christ retums and we have obtained all the benefits
of the salvation he earned for uS
3. Redemption in Christ:
Progressive Recovering of More of God"s
Image: Nonetheless, it is encouraging to turn t0 the New Testament and see
that our redemption in Christ means that we can, even in this life,

progressively grow into more and more likeness to God_
For example
Paul
says that as Christians we have
new nature that is "being renewed in
knowledge after the image of its creator" (Col. 3.10). As we gain in true
understanding of God, his Word_
and his world, we begin to think more and
more of the thoughts that God himself thinks_
In this way we are

and we become more like God in

So Paul also can say
that we

being changed into his likeness [lit "image;
Gk eikon] from
one degree of glory
another" (2 Cor: 3.18).
Throughout this life, as we
grow in Christian maturity
grow in greater likeness to God. More
particularly; we grow in likeness to Christ in our lives and in our character: In
fact, the goal for which God has redeemed us is that we might be
conformed
the image of his Son"
(Rom: 8.29) and thus be exactly like Christ in our
moral character:
4. At Christ's Return: Complete Restoration of God'$ Image: The
amazing promise of the New Testament is that just as we have been like
Adam (subject to death and sin), we shall also be like Christ (morally pure
neven
subject
death
again): "Just as we have borne the image of the man of
shall also bear the image of the man of heaven" (1 Cor: 15.49).
The
full measure of our creation in the image of God is not seen in the life of
Adam who sinned_
is iL seen in Our lives nOW; for we are imperfect But
the New Testament emphasizes that God $ purpose
creating man in his
image was completely realized in the person of Jesus Christ: He himself "is
the image of God" (2 Cor: 44 NASB); "He is the image of the invisible God"
(Col: 1:15). In Jesus we see human likeness tO God as it was intended to be;
and it should cause US tO rejoice that God has predestined us "to be conformed
to the image of his son
(Rom: 8.29; cf:
Cor: 15.49): "When he appears we
shall be like him"
John 3.2).
Specific Aspects of Our Likeness to God: Though we have argued above
that it would be difficult to define all the ways in which we are like God, we
can nevertheless mention several aspects
existence that show uS t0 be
more
like God than all the rest of creation.
Moral Aspects: (1) We are creatures who are morally accountable before
God for our actions
Corresponding
to thal
accountability; we have
inner sense of
right and wrong that sets US apart from animals (who have little
if any innate sense of morality Or justice but simply respond
tear of
punishment or hope of reward) When we act according to God's moral
standards
our likeness t0 God is reflected in (3) behavior that is holy and
our
dust;
nor
OM
Itom
righteous before him;
by contrast; our unlikeness
God is reflected
whenever we sin:
b. Spiritual Aspects: (4) We have not only physical bodies but also
immaterial spirits; and we can therefore act in ways that are significant in the
immaterial, spiritual realm of existence. This means that We have (5)
spiritual life that enables uS t0 relate t0 God as persons_
pray and praise
him, and to hear him speaking his words t0 US_
No animal will ever spend
an hour in intercessory prayer for the salvation of
relative or
friend!
Connected with this spiritual life is the fact that we have (6) immortality; we
will nor cease t0 exist but will live forever
Mental Aspects: (7) We have an ability to reason and think logically and
leam that sets us apart from the animal world_
Animals sometimes exhibit
remarkable behavior in
solving mazes 01
ouL
problems in the
physical world
but they certainly d not engage in abstract reasoning
there
is no such thing as the
~history of canine philosophy;
tor example, nor have
any animals since creation developed at all in their understanding of ethical
problems or use of philosophical concepts_
etc. No group of chimpanzees will
ever sit around the table arguing about the doctrine of the Trinity Or the
relative merits of Calvinism 01
Arminianism! In
even in developing
physicab
and technical skills we are far different from animals: beavers still
build the same kind of dams they have built for
thousand generations, birds
still build the same kind of nests_
and bees still build the same kinds of hives_
But we continue tO develop greater skill and complexity in technology; in
agriculture; in science
and
nearly every field of endeavor:
Our use of complex, abstract language sets us far apart from the animals_
could tell my sOn, when he was four years old, tO g0 and get the big; red
screwdriver from my workbench in the basement. Even if he had never seen
before_
he could easily perform the task because he knew meanings of
get;
"big_
"red
screwdriver;
workbench;
and "basement.-
He could
have done the same for
small, brown hammer 0F
black bucker beside the
workbench 0r any of dozens of other items that he perhaps had never seen
before but could visualize when
described them in
tew brief words_
No
chimpanzee in all history has been able to perform such
task
task thar
has not been learned through repetition with reward, but is simply described
in words that refer t0 an item that the hearer has never seen before. Yet four-
year-old human beings can do this routinely; and we think
of it. Most
eight-year-olds can write an understandable letter t0 their
grandparents
describing
trip tO the z00,
move
foreign country and learn any
other language
the world_
and we think
entirely normal:
But n0 animal
but,
working
facl,
nothing
will ever write such
letter t0 its
grandparents_
give the past, present; and
future of even one French verb, r read
detective stOry and understand iL, or
understand the meaning of even one verse from the Bible. Human children do
all these
readily; and in s0
show themselves s0 far
superior to the whole animal kingdom that we wonder why people have
sometimes thought that we are merely another kind of animal:
Another mentab
difference between humans and animals is that we have an
awareness of the distant future,
even an inward sense that we will live beyond
the time of our physical death,
sense that gives many people
desire
attempt to be right with God before
die (God "has put eternity into man $
mind,
Eccl. %11).
(10) Our
God is also seen
our human creativity
dreds
such as
art, music
and literature_
and in scientific and technological inventiveness_
We should not think of such creativity as restricted t0 world-famous
musicians 0r artists
is also reflected in
delightful way in the play acting
or skits put on by children_
in the skill reflected in the
meal 0r
the decorating of
home or the planting of .
garden, and in the inventiveness
shown Dy
human being who "fixes
something that just wasn
working
correctly:
The
foregoing aspects of likeness to God have been ways in which we differ
from animals absolutely; not merely
degree_
But there are other areas where
differ trom animals in
significant degree; and these also can show our
likeness t0 God.
(11) In the area of emotions, our
God is seen in _
large difference
in degree and complexity of emotions:
Of course, animals do show some
emotions (anyone who has owned
dog
remember evident expressions of
sadness_
fear of punishment when
has done wrong; anger if another
animal invades its "turf;
contentment; and affection; for example). But in the
complexity of emotions that we experience, once again we are far different
than the rest of creation: After watching my son
baseball game_
can
simultaneously tee
sad that his team lost, happy that he played well, proud
that he was
sport, thankful to God for giving me
son and giving me
the joy of
watching him grow Up, joyful because of the Song of praise that has
been
in my mind all afternoon
and anxious because we are
going
be late for dinner: It is
doubtful that an animal experiences anything
approaching this complexity of emotional feeling
d. Relational Aspects: In addition t0 our unique ability t0 relate to God
things
quite
doing
they
they
likeness
cooking
every
likeness
joy,
good
echoing
very
(discussed above) , there are other relational aspects of
in God $ image_
(12) Although animals no doubt have some sense of community with each
other; the depth of interpersonal harmony experienced in human marriage, in
human family when it functions according to God $ principles, and in
church when
community of believers is walking
fellowship with the Lord
and with each other; is much greater than the interpersonal harmony
experienced by any animals
In our family relationships and in the church; we
are also
superior
angels
who do not marry or bear children or live in the
company of God'$ redeemed sons and daughters_
(13) In mariage itself we reflect the nature of God in the fact that as men and
women we have equality in importance but difference in roles from the time
that God created us (see discussion
chaprer 22).
(14) Man is like God also in his relationship to the rest of creation.
Specifically; man has been given the right to rule over the creation and when
Christ returns will even be given authority t0 sit in judgment over
Cor: 6.3; Gen. 1.26, 28; Ps. 8.6-8).
Physical Aspects: Is there any sense in which our human bodies are also
part of what
means t0 be made in the image of God? Certainly we should
not think that OuI
physical bodies imply that God himself has
body; for
"God is spirit" (John 4.24), and
is sin t0 think of him or t0 portray him in
any way that would imply that he has
material 0r
physica_
body (see Ex:
20.4; Ps_
115.3
Rom: 1.23).
But even though our physical bodies should
in no way be taken t0 imply that God has
physical body; are there still some
ways in which our bodies reflect something of God's own character and
thereby constitute
ot what
means
be created in the image of God?
Certainly this is tnue in some respects.
For example, our physica_
bodies give
uS the ability t0 see with our eyes. This is
Godlike quality because God
himself sees_
and sees far more than we will ever see, although he does not do
it with physical eyes like we have_
Our ears give uS the ability to
and
this is
Godlike ability; even though God does not have physical ears
Our
mouths give us the ability t0 speak; reflecting the fact that God is
God who
speaks
Our senses of taste and touch and smell give US the ability
understand and enjoy God $ creation
reflecting the fact that God himself
understands and enjoys his creation, though in
far greater sense than we do_
It is important that we recognize that it is man himself who is created in the
image of God, not just his spirit or his mind. Certainly our physical bodies are
important part of 0ur existence and_
as transformed when Christ
returns , they will continue t0 be
of our existence for all eternity (see
being
angels
patt
heal,
very
part
Cor: 15.43-45,51-55). Our bodies therefore have been created by God as
suitable instruments tO represent in
physical way our human nature, which
has been made t0 be like God $ own nature.
In fact; almost everything we do
is done by means of the use of our physical bodies
our
thinking;
our moral
judgments
OUI prayer and praise;
demonstrations of love and concern for
each other
all are done using the physical bodies God has given US_
Therefore
if we are careful to point out that we are not saying that God has
physical body; we may say that (15) our physical bodies in various ways
reflect something of God s own character as well_
Moreover; much physical
movement and demonstration of God-given skill comes about through the use
of our body: And certainly (16) the
God-given physical ability to bear and
raise children who are like ourselves
Isee
Gen: 5.3) is
reflection of God $
own ability to create human beings who are like himself:
Especially in the last several points_
these differences between human
and the rest of creation are nOt absolute differences but often differences of
great degree.
We mentioned that there
some kind of emotion
experienced by animals.
There is some experience of authority
relationships where animal communities have leaders whose authority
accepted by the others in the group. Moreover; there is some similarity even
in those differences we think more absolute: animals are able t0 reason t0
some extent and can communicate with each other in various ways that in
SUME
primitive sense can be called
"language
This should not be surprising:
if God made the entire creation s0 that
reflects his character
various
ways, this
what we would expect: In
the more complex and highly
developed animals are more like God than lower forms of animals
Therefore
should not say that only man reflects any likeness t0 God at all, for in one
way O1 another all of creation reflects some likeness
God.
But ic is still
important
recognize that only man, out of all of creation; is so like God that
he can be said to be "in the image of God.
This scriptural affirmation,
together with the scriptural commands that we are t0 imitate God in our lives
(Eph: 5.1;
Peter 1:16), and the observable facts that we can recognize in
looking at ourselves and the rest of creation, all indicate that
are much
more like God than all the rest of creation:
some respects the differences
are absolute; and in other respects
are relative, but
are all
significant:
Finally; our appreciation of the ways in which we are
God can be
enhanced by the realization that; unlike the rest of God's creation
have an
ability t0 grow t0 become more like God throughout our lives:
Our moral
sense can be more
highly developed through study of Scripture and prayer:
Our moral behavior can reflect more and more the holiness of God
Cor:
OI
beings
very
fact,
they
they
like
7:1;
Peter 1.16; et al.) Our spiritual
life can be enriched and deepened. Our
use of reason and language can become more accurate and truthful and more
honoring to God. Our sense of the future can become intensified as we grow
in our hope of living with God forever: Our future existence can be enriched
as we lay up treasures in heaven and seek for increased heavenly reward (see
Matt_ 6.19-21;
Cor: 3.10-15; 2 Cor: 5.10). Our ability t0 rule over the
creation can be extended by faithful use of the gifts God has given uS; our
faithfulness t0 the
God-given purposes for Our creation as men and women
can be increased as we follow biblical principles in our families; Our
creativity can be employed
ways that are more and more pleasing to God;
emotions can be more and more conformed to the pattern of Scripture 50
that we become more like David,
man after God'$ own heart
Sam: 13.14).
Our interpersonaE
harmony in our families and in the church can reflect more
and more the unity that exists among the persons in the Trinity As we
consciously seek tO grow into greater likeness t0 God in all these areas_
also demonstrate an ability that itself sets US apart from the rest of creation:
Our Great Dignity as Bearers of God's Image: It would be good for US tO
reflect on our likeness t0 God more often.
will probably amaze uS tO realize
that when the Creator of the universe wanted

something more like himself than all the rest of creation, he made uS
This realization will give 4S

we reflect on the excellence of all the rest of God'$ creation: the stany

we are more like our Creator
than any of these
We are the culmination of God $ infinitely wise and
skillful work of creation
Even though sin has greatly marred that likeness_
nonetheless now reflect much of it and shall even more as we grOw in
likeness t0 Christ:
Yet we must remember that even fallen, sinful man has the status of being in
God'$ image (see discussion of Gen. 9.6, above): Every single human being_
no matter how much the image of God is marred by sin, Or illness

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
According
to Scripture
what should be the major purpose of your life? If
you consider the major commitments 01
of your life at the present
time (with respect t0 friendships, mariage, education, job, use of money;
church relationships
etc:), are you acting as though your
were the
une
that Scripture specifies? Or do you have some other
that you
have acted upon (perhaps without consciously
deciding to do s0)? As
you think about the pattern of most of yOur days, do you think that God
delights in you and rejoices over you?
How does it make you feel
think that you; as
human
are more
like God than any other creature
the universe? How does that
knowledge make YOu want tO act?
Do you think that there are any more intelligent; more Godlike creatures
anywhere else in the universe? What does the fact that Jesus became
man rather than some other kind of creature say about the importance of
human beings in God s sight?
Do you think that God has made us s0 that we become more happy or
less happy when we grow [0 become more
him? As you look over
the list of ways in which we can be more like God, can yOu name one Or"
two areas in which
growth in likeness to God has given YOu increasing
joy
your life? In which areas would you now
t0 make more
progress in likeness to God?
Is it only Christians O all people who are in the image of God? How
does that make you feel about your relationships to non-Christians?
Do you think an
understanding of the image of God might change the
way YOu think and act toward people who are racially different; or
elderly; or weak; or unattractive t0 the world?

Chapter 22
Man As Male and Female
Why did God create two sexes? Can men and women be equal and
yet have different roles?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We noted in the previous chapter that one aspect of
creation in the
image
God is his creation as male and temale:
So God created man in his
Own
image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created
them
(Gen: 1.27)
The same connection between creation in the image of
God and creation as male and female is made in Genesis 5.1-2, "When God
created man, he made him in the likeness of God
Male and female he created
them_
and he blessed them and named them Man when
Kere
created_
Although the creation of man as male and female
not the only way in which
we are in the image of God_
it is
significant enough aspect of our creation in
the image of God that Scripture mentions it in the very same verse in which
describes God' $ initial creation of man_
We may summarize the ways in
which our creation as male and female represents something of our creation in
God'$ image as follows:
The creation of man as male and female shows God
image in
harmonious interpersonal relationships,
(2) equality in personhood and
importance_
and
difference in role and authority:
Pertcnal Rditcl-Iup:
God did not create human
be isolated persons
uS in
his image, he made us in such
way that we can attain interpersonal unity of
various sorts in all forms of human society. InterpersonaE
unity can be

the human family and also
our" spiritual family, the
church: Between men and women, interpersonal unity comes t0 its fullest
expression in this age in marriage,
where husband and wife become; in
sense, [WO
persons
one:
Therefore
man leaves his father and his mother
and cleaves
his wife; and
become one flesh" (Gen: 2.24). This unity is

not only
physical unity;
is also

and emotional
unity of profound
dimensions.
A husband and wife joined

"God has joined together" (Matt: 19.6). Sexual union with someone other

18-20) , and, within marriage_
husbands and
wives no longer have exclusive rule over their Own bodies, but share them
with their spouses
Cor: 7.3-5) . Husbands "should love their wives aS their
own bodies
(Eph: 5.28).
The union between husband and wife is nOr
temporary but
(Mal. 2.14-16; Rom: 7.2), and it is not trivial but is
profound relationship created by God in order t0 picture the relationship
between Christ and his church (Eph: 5.23-32).
The fact that God created two distinct persons as male and female, rather than
just one man, is
of our being in the image of God because
can be seen
reflect [0 some
degree the plurality of persons within the Trinity. In the
verse prior tO the one that tells
creation as male and female,
we see the
first explicit indication of
plurality of persons within God:
Then God said,
Let US make man in our
image
after our likeness; and ler them have
dominion'
(Gen. 1.26)
There is some similarity here: just as there was
fellowship and communication and sharing of glory among the members of
the Trinity before the world was made (see John 17.5, 24,and chapter 14 on
the Trinity; above), so God made Adam and Eve in such
way [hat they
would share love and communication and mutual giving of honor to one
another in their interpersonal relationship. Of course such reflection of the
Trinity would come
expression in various ways within human society, but
it would certainly exist from the beginning in the close interpersonal unity of
marriage.
Someone might object that such
representation of the plurality of persons in
God is not really
complete one
for God is three persons in one while God
created Adam and Eve as only tWo persons in one. If God intended uS t0
reflect the plurality of persons in the Trinity; why did he not create three
persons rather than two who could reflect the interpersonal unity among the
members of the Trinity? FirSt, we must agree that this fact shows the analogy
between
marriage and the Trinity
be an inexact one. Second, although
cannot be certain of the reasons why God did not do
something when
Scripture does not explicitly tell us those reasons;
we can
suggest tWO
possible answers_
The fact that God is three in one while Adam and Eve
were only tWo in one may be
reminder that God' $ Own excellence is far
greater than ours
that he possesses far greater plurality and far greater unity
than we ourselves_
as creatures,
can possess;
(2) [hough the unity is not
exactly the same, the unity in
family among husband, wife, and children,
marriage
lifelong
pant
does also reflect t0 some
degree the interpersonal
unity yet diversity of
persons among the members of the Trinity:
second objection might be raised from the fact that Jesus himself was
unmarried, that Paul was unmarried at the time he was an apostle (and
perhaps earlier) , and that Paul in
Corinthians 7:1,7-9 seems t0 say that it is
better for Christians not to marry: If marriage is such an important part of Our
reflection of the image of God
then why were Paul and Jesus not married_
and why did Paul encourage others not
be married?
For Jesus, the situation is unique; for he is both God and man, and sovereign
Lord over all creation. Rather than being married to any one individual human
being
he has taken the entire church as his bride (see Eph 5.23-32) and
enjoys with each member of his church
spiritual and emotional
unity that
will last for etemity.
The situation with Paul and his advice
the Corinthian Christians is
somewhat different: There Paul does not say that it is wrong to marry (see
Cor: 7.28, 36), but rather views
something good,
right and
privilege that may be given up for the sake of the kingdom of God: "[ think
that in view of the present distress it is well for
person t0 remain as he is
the
appointed time has grown very short.
For the form of this world is
passing away"
Cor: 7.26
29,31) In this way Paul gives Up one way in
which he might reflect likeness to God (marriage
in order
further other
ways in which he might reflect
God and further God $ purposes in
the world (namely; in his work for the church):
For example, his
evangelism
and discipleship are thought of as bearing "spiritual
children'
and nurturing
them in the Lord (see
Cor: 4.14, where he calls the Corinthians
my beloved
children'
also Gal. 419;
Tim. 1:2; Titus 1:4). Moreover; the entire
up of the church was
process of bringing thousands of people to glorify God
as they reflected his character more fully in their lives_
In addition, we must
realize that marriage is not the only way
which the unity and diversity in
the Trinity can be reflected in our lives. It is also reflected
the union of
believers in the fellowship of the church
and in
genuine church fellowship_
single persons (like Paul and Jesus) as well as those who are married can have
interpersonal relationships that reflect the nature of the Trinity- Therefore;
building the church and increasing its unity and purity also promote the
reflection of God's character in the world

Just as the members of the Trinity are equal in their importance and in their
full existence as distinct persons (see chapter 14, above); So men and women
marriage

have been created by God to be equal in their importance and personhood_
When God created man, he created both "male and female" in his
(Gen: 1.27; 5.1-2). Men and women are made equally in God $ image, and
both men and women reflect God's character in their lives_
This means that
should see aspects of God's character reflected in each other'
lives_
It we
lived in
society consisting of only Christian men or
society consisting of
only Christian women; we would not
full
picture of the character of
God as when
We sef
both
godly men and godly women in their
complementary differences together reflecting the beauty of God $ character:
But if we are equally in God's image, then certainly men and women are
equally important to God and equally valuable to him: We have equal worth
before him for all eternity. The fact that both men and women are said by
Scripture to be "in the image of God" should exclude all feelings of pride or
inferiority and any idea that one sex is "better" or
worse
than the other: In
particular; in contrast
many non-Christian cultures and religions_
n0 one
should feel proud or superior because he is
man, and no one should teel
disappointed
inferior because she
woman_
If God thinks Us to be equal
in value
then that settles the question, for God $ evaluation
the true
standard of persona
value for all eternity:
When in
Corinthians 1:7 Paul says_
man ought not to cover his head_
since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man;
not denying that woman
was created in the image of God_
He is simply saying
that there are
differences berween men and women that should be
reflected in the way they dress and act in the assembled congregation_
One of
those differences is that man in relationship t0 woman has
particular role of
representing God or showing what he
like_
and woman in that relationship
shows the excellence of the man from whom she was created. Yet in both
cases Paul
0n [0
emphasize their interdependence (see
11-12).
Our equality as persons before God
reflecting the equality of persons in the
Trinity, should lead naturally t0 men and women giving honor t0 one another:
Proverbs 31 is
beautiful picture of the honor given to
godly
omal:
A good wife who can find?
She is far more precious than jewels_
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
her husband also
and he praises her:

Many women have done excellently;
but
0u surpass them all:
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
but -
woman who fears the LORD is t0 be praised_
(Prov: 31.10, 28-30)
Similarly, Peter tells husbands that they are to "bestow honor" on their wives
Peter 3.7), and Paul emphasizes_
"In the Lord woman is not independent of
man nOr man of woman; for as woman was made from man;
SO man is nOw
born of woman
(1 Cor: 1.11, 12). Both men and women are equally
important; both depend upon each other; both are worthy of honor:
The equality in personhood with which men and women were created is
emphasized in
new way in the new covenant church:
At Pentecost
see
the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy in which God promises:
will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
and on my menservants and my maidservants in those days
will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:-
(Acts 2.17-18; quoting Joel 2.28-29)
The Holy Spirit is poured out in new pOwer on the church, and men and
women both are given gifts [O minister in remarkable ways Spiritual gifts are
distributed t0 all men and women
beginning
Pentecost and
continuing
throughout the history of the church. Paul
every Christian as
valuable member of the body of Christ; for "tO each is given the manifestation
of the Spirit for the common
(1 Cor: 12.7). After mentioning several
gifts he says
All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who
apportions
each one individually as he wills,
(1 Cor: 12.11). Peter also
many churches throughout Asia Minor; says_
As each has received
gift, employ
for one another; as good stewards of God*s varied grace"
Peter 4.10). These texts do not teach that all believers have the same gifts_
but
they do mean that both men and women will have valuable gifts for the
ministry of the church, and that we should expect that these gifts will be
regards ,
guod"
writing
widely and freely distributed to both men and
women
It seems, therefore_
pointless
ask; "Who can pray more effectively; men Or
women?" 01, "Who can
praise to God better; men Or women?" 0; "Who
will have more spiritual sensitivity and depth of relationship with God?" To
all of these questions_
we simply cannot give an answer: Men and women are
equal in their ability t0 receive the new covenant empowerment of the
Spirit There have been both great men and great women of God throughout
the history of the church. Both men and women have been mighty warriors in
prayer; prevailing over earthly powers and kingdoms and spiritual strongholds
in the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Equality before God is further emphasized in the new covenant church in the
ceremony of baptism:
At Pentecost; both men and women who believed were
baptized: "those who received his word were baptized, and there were added
that day about three thousand souls"
(Acts 2.41). This is significant because
in the old covenant; the sign of membership of God s people was
circumcision, which was given only tO men. The new sign of membership of
God'$ people_
the sign of baptism, given t0 both men and women, is further
evidence that both should be seen as fully and equally members of the people
of God
Equality in status among God's people is also emphasized by Paul in
Galatians: "For as many of yOu as were baptized into Christ have pUE on
Christ
There
neither Jew nor Greek, there
neither slave nor free
there is
neither male nor female;
for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3.27-28)
Paul is here
underlining the fact that no class of people, such as the Jewish
people who had come from Abraham by physical
descent;
the treedmen
who had greater economic and legal power; could claim special status or
privilege in the church. Slaves should not think themselves inferior to free
men Or
women, nor
should the free think themselves superior t0 slaves_
Jews
should not think themselves
superior to Greeks_
nor should Greeks think
themselves inferior t0 Jews. Similarly; Paul wants t0 insure that men will not
adopt some of the attitudes of the surrounding culture
even some of the
attitudes of
first-century Judaism; and think that they have greater importance
than women 0r are of
superior value before God. Nor should women think
themselves inferior 0r less important in the church: Both men and women,
Jews and Greeks_
slaves and free, are equal
in importance and value to God
and
equal in membership in Christ $ body; the church, for all eternity.
In practical terms _
we must never think that there are any second-class
citizens in the church: Whether someone is

rich or poor; healthy or ilL , strong 01
weak, altractive Or unaltractive

equally valuable to God and should be equally valuable to one another as
well: This equality
an amazing and wonderful element of the Christian faith
and sets Christianity apart from almost all religions and societies and cultures
The true dignity of godly manhood and womanhood can be fully realized only
in obedience t0 God $
redeeming wisdom as found in Scripture:

The Relationship Between the Trinity and Male Headship in Marriage:
Between the members of the Trinity there has been equality in importance_
personhood, and deity throughout all eternity. But there have also been
differences in roles between the members of the Trinity God the Father has
always been the Father
and has always related
the Son as
Father relates [0
his Son. Though all three members of the Trinity are equal in power and in all
other attributes_
the Father has
greater authority: He has
leadership role
among all the members of the Trinity that the Son and Holy Spirit do not
have: In creation, the Father speaks and initiates_
but the work of creation is
carried out through the Son and sustained by the continuing presence of the
Holy Spirit (Gen. 11-2; John 1:1-3;
Cor: 8.6; Heb: 1.2). In redemption, the
Father sends the Son into the world, and the Son comes and is obedient to the
Father and dies
pay for our sins (Luke 22.42; Phil. 2.6-8)
After the Son
has ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit comes to
and empower the
church (John 16.7; Acts 1.8; 2.1-36). The Father did not come t0 die for our
sins
nor did the
Spirit The Father was not poured out on the church at
Pentecost in new covenant power; nOr was the Son:
Each member of the
has distinct roles or functions. Differences in roles and authority
between the members of the Trinity are thus completely consistent with equal
importance, personhood, and deity:
If human beings are
reflect the character of God, then
would expect
some similar differences in roles among human beings; even with respect
the most basic of all differences among human
the difference between
male and female. And this
certainly what we find in the biblical
text:
Paul makes this parallel explicit when he says_
want you
understand that
the head of every man is Christ; the head of
woman is her husband, and the
head of Christ is God"
Cor: 11.3). Here is

EQUALITY AND DIFFERENCES
THE TRINIy ARE REFLECTED IN EQUALITY AND
DIFFERENCES IN MARRIAGE
Fiuure 22.1
Just as God the Father has authority over the Son, though the two are equal in
deity; 50 in
mariage, the husband has authority over the wife, though they
are
equal in personhood
In this case, the man' $ role
like that of God the
Father; and the woman
role is parallel t0 that of God the Son They are
in importance, but
have different roles_
In the context of
Corinthians
11.2-16_
Paul sees this as
basis for telling the Corinthians to wear the
different kinds of clothing appropriate for the men and women of that day; SO
that the distinctions between men and
umeM
might be outwardly evident in
the Christian assembly:
2. Indications f Distinct Roles Before the Fall. But were these distinctions
between male and female roles part of God's original creation
Or Were
introduced as part of the punishment of the fall? When God told Eve; "Yet
your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you
(Gen.
3.16) , was that the time when Eve began to be subject t0 Adam
authority?
The idea that differences in authority were introduced only after there Was sin
in the world has been advocated by several writers such as Aida B. Spencer
and Gilbert Bilezikian.
Bilezikian says, "Because
resulted from the Fall,
the rule of Adam over Eve is viewed as satanic in origin, no less than is death
itself "
However; if we examine the text of the creation narrative in Genesis_
we see
several indications of differences in role between Adam and Eve even before
there was sin in the world:
Adam Was Created First; Then Eve:
fact that God first created
Adam, then after
period of time created Eve (Gen. 2.7, 18-23), suggests that
God saw Adam as
leadership role in his family No such tWO-stage
procedure
mentioned for any of the animals God made
but here
seems [0
equal
they
they
The
having -
have
special purpose.
The creation of Adam first is consistent with the Old
Testament pattern of
primogeniture,
the idea that the firstbomn in any
generation in
human family has leadership in the family for that generation.
The right of primogeniture is assumed throughout the Old Testament text;
even when at times because of God'$ special
purposes the birthright is sold or
otherwise transferred t0
younger person (Gen. 25.27-34; 35.23; 38.27-30;
49.3
Deut. 21.15-17;
Chron: 5.1-2). The "birthrighr" belongs to the
firstborn son and is his unless special circumstances intervene [0 change that
fact
The fact that we are correct in seeing
purpose of God in creating
Adam
and that this purpose reflects an abiding distinction in the roles
God has given to men and women, is supported by
Timothy 2.13
where
Paul uses the fact that "Adam was formed first, then Eve"
reason for
restricting some distinct governing and
roles in the church to men:
Eve Was Created as
Helper for Adam: Scripture specifies that God
made Eve for Adam, not Adam for Eve. God said, "It is not good that the man
should be alone;
will make him
helper fit for him " (Gen: 2.18). Paul sees
this as significant enough to base
requirement for differences between men
and
wumCM
worship on it. He says, "Neither was man created for woman;
but woman for man
(1 Cor: 11.9). This should not be taken t0 imply lesser
importance_
but it does indicate that there was
difference in roles from the
beginning:
Recently some writers have denied that the creation of Eve as
helper fit for
Adam signals any difference in role or authority; because the word helper
(Heb
ezer) is often used in the Old Testament of someone who is greater or
more
powerful than the one who is
helped:
In fact; the word helper is
used in the Old Testament of God himself who helps his people:
But the point
is that whenevel
someone "helps'
someone else
whether in the Hebrew Old
Testament 0r in our modem-day use of the word
in the specific task in
view the person who
helping
occupying
subordinate 0r inferior
position
with
regard to the person being helped. That is true even when
"help'
young boy in my neighborhood
fix his bicycle
-it is his
responsibility; and
his task, and
am only giving some assistance a5 needed; it is not my
responsibility. David Clines concludes that this is the case throughout the
Hebrew Old Testament:
What
conclude
from viewing all of the occurrences in the Hebrew
Bible, is that though superiors may help inferiors, strong may help
weak,
many help humans
in the act of helping they are being
"inferior:
That is to say; they are subjecting themselves to
firsc;
teaching
being
help,
Eods
secondary; subordinate position. Their help may be necessary Or
crucial, but they are assisting some task that is someone else $
responsibility: They are not actually doing the task themselves, or"
even in cooperation_
for there is different language for that: Being
helper is not =
Hebrew way of being an equal.
Another objection is that the Hebrew term translated "fit for" in Genesis 2.18
implies that Eve was actually superior t0 Adam; because the term really
means "in front of.
But Raymond C
Ortlund correctly points out that the
Hebrew term cannot mean
'superior t0
or Psalm 119.168 would have the
psalmist saying to God_
All my ways are superior t0
It simply means
corresponding t0.
Adam Named Eve: The fact that Adam gave names
all the animals
(Gen. 2.19-20) indicated Adam'$ authority over the animal kingdom, because
in Old Testament thought the right tO name someone implied authority over
that person (this is seen both when God gives names
people such as
Abraham and Sarah, and when parents give names to their children). Since
Hebrew name designated the character Or function of someone
Adam was
specifying the characteristics Or functions of the animals he named. Therefore
when Adam named Eve by saying
She shall be called Woman, because she
was [aken ouI
Man'
(Gen: 2.23), it indicated
leadership role on his part as
well:
This is true before the fall; where Adam names his wife "Woman_
and it is true after the fall as well, when
Mam
called his wife
name Eve,
because she was the mother of all living" (Gen. 3.20).
Some have objected
that Adam doesn t really name
Eve before the fall:
But certainly calling his
wife "Woman
(Gen: 2.23), just as he called all the living creatures by their
names (Gen: 2.19-20), is giving her
name
The fact that mothers sometimes
give their children names in the Old Testament does not contradict the idea of
name-giving as representing authority; since both mothers and fathers have
parental authority over their children.
d. God Named the Human Race "Man;
Not
Woman'
The fact that God
named the human race
man;
rather than
woman
01 some
gender-neutral
term was explained in chapter 21_
Genesis 5.2 specifies that "in the day
when they were created" (NASB) God
named them Man.
The naming of
the human race with
TET
that also referred t0 Adam
particular; 0r man in
distinction from woman, suggests
leadership role belonging to the man_
This
is similar t0 the custom of
woman taking the last name of the man when she
Jou
~"the
marries:
signifies his headship in the family:
The Serpent Came to Eve First: Satan, after he had sinned_
was
attempting
distort and undermine
everything that God had planned and
created as
good. It is likely that Satan (in the form of a serpent), in
approaching Eve first, was attempting t0 institute
role reversal by tempting
Eve t0 take the leadership in disobeying God (Gen. 3.1) This stands in
contrast t0 the way God approached them; for when God
to them, he
spoke [0
Adam first (Gen. 2.15-17; 39). Paul seems to have this role reversal
in mind when he says
Adam was not deceived
but the
woman was deceived
and became
transgressor" (1 Tim: 2.14).
This at least suggests that Satan
was trying tO undermine the pattern of male leadership that God had
established in the marriage by going first tO the woman:
God Spoke to Adam First After the Fall: Just as God
to Adam on
his Own even before Eve was created (Gen: 2.15-17) , s0_
after the fall, even
though Eve had sinned first; God came first t0 Adam and called him t0
aCcouni
for his actions: "But the LORD God called t0 the man, and said t0
'Where are you?'
(Gen: 3.9). God thought of Adam as the leader of his
family, the one to be called t0 account first for what had happened in the
family It is significant that though this is after sin has occurred, it is before
the statement [0
"He shall nule over you" in Genesis 3.16
where some
wrilerS
today claim male headship in the family began:
g. Adam; Not Eve; Represented the Human Race: Even though Eve sinned
first (Gen. 3.6)_
we are counted sinful because of Adam'$ sin; not because of
Eve $ sin: The New Testament tells uS, " In Adam all die'
(1Cor 15.22; cf:
49) , and,
Many died through one man $ trespass'
(Rom: 5.15; cf: vv 12-21).
This indicates that God had given Adam headship or leadership with respect
[0 the human race_
role that was not given to Eve.
h: The Curse Brought -
Distortion of Previous Roles, Not the
Introduction of New Roles: In the punishments God gave t0 Adam and Eve_
he did not introduce new roles or functions, but simply introduced pain and
distortion into the functions they previously had: Thus_
Adam would still have
primary responsibility for tilling the ground and raising crops, but the ground
would
forth "thorns and thistles" and in the swear of his face he would
eat bread (Gen. 3.18, 19). Similarly; Eve would still have the responsibility of
bearing children; but to do so would become painful: "In pain you shall bring
forth children" (Gen: 3.16).
Then God also introduced conflict and pain into
the previously harmonious relationship between Adam and Eve.
God said [0
Eve;
Your desire shall be for your husband_
and he shall rule over
spoke
spoke
him,
Eve.
bring
you"
(Gen: 316)
Susan Foh has effectively argued that the word translated
desire
(Heb: teshiiqah) means
desire t0 conquer;
and that
indicates Eve
would have
wrongful desire to usurp authority over her husband.
If this
understanding of the word
desire" is correct; as
seems [0 be
then it would
indicate that God is introducing
conflict into the relationship between Adam
and Eve and
desire on Eve'
pait t0 rebel
against Adam'$ authority:
Concemning Adam, God told Eve; "He shall rule over
(Gen. 3.16). Here
the word
nle" (Heb. mashal) is
strong term usually used of monarchical
governments;
nol
generally of authority within
family:
The word certainly
does not imply any "participatory" government by those who are ruled, but
rather has nuances of dictatorial or absolute, uncaring use of authority, rather
than considerate, thoughtful rule. It suggests harshness rather than kindness_
The sense here is that Adam will misuse his authority by ruling harshly over
his wife
introducing pain and conflict into
relationship that was
previously harmonious_
not that Adam had no authority before the fall; it
is simply that he will misuse it after the fall:
So in both cases
the curse brought
distortion of Adam' s humble_
considerate leadership and Eve's intelligent; willing submission t0 that
leadership which existed before the fall.
Redemption in Christ Reaffirms the Creation Order: If the previous
argument about the distortion of roles introduced at the fall
correct; then
what we would expect t0 find in the New Testament is an undoing of the
painful aspects of the relationship that resulted from sin and the curse
We
would expect that in Christ, redemption would encourage wives nOt to rebel
against their husbands' authority and would encourage husbands nOt to use
their authority harshly. In fact; that is indeed what we do find:
wives;

your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord_
Husbands, love your wives
and do not be harsh with them" (Col. 318-19; cf: Eph: 5.22-33
Titus 2.5;
Peter %1-7). If it were
sinful pattern for wives to be subject to their
husbands' authority; Peter and Paul would not have commanded it to be
maintained in Christian
marriages! They do not say; for example,
Encourage
thorns
grow in your
"Make childbirth as painful as possible;
alienated from God, cut off from fellowship with him! " The redemption
of Christ is aimed at removing the results of sin and of the fall in every way:
"The reason the Son of God appeared was t0 destroy the works of the devil"
John 3.8). New Testament commands concerning marriage do nor
perpetuate any elements of the curse 0r any sinful behavior patterns_
rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there from the

beginning of God'$ good creation.
In terms of practical application; as
grow in maturity in Christ, we
Will
grow t0 delight in and rejoice in the God-ordained and wisely created
differences in roles within the human family. When we understand this
biblical teaching; both men and women should be able t0 say in their hearts,_
"This is what God has planned
and it is beautiful and right, and
rejoice in
the way he has made me and the distinct role he has given mej
There is
eternal beauty and dignity and rightness in this differentiation in roles both
within the [rinity and within the human family
With no sense of "better" 0r
"worse
and with no sense of
more important" or "less important;
both
men and women should be able to rejoice fully in the way

made by God:
3. Ephesians 5.21-33 and the Question of Mutual Submission: In
Ephesians
read:
Wives, be subject t0
husbands_
as t0 the Lord. For the husband is
the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church_
his body; and
is himself its Savior: As the church is subject to Christ; so let wives
also be subject in everything to their husbands. (Eph 5.22-24)
While on the surface this would seem t0 confirm what we have argued above
about the creation order for marriage
in recent years there has been some
debate over the meaning of the verb "be subject to" (Gk: hypotasso) in this
passage
Some people have understood it t0 mean "be thoughtful and
considerate; act in love [toward one another]:
If it is understood in this sense_
then the text does not teach thar _
has any unique responsibility
submit
[O her husband
authority; because both husband and wife need [0 be
considerate and loving toward one another; and because according to this
view submission
authority
not seen
this passage.
However; this is nOr
legitimate meaning for the term hypotasso
which
always implies
relationship of submission t0 an authority It is used
elsewhere
the New Testament of the submission of Jesus t0 the authority of
his parents (Luke 2.51); of demons
subject to the disciples (Luke 10.17
clearly the
meaning
act in love, be considerate
cannot fit here); of
citizens being subject to government authorities (Rom: 13.1, 5; Titus 3:1; 1
Peter 2.13); of the universe being subject t0 Christ (1 Cor: 15.27; Eph: 1.22);
of unseen spirituab
powers
subject to Christ (1 Peter 3.22); of Christ
being subject
God the Father (1 Cor: 15.28); of church members being
subject t0 church leaders
Cor: 16.15-16 [see
Clem: 42.4];
Peter 5.5); of
they
youF
wife
being
being
wives
subject to their husbands (Col. 3.18; Titus 2.5;
Peter 3.5; cf.
Eph: 5.22, 24); of the church being subject to Christ
5.24); of servants
being subject to their masters ( Litus 2.9;
Peter 2:18); and of Christians
being subject to God (Heb. 12.9; James 4.7)_
None of these relationships is
ever reversed; that
husbands are never told to be subject (hypotasso) to
wives,
the goverment t0 citizens,
masters
servants, nOr the
disciples to demons, etc. In
the term is used outside the New Testament
describe the submission and obedience of soldiers in an army t0 those of
superior rank
The primary argument that has been used in favor of
"be subject to
the sense "be considerate of" is the use of hypotasso in Ephesians 5.21. There
Paul tells Christians,
Be subject
one another:
Several writers have argued
that this means that every Christian should be subject to every other Christian,
and wives and husbands especially should be "subject to one another:
The
phrase
mutual submission'
has often been used t0 describe this kind of
relationship; and it has been understood t0 imply that there
no unique kind
of submission that
wife Owes t0 her husband:
However; the following context defines what Paul means by "be subject t0
one another" in Ephesians 5.21: he means "Be subject to others in the church
who are in
positions of authority over YOU:
This is explained by what
follows: wives are t0 be subject to husbands (Eph 5.22-24), but husbands are
neven
told to be subject t0 wives. In fact; Paul tells wives to be subject
your own husbands" (Eph: 5.22),
not t0 everyone in the church or to all
husbands! Children are t0 be subject t0 their parents (t0
obey" them; Eph_
6.1-3), but parents are never told to be subject tO 0r t0
their children.
Servants are t0 be subject to ("obey'
their masters, but not masters [0
servants_
Therefore; the idea of mutual submission (in the sense,
everyone
should be subject to everyone
is not affirmed in Ephesians 5.21_
Similarly;
in Colossians 3.18-19 Paul says, "Wives, be subject
your husbands_
as is
fitting
the Lord_
Husbands_
love YOuI wives, and do not be harsh with
them" (see also Titus 2.45;
Peter %.1-7).
Apnlicatio
If our analysis is corect; then there are some practical applications_
particularly within
and also with
regard t0 relationships between
men and women generally:
When husbands begin to act
selfish, harsh; domineering-
or even abusive
being
(Eph:
facl,
taking
obey
marriage,
and chuel ways_
should realize thar this
result of sin
result of the
fall, and is destructive and contrary t0 God $ purposes for them. To act this
way will bring
destructiveness in their
especially in their
marriages_
Husbands must rather fulfill the New Testament commands t0 love
their wives, honor them; be considerate of them, and put them first in their
interests_
Similarly; when wives feel rebellious; resentful of their husband s leadership
in the family, or when they compete with their husbands for leadership in the
family, they should realize that this is
result ot sin;
result of the fall
should not act that way; because O do s0 will
destructive consequences
t0 their
marriages
as well. A wife
t0 act in accordance with God $
pattern should rather be submissive to her husband and agree that he is the
leader in their home and rejoice in that:
Once we have said this_
we MuSL
realize thar there are two other; nearly
opposite
distortions of the biblica
pattern that can occur: If tyranny by the
husband and usurpation of authority by the wife are errors of aggressiveness
there are two other errors, errors of passivity or laziness. For_
husband
the
other extreme from being
domineering "tyrant" is to be entirely passive and
to fail to take initiative in the family
in colloquial terms
to be
'wimp_
this distortion of the biblical pattern;
husband becomes S0
considerate'
his wife that he allows her
make all the decisions and even agrees when she
urges him to do wrong (note this behavior in Adam; Ahab, and Solomon,
among others). Often such
husband is increasingly absent (either physically
emotionally) from the home and occupies his time almost exclusively with
other concems
The
corresponding
error on the part of the wife, opposite of attempting t0
domineer or usurp authority over her husband, is
becoming entirely passive_
contributing nothing to the decision-making process of the family; and being
unwilling
speak words of correction to her husband, even though he is
doing wrong: Submission tO authority does not mean being entirely passive
and agreeing with everything that the person in authority says Or suggests
is certainly not that way when we are submissive t0 the authority ot an
employer or of government officials (we can certainly differ with our
government and still be subject to it); Or even of the authority of the officers
in a church (we can be subject tO them even though we may disagree with
some of their decisions).
wife can certainly be subject to the authority of
her husband and still participate fully in the decision-=
process of the
family:
they
lives;
grear
They
bring
desiring
-making
Husbands
therefore, should aim for
considerate, thoughtful leadership
in their families_
Wives should aim for active, intelligent, joyful submission
their husbands' authority. In avoiding both kinds of mistakes and following
biblical pattem_
husbands and wives will discover true biblical manhood and
womanhood
all of their noble dignity and joyful complementarity; as God
created them to be, and will thus reflect more fully the image of God in their
lives.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
being honest about your feelings
do You think it is better tO be
man Or
woman? Are you happy with the
gender God gave YOU Or
would you rather be
member of the opposite sex? How do you think
God wants YOU
fee_
about that
question?
Can you honestly say that you think members of the opposite sex are
equally valuable in God's sight?
Before reading this chapter; have YOu thought of relationships in the
family as reflecting something of the relationships berween members of
the Trinity? Do you think that is
helpful way of
at the family?
How does that make you feel about YOur Own family relationships? Are
there ways in which you might reflect God s character more fully in your
Uwn
family ?
How does the
of this chapter on differences in roles between
men and women compare with some of the attitudes expressed in society
today? If there are differences between what much of society is teaching
and what Scripture teaches, do you think there will be times when
will
be difficult to follow Scripture? What could your church do to help you
those situations?
Even apart from the questions of marriage Or romantic involvement, do
you think God intends LS tO enjoy times of fellowship with mixed groups
of other Christian men and women? Why do you think God puts in our
heart the desire t0 enjoy such fellowship? Does
also reflect something
of the plurality of persons in the Trinity,
together with the unity of God?
Does this help you understand how it is important that unmarried people
be included fully in the activities of the church? Do you think that in the
some religious groups have tended [0 neglect the importance of this
even
wrongly to forbid such mixed fellowship among Christians?
What are the dangers that should be guarded against in those situations_
however?

The Essential Nature of Man
What does Scripture mean by "soul" and "spirit"?
Are they the same thing?
EXPLANATION
SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Introduction:
Trichommu
Dichotomu and Monism
How many parts are there
man? Everyone agrees that we have
physical bodies. Most people (both Christians and non-Christians)
sense that they also have an immaterial part
soul" that will live
after their bodies die.
But here the agreement ends. Some people believe that in addition
"body
and
soul" we have
third part;
"spirit" that most
directly relates to God. The view that man is made of three parts
(body; soul, and spirit) is called trichotomy ` Though this has been
common view in popular
evangelical Bible teaching, there are few
scholarly defenses of it today:
According
many trichotomists,
man
soul includes his intellect; his emotions
and his will:
They
maintain that all people have such
soul; and that the different
elements of the soul can either serve God or be yielded to sin: They
argue that man' $ spirit is
higher faculty in man that comes alive
when
person becomes
Christian (see Rom: 8.10: "If Christ is in
YOu; although your bodies are dead because of sin,
spirits are
alive because of righteousness
The spirit of
person then would
be that part of
or her that most directly worships and prays
God (see John 4.24; Phil. 3.3).
Others have said that
spirit" is not
separate part of man; but
simply another term for
soul;
and that both terms are used
interchangeably in Scripture to talk about the immaterial part of
man; the part that lives on after our bodies die:
The view that man is
made Up of two parts (body and soullspirit) is called dichotomy:
Those who hold this view often agree that Scripture uses the word
AND
your
hin
spirit (Heb. riach, and Gk pneuma) more frequently when
referring tO our relationship to God, but such usage (they say) is not
uniform, and the word soul is also used in all the ways that spirit
can be used:
Outside the realm of
evangelical thought we find yet another view;
the idea that man cannot exist at all apart from
physical body, and
therefore there can be no separate existence for any
soul" after the
body dies (although this view can allow for the resurrection of the
whole person ar some future time). The view that man is only one
element; and that his body is the person_
is called monism:
According
monism, the scriptural terms soul and spirit are just
other expressions for the
person'
himself, or for the person'$
"life_
This view has nOt
generally been adopted by evangelical
theologians because s0 many scriptural texts seem clearly t0 affirm
that our souls or spirits live on after our bodies die (see Gen: 35.18;
31.5; Luke 23.43, 46; Acts 7.59; Phil. 1.23-24; 2 Cor: 5.8; Heb:
12.23; Rev. 6.9; 20.4; and chapter 42_
on the intermediate state
below)
But the other tWo views continue [0 be held in the Christian world
today. Although dichotomy has been held more commonly through
the history of the church and is far more common among
evangelical scholars today; trichotomy has also had many
supporters_
This chapter will support the dichotomist view that man is [WO

and soul (or spirit), but we shall also examine the
arguments for trichotomy

Before
whether Scripture views
soul" and "spirit" as
distinct parts of man; we must at the outset make it clear that the
emphasis of Scripture is on the overall unity of man as created by
God:
When God made man he "breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became
being" (Gen: 2.7)
Here Adam is
unified person with body and soul living and acting
This
original harmonious and unified state of man will occur again when
Christ returns and we are fully redeemed in our bodies as well as
souls to live with him forever (see
Cor: 15.51-54) . Moreover;
we are t0 grow in holiness and love for God in every aspect of 0uI
body

lives
in our bodies as well as in our spirits or souls (cf:
Cor:
7.34).
We are t0 "cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body
and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God" (2 Cor:
7.1).
But once we have emphasized the fact that God created uS t0 have
unity between body and soul, and that
action we take in this
life is an act of our whole person;
involving to some extent both
body and soul, then we can g0 on
point out that Scripture quite
clearly teaches that there is an immateria
part of man '$ nature_
And
we can investigate what that part is like_
Scripture Uses "Soul" and *Spirit" Interchangeably: When we look at
the usage of the biblical words translated
soul" (Heb_
nephesh and Gk:
psyche) and
spirit" (Heb_
riiach and Gk pneuma),
it appears that
sometimes used interchangeably: For example, in John 12.27
Jesus says;
is my soul troubled
whereas in
similar context in the next
chapter John says that Jesus was
troubled in spirit
(John 13.21). Similarly;
read Mary'$ words in Luke 1:46-47: "My soul magnifies the Lord, and
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior:
This seems to be quite an evident
example of Hebrew parallelism
the poetic device in which the same idea is
repeated using different but synonymous words:
This
interchangeability of
leTS
also explains why people who have died and
heaven or hell can
be called either "spirits
(Heb: 12.23,"the spirits of just men made perfecr" ;
also
Peter 3.19, "spirits in prison
souls
(Rev: 6.9, "the souls of those
who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne
20.4,
'the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony
Jesus" )
At Death, Scripture Says Either That the "Soul" Departs or the
"Spirit" Departs. When Rachel died, Scripture says, "Her soul was departing
(for she died)" (Gen. 35.18) . Elijah prays that the dead child' $
soul" would
come into him again (1
17.21), and Isaiah predicts that the Servant of
the Lord would
WulI
out his soul [Heb. nephesh] to death" (Isa. 53.12). In
the New Testament God tells the rich fool,
night your soul [Gk psyche]
is required of you" (Luke 12.20). On the other hand, sometimes death is
viewed as the returning of the spirit t0 God. So David can
in words later
quoted by Jesus on the cross, "Into your hand
commit my spirit" (Ps. 31.5;
cf: Luke 23.46). At death; "the spirit returns to God who gave it" (Eccl
12.7)_
In the
Testament, When Jesus was dying_
~he bowed his head and
gave up his spirit" (John 19.30) , and likewise Stephen before dying prayed,

(Acts 7.59).
In response t0 these passages
trichotomist might argue that
are
talking about different
for when
person dies both his
soul and his spirit d in fact g0 to heaven. But it should be noted
that Scripture nowhere says that
person $

departed or went [0 heaven 0r were
yielded up to God. If soul and
spirit were separate and distinct
we would expect that such
language would be affirmed somewhere, if only to assure the reader
that no essential part of the person is left behind. Yet we find no
such language: the biblical authors do not seem to care whether
say that the soul departs or the spirit departs at death, for both
seem t0 mean the same thing:
We should also note that these Old Testament verses quoted above
indicate that it is not correct; as some have claimed,
say that the
Old Testament s0 emphasizes the unity of man that it has no
conception of the existence of the soul apart from the body:
Certainly several of these Old Testament passages imply that the
authors recognize that
person continues t0 exist after his 0r her
body dies_
3. Man Is Said to Be Either "Body and Soul" or #Body and Spirit:" Jesus
tells uS not
fear those who "kill the body but cannot
the soul;
but that
should rather
fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matt.
10.28).
Here the word
soul" clearly must refer tO the part of a person that
exists after death: It cannot mean "person" 0r "life,
for it would nOr make
sense to speak of those who "kill the body but cannot kill the person;
who
"kill the body but cannot kill the life,
unless there
some aspect of the
person that lives on after the body
dead. Moreover; when Jesus talks about
soul and body'
he seems quite clearly t0 be
talking about the entire person
even though he does not mention
spirit" as
separate component: 'The word
soul" seems
stand for the entire nonphysical part of man.
On the other hand_
man is sometimes said t0 be
body and spirit
Paul wants the Corinthian church to deliver an erring brother t0
Satan "for the destruction of the flesh; that his spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord Jesus
(1 Cor: 5.5). It is not that Paul has
forgotten the salvation of the man"

word

Moreover; when Paul

approves the woman who is concerned with "how to be holy
body and spirit" (1 Cor: 7.34), and he suggests that this covers the
whole of the person'
life: Even more explicit is
Corinthians 7:.1_
where he says; "let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of
body and spirit; and make holiness perfect in the fear of God.
Cleansing
ourselves from defilement of the
soul" or of the
spirit"
covers the whole immaterial side 0f OuI existence (see also Rom:
8.10;
Cor: 5.3; Col: 2.5).
The
Soul" Can Sin or the *Spirit" Can Sin: Those who hold to
trichotomy will usually agree that the "soul" can sin since they think that the
soul includes the intellect; the emotions, and the
(We see the tact that our
souls can sin implied in verses such as
Peter 1.22; Rev: 18.14.)
The trichotomist; however; generally thinks of the "spirit" as purer
than the soul, and_
when renewed, as free from sin and responsive
t0 the
prompting of the Holy Spirit: This understanding (which
sometimes finds its way into popular Christian preaching and
writing) is not really supported by the biblical text: When Paul
encourages the Corinthians
cleanse themselves
from every
defilement of body and spirit" (2 Cor: 7:1), he clearly implies that
there can be defilement (or sin) in OUr spirits. Similarly, he speaks
of the unmarried
'uMai
who is concerned with how t0 be holy "in
body and spirit" (1 Cor: 7.34).
Other verses speak in similar ways.
For example, the Lord hardened the "spirit" of Sihon the king of
Heshbon (Deut: 2.30). Psalm 78 speaks of the rebellious people of
[srael
'whose spirit was not faithful t0 God" (Ps. 78.8).
"haughty

people t0 be

the ways of
man are pure in his own eyes_
but the LORD weighs
the spirit" (Prov. 16.2) implies that it is possible for our spirits to be
wrong in God'$ sight Other verses imply
possibility of sin in our
spirits (see Ps_
32.2; 51.10) . Finally; the fact that Scripture approves
of one
who rules his spirit" (Prov. 16.32) implies that our spirits
are not simply the spiritually
parts 0f our lives that are [0 be
followed in all cases
but that they can have sinful desires or
directions as well.

Everything That the Spirit Is Said to Do the Soul Is Also Said to Do_
Those who advocate trichotomy face
difficult problem defining clearly just
what the difference is between the soul and the spirit (from their perspective)
If Scripture gave clear support to the idea that OUr spirit is the part of us that
directly relates to God in worship and prayer; while
soul includes our
intellect (thinking), our emotions (feeling), and our will (deciding) , then
trichotomists would have
strong case: However; Scripture appears nOt to
allow such
distinction t0 be made.
On the one hand, the activities of thinking; feeling; and deciding
are not said to be done by our souls only_
Our spirits can also
experience emotions, for example
as when Paul's "spirit was
provoked within him" (Acts 17:16)
Or when Jesus was
troubled in
(John 13.21). It is also possible to have
downcast spirit;
which is the opposite of
cheerful heart" (Prov: 17.22).
Moreover; the functions of knowing; perceiving_
and
thinking are
also said to be done by our spirits
For instance
Mark speaks of
Jesus
perceiving [Gk epiginosko; *knowing
in his spirit" (Mark
2.8). When the Holy Spirit "bears witness with our spirit that we
children of God" (Rom. 8.16), our spirits receive and
understand that witness_
which is certainly
function of knowing
something:
fact; our spirits seem t0 know our
thoughts
deeply, for Paul asks;
What person knows
man'$ thoughts except
the spirit of the man which is in him?" (1 Cor: 2:11). (Cf: Isa. 29.24,
speaking of those who now
err in spirit" but
will come t0
understanding_
The point of these verses is not tO say that it is the spirit rather than
the soul that feels and thinks things
but rather that
soul" and
spirit" are both terms used of the immaterial side of people
generally, and
is difficult t0 see any real
distinction between the
use of the terms_
In fact; we should not slip into the mistake of thinking that certain
activities (such as thinking; feeling; or deciding things
are done Dy
only one part of us. Rather; these activities are done by the whole
person: When we think or feel
certainly our physical bodies

nervous system are involved when we feel

those emotions are involved in physica_

our bodies. This
just t0 reemphasize what was said at the
beginning of our discussion, that the overall focus of Scripture is
primarily on man as
unity, with our physical bodies and the
nonphysical part of our persons functioning together as
unity.
On the other hand, the trichotomist claim that our spirit is that
element of us that relates most directly to God in worship and in
prayer does not seem to be borne out by Scripture.
We often read
about our soul worshiping God and relating to him in other kinds of
spiritual
activity. "To you; 0

"For God alone my soul waits in silence

(Ps. 103.1). "Praise the LORD,
0 my soull" (Ps. 146.1).

magnifies the Lord" (Luke 1:46).
These passages indicate that Our souls can worship God, praise him,
and give thanks to him
Our souls can pray t0 God_
as Hannah
implies when she says, "[ have been pouring out my
Som
before the
LORD"
Sam: 1.15). In
the great commandment is to "love
the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your
might" (Deut: 6.5; cf. Mark 12.30). Our souls can
for God and thirst for him (Ps. 42:1, 2), and can "hope in God"
(Ps. 42.5). Our souls can rejoice and delight in God, for David says_
"My soul shall rejoice in the LORD, exulting in his deliverance'
(Ps.
35.9; cf. Isa. 61:10). The psalmist says,
soul is consumed with
longing for your ordinances at all times
(Ps. 119.20) , and,
My
soul keeps your testimonies-
love them exceedingly" (Ps.
119.167). There seems to be no area of life Or relationship to God in
which Scripture says our spirits are active rather than our souls_
Both terms are used t0 speak of all of the aspects of our relationship
God
However; it would be wrong; in the light of these passages,
suggest that only our souls (or spirits) worship God_
for our bodies
involved in worship as well
We are
unity of body and

brains think about God when we worship
and when we love him with all of our "minds" (Mark 12.30).
David, longing t0 be in God
presence
can say;
My flesh faints
for yOu; as in
dry and weary land where nO water is"
(Ps. 63.1).
Again; we read
"My heart and flesh

(Ps. 84.2). It is obvious that when we pray aloud or
praise [0

God
an act that involves our
physical bodies as well as the
physical materials of which the musical instruments are made (see
Ps. 150.3

In conclusion, Scripture does not seem to support any distinction
between soul and spirit. There does not seem to be
satisfactory

Those who adopt the trichotomist position have appealed to
number of Scripture passages in support of it: We list here the ones
that are most commonly used_
Thessalonians 5.23.
May the God of peace himself sanctify YOu
wholly; and may your spirit and soul and
sound and blameless
at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 5.23).
Does not this verse
clearly
of three parts t0 man?
2. Hebrews 4:12_
"The word of God
living and active, sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit; of joints and
marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart" (Heb. 4.12).
If the sword of Scripture divides soul and spirit; then are these nOt two
separate parts of man?
Corinthians 2:14-3.4. This passage speaks of different kinds of people,
those who are "of the flesh" (Gk sarkinos;
Cor: 31); those who are
'unspiritual" (Gk psychikos, lit.
soul-ish,
Cor: 2.14); and those who are
spiritual" (Gk pneumatikos,
Cor: 2:15). Do not these categories suggest
that there are different sorts of people_
the non-Christians who are "of the
flesh
unspiritual" Christians who follow the desires of their souls_
and
more mature Christians who follow the desires of their spirits? Would this not
suggest that soul and spirit are different elements of Our nature?
Corinthians 14:14. When Paul says; "If [ pray in
tongue, my spirit
prays but my mind is unfruitful"
Cor: 14.14), is he not implying that his
mind does something different from his spirit; and would not this support the
trichotomist'$ argument that our mind and our

The Argument From Personal Experience_
Many trichotomists say that
they have
spiritual perception,
spiritual
awareness of God's presence
which affects them in
way that
know to be different from their ordinary
thinking processes and different from their emotional experiences. They ask;
do not have
spirit that is distinct from my thoughts and my emotions
then what exactly is it that
feel that is different from my thoughts and my
emotions, something that
can only describe as worshiping God in my spirit
and sensing his presence in my
Isn t there something in me that is
more than just my intellect and my emotions and my will, and shouldn 't this
be called my spirit?"
Our Spirit Is What Makes Us Different
Animals. Some
trichotomists argue that both humans and animals have souls, but maintain
that it is the presence of
spirit that makes us different from animals_
7. Our Spirit Is What Comes Alive at Regeneration: Trichotomists also
argue that when we become Christians our spirits come alive:
But if Christ is
in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive
because of righteousness'
(Rom. 8.10).
Now we can consider the seven
points given above:
Kenony
tRninE
Wnchalamt
Thessalonians 5.23. The phrase
YOur spirit and soul and body" is by
itself inconclusive: Paul could be simply piling up synonyms for emphasis_
is sometimes done elsewhere in Scripture_
For example; Jesus says_
"You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart; and with all your soul, and
with all your mind
(Matt: 22.37). Does this mean that the soul is different
from the mind or from the
heart?" The problem
even greater in Mark 12.30:
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart; and with all
soul,
and with all your mind, and with all your strength
If we g0 on the principle
that such lists of terms tell uS about more parts t0 man, then if we also add
spirit t0 this list (and perhaps body as well); we would have five 0r six parts tO
man! But that is certainly
talse conclusion_
It is far better t0 understand
Jesus as simply
piling up roughly synonymous terms for emphasis to
demonstrate that we must love God with all of our being:
Likewise, in
Thessalonians 5.23 Paul is not saying that soul and
spirit are distinct entities
but simply
whatever our immaterial

2. Hebrews 4:12_
This verse, which talks about the Word of God "piercing t0
the division of soul and spirit; of joints and marrow;
is best understood in
way similar t0
Thessalonians 5.23. The author
not saying that the Word of
God can divide
soul from spirit;
but he is using
number of terms (soul,
spirit, joints_
marrow; thoughts and intentions of the heart) that speak of the
deep inward
of our being that are not hidden from the penetrating power
of the Word of God. If we wish tO call these our
soul;
then Scripture pierces
into the midst of ir and divides it and discovers its inmost intentions. If we
wish to call this inmost nonphysical side of our
our
spirit;
then
Scripture penetrates into the midst of it and divides it and knows its deepest
intentions and thoughts. Or if we
wish tO
meraphorically of our inmost
being as hidden in our joints and in the marrow; then we can think of
Scripture being like
sword that divides Our joints Or that pierces deeply into
our bones and even divides the marow in the midst of the bones.
In all of
these cases the Word of God is so powerful that it will search out and expose
all disobedience and lack of submission to God_
In any case, soul and spirit
are not thought of as separate parts-
they are simply additional
terms for our
inmost being:
Corinthians 2:14-3.4. Paul certainly distinguishes
person who is
natural" (psychikos;
soul-ish")

spiritual" (pneumatikos_
"spiritual") in
Corinthians 2.14-3.4.
But in this context "spiritual" seems to
mean "influenced by the Holy Spirit;
since the entire passage is talking about
the work of the Holy Spirit in revealing truth to believers_
In this context;
spiritual'
might almost be translated
Spiritual
But the passage does not
imply that Christians have
spirit whereas non-Christians do not; or that the
spirit of
Christian is alive while the spirit of
non-Christian is not. Paul is
not
talking about different parts of man at all, but about coming under the
influence of the Holy Spirit:
Corinthians 14.14_
when Paul says_
My spirit prays but my mind is
untruicful,
he means he does not understand the content of what he is
praying: He does imply that there is
nonphysical component to his
spirit" within him that can pray to God.
But
nothing in this verse suggests
that he
regards his spirit as different from his soul. Such
misunderstanding

trichotomist
claim that; as we noted above
very difficult to substantiate from Scripture:
Paul probably could equally have said,

The point is simply that there is
nonphysical element
0uI
existence that can
times function apart from our conscious awareness of
how it is functioning:
The Argument From Personal Experience_
Christians have
"spiritual
perception;
an inner awareness of the presence of God experienced
worship and in prayer: At this
inward level we can also at times feel
spiritually troubled, or depressed, 0r perhaps have
sense of the presence of
hostile demonic forces. Often this perception is distinct from Our conscious
rational thought processes_
Paul realizes that at times his spirit prays but his
mind does not understand (1 Cor: 14.14). But does inward spiritual perception
occur in something other than what the Bible calls our

apostle Paul uses the word spirit; but it is simply

terminology
and does not point to
different part of man.
There is a "spirit" within us that
can perceive
in the spiritual realm (note Rom: &.16; also Acts 17:16),
but we could just as well speak of it as Our
soul" and mean the same thing;
for Scripture uses both terms

animals never can. Rather; what makes uS different from animals is the
spiritual abilities that God has given
both our bodies and souls (or spirits)
The question of whether an animal has
soul" simply depends on
how we define soul. If we define
soul" [0 mean "the
intellect;,
emotions, and will;
then we will have t0 conclude that at least the
higher animals have
soul. But if we define OuF
soul" as we have
in this chapter;
mean the immaterial element of our nature that
relates t0 God (Ps. 103.1; Luke 1.46; et al.) and lives forever (Rev:
6.9), then animals do not have
soul: The fact that the Hebrew
deep
soul"?
Mary,
things
word nephesh,
soul;
is sometimes used of animals (Gen: 1.21;
9.4) shows that the word can sometimes simply mean "life"-
it does
not mean that animals have the same kind of soul as man:
7. Does Our Spirit Come Alive at Regeneration? The human spirit is not
something that is dead in an unbeliever but comes
life when someone trusts
in Christ; because the Bible talks about unbelievers having
spirit that is
obviously alive but is in rebellion against God
whether Sihon,
Heshbon (Deut: 2.30: the Lord "hardened his spirit") , or Nebuchadnezzar
(Dan_
5.20:
"his spirit was hardened s0 that he dealt proudly"
or the
unfaithful people of Israel (Ps.
78.8: their
spirit was not faithful to God")
When Paul says, "Your spirits are alive because of righteousness'
(Rom:
8.10) , he apparently means "alive to God
but he does not imply that Our
spirits were completely
dead" before, only that
were
out of
fellowship with God and were dead in that sense.
In the same way;
we a5
whole persons were "dead" in "trespasses and sins" (Eph: 2.1), but we were
made alive t0 God, and we nOw muSt consider ourselves "dead 0 sin and
alive to God" (Rom. 6.11). It is nOt just that one part of uS (called the spirit)
has been made alive; we as whole persons are
new creation'
in Christ (2
Cor: 5.17).
Conclusion. Although the arguments for trichotomy do have some force
none of them provides conclusive evidence that would overcome the wide
testimony of Scripture showing that the terms soul and spirit are frequently
interchangeable and are in many cases synonymous:
We might also note the observation of Louis Berkhof on the origin
of trichotomy:
The tripartite conception of man originated in Greek philosophy;
which conceived of the relation of the body and the spirit of man t0
each other after the
of the mutual relation berween the
material
universe and God. It was thought that, just as the latter could
enter into communion with each other only by means of
third
substance 0r an intermediate
So the former could enter into
mutual vital relationships only by means of
third or intermediate
element; namely; the soul:

escaped from. The danger is to say that the realm of the
spirit" is
the only thing that is really important; with
resultant depreciation
of the value
our physical bodies as created by God and
(Gen. 1.31), and therefore as something t0 be presented t0
God
service for him (Rom: 12.1).
Trichotomy can also have an anti-intellectual
tendency: If we think
of the spirit as that element of us that relates most directly t0 God,
and if we think that the spirit is something distinct from our
intellect, emotions; and will, we can easily fall into an anti-
intellectual kind of Christianity that thinks that vigorous academic
work is somehow
unspiritual"
view that contradicts Jesus
command t0 love God with all our "mind" (Mark 12.30) and Paul $
desire to "take every thought captive t0 obey Christ" (2 Cor: 10.5).
Such
separation of the realm of the
spirit"
from the realm of the
intellect can too easily lead t0
neglect of sound doctrine 0r of the
need fOr extensive [eaching and knowledge of the Word of God
contradiction t0 Paul's
that he would work among God's
people to further both their "faith" and their "knowledge of the
truth which accords with godliness'
(Titus 1.1; cf: v 9). Similarly,
if we think of our spirits as
distinct part of uS that relates most
directly to God, we can easily
begin t0 neglect the role of Bible
study and mature wisdon
making decisions; and place t0O much
reliance on "spiritual" discernment
the realm of guidance, an
emphasis that has, through the history of the church; led many
zealous Christians astray into false
teaching and unwise practices:
Finally; trichotomy can
subtlely influence US to think that our
emotions are not important or not really spiritual, since they are
thought to be part of our soul, not part of out spirit

hold to
view of dichotomy that upholds the

A number of non-Christian philosophers have vigorously

immediately pass into the presence of the Lord_
for he prayed_
"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (Acts 7:59). Paul does not fear
death, for he says,
desire is t0 depart and be with Christ; for
that is far better" (Phil. 1.23). He contrasts that with
remaining in
this life, which he calls "tO remain in the flesh" (Phil. 1.24). In fact;
he says
would rather be away from the body and at home with
the Lord" (2 Cor: 5.8) ,
indicating
confidence that if he were [0 die
physically his spirit would g0 into the Lord'$ presence and there
enjoy fellowship with the Lord at once. The book of Revelation
reminds US that "the souls of those who had been slain for the word
of God and for the witness

(Rev: 6.9) are in heaven
and are able t0 cry out t0 God to

Therefore, although
we mUSI agree

there will be

Christ returns when our spirits will temporarily exist apart from our

ureoacamcuni
What is the origin of our individual souls? Two views have been
common in the history of the church_
Creationism is the view that God creates
et
soul for each person
and sends it to that person's body sometime between conception
and birth. Traducianism, 0n the other hand_
holds that the soul as
well as the body of
child are inherited from the baby'
mother and
father at the time of conception_
Both views have had numerous
defenders in the history of the church; with creationism eventually
becoming the prevailing view in the Roman Catholic Church:
Luther was in favor of traducianism; while Calvin favored
creationism. On the other hand
there are some later Calvinist
theologians such as Jonathan Edwards and A. H: Strong who
favored traducianism (as do most Lutherans today) Creationism
has had many modern evangelical advocates as well.
There is one other popular view called pre-existentianism, namely,
that the souls of people exist in heaven
before their bodies are
conceived in the wombs of their mothers; and that God then brings
the soul
earth tO be joined with the baby'$ body as he or she
"My
"We
they
bring
thal,
together
long
grows in the womb.
But this view is not held by either Roman
Catholic or Protestant
theologians and is dangerously akin to ideas
of reincaration found in Eastern religions_
Moreover; there is no
support for this view in Scripture.
Before we were conceived in the
wombs of our mothers_
we simply did not exist We were nOt. Of
couise _
God looked forward into the future and knew that we would
exist; but that is far removed from saying that we actually did exist
at some
previous time.
Such an idea would tend t0 make uS view
this present life as transitional 0r unimportant and make uS think of
life in the body as less desirable and the bearing and raising of
children as less important:
In favor of traducianism it may be argued that God created man in
his own image (Gen. 1:27) , and this includes
likeness t0 God in
the amazing ability t0
creale
other human
like ourselves.
Therefore, just as the rest of the animal
and plant world bears
descendants
according
their kinds" (Gen: 1.24) ,s0 Adam and
Eve also were able t0 bear children who were like themselves,
with
spiritua
nature as well as
physical body: This would imply that
the spirits or souls of Adam and Eve's children were derived from
Adam and Eve themselves_
Moreover; Scripture sometimes can
speak of descendants being somehow present in the body of
someone in the previous generation, as
the author of Hebrews
says that when Melchizedek met Abraham; "Levi
was still in
the loins of his ancestor" (Heb: 7:10) . Finally; traducianism could
explain how the sins of the parents can be passed on t0 the children
without
making God directly responsible for the creation of
soul
that is sinful or has
disposition that would tend toward sin
However; the biblical arguments in favor of creationism seem t0
speak more directly t0 the issue and give quite strong support for
this view: First; Psalm 127 says that
sons are
heritage from the
LORD_
the fruit of the womb
reward" (Ps. 127.3).
This indicates
that not only the soul
but also the entire person of the child,
including his or her body; is
gift from God. From this standpoint;
seems strange to think of the mother and father as being
responsible by themselves for any aspect of the child $ existence_
Was
not the Lord who, David says, "knit me together in my
mother =
womb'
(Ps. 139.13)? Isaiah says that God gives breath t0
the people on the earth and
spirit to those who walk in it" (Isa_
42.5).
Zechariah talks of God as the one
who forms the spirit of
man within him"
(Zech:
12.1 NIV) The author of Hebrews
beings
when
speaks
of God as "the Father of spirits'
(Heb. 12.9). It is hard to escape the
conclusion from these passages that God is the one who creates our
spirits 0r souls _
Yer we muSt be cautious in
conclusions from this data.
Our
discussion of the doctrine of God $ providence in chapter 16
demonstrated that God usually acts through secondary causes_
God
often brings about the results he seeks through the actions of human
beings_
Centainly this
so in the conception and bearing of
children. Even if we say that God does create individual souls for
human beings before they are born_
and that he is the one who
allows children t0 be conceived and born, we muSt also
recognize
that apart from the
physical union of man and woman in the
conception of
child, no children are born! So we must not make
the mistake of saying that the father and mother have no role in the
creation of the child: Even if we say that God is the
Father of
spirits`
and the Creator of every human soul, just as he is the Maker
and Creator of each of uS_
we must still also affirm that God canries
out this creative activity through the
amazing process of human
procreation. Whether God involves the human mother and father to
some degree in the process of the creation of
soul as well as of
physical body, is impossible for US to say: It is
something that
occurs in the invisible realm of the spirit, which we do not have
information about except from Scripture.
And on this point
Scripture simply does not give us enough information to decide_
However; the arguments listed above in favor of traducianism mus
be said not [0 be very
compelling ones
The fact that Adam and Eve
bear children in their own image (see Gen_
5.3) could suggest that
children somehow inherit
soul from their parents_
but it might also
indicate that God gives an individually created soul to the child and
that that soul is consistent
the hereditary traits and personality
characteristics that God allowed the child t0 have through its
descent from its parents. The idea that Levi was still
the body ot
Abraham (Heb. 7:10) is best understood in
representative, Or
figurative
sense, nOL in
literal sense. Moreover; it is not simply
Levi'$ soul that is talked about in any case, bur Levi himself;
05 9
whole person_
including body and soul
yet Levi's body was
certainly nOt
physically present in any meaningful sense in
Abraham'$ body; for there was no distinct combination of genes at
that time that could be said t0 be Levi and no one else. Finally;
since God brings about events in the physical world that are
drawing
with
consistent with the voluntary activities of human
there does
not seem t0 be any real theological difficulty in saying that God
gives each child
human soul that has tendencies [0 sin that are
similar to the tendencies found in the parents. In
read in the
Ten Commandments of God "visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children t0 the third and the fourth generation of those
who hate [him]" (Ex: 20.5), and, quite apart from the question of
the human soul, we know from human experience that children do
in fact tend t0 imitate both the good and bad traits in their parents'
lives
not only as
result of imitation but also because of hereditary
disposition
For God t0 give each child
human soul that accords
with the imitation of parents that we see in the lives of children
would simply be an indication that God, in creating
human soul,
acts consistently with the way he acts in relation to the human race
in other matters aS well
In conclusion, it seems hard
avoid the testimony of Scripture
the effect that God actively creates each human soul, just as he is
active in all the events of his creation.
But the
degree t0 which he
allows the use of intermediate or secondary causes (that is,
inheritance from parents) is simply not explained for US in
Scripture.
Therefore, it does not seem profitable for us to spend any
[OIE
time speculating on this question
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
In your Own Christian experience, are YOu aware that YOu are more than
juSt
physical body; that you have
nonphysical part that might be
called
soul or spirit? At what times do you especially become aware of
the existence of your spirit? Can you describe what it is like t0 know the
witness of the Holy Spirit with your spirit that you are God's child (Rom:
8.16) , 0r t0 have in your spirit
consciousness of God' $ presence (John
4.23; Phil. 3.3), or t0 be troubled in your spirit (John 12.27; 13.21; Acts
17.16;
Cor: 2.13), 0r o have your spirit worship God (Luke 1.47; Ps.
103.1), 0r t0 love God with all your soul (Mark 12.30)? By contrast, are
there times when you feel spiritually dull or insensitive? Do you think
that one aspect of Christian growth might include an increasing
sensitivity t0 the state of Your soul 0r spirit?
Before reading this chapter; did you hold to dichotomy or trichotomy?
Now what is YOur view? If yOu have changed t0 an acceptance of
dichotomy after
this chapter; do you think YOu will have
higher
appreciation for the activities of your body; yOur mind_
and your
beings;
facl,
reading`
emotions? If you hold to trichotomy; how can YOu guard
some of
the
mentioned in this chapter?
When you are praying 0r singing praise t0 God, is it enough simply to
sing Or speak words, without being aware of what you are saying? Is it
enough to be aware of what you are saying without really meaning it? If
you really mean the words with Your whole being
then what aspects of
your person would be involved in
genuine prayer and worship? Do you
think you tend to neglect one Or another aspect _
times?
Since Scripture encourages US t0 grow in holiness in our bodies as well
as OuI
spirits (2 Cor: 7:1) , what specifically would
mean for YOu t0 be
more obedient t0 that command?

Sin
What is sin? Where did it come from? Do we inherit
sinful
nature from Adam? Do we inherit
from Adam?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Definitian of Sin
The history of the human race as presented in Scripture is primarily
history
of man in
state of sin and rebellion against God and of God $ plan of
redemption t0 bring man back to himself Therefore, it is appropriate nOw t0
consider the nature of the sin that separates man from God_
We may define sin as follows: Sin is any failure to conform [0 the moral law
of God in aCt; attitude, or nature. Sin is here defined in relation to God and
his moral law. Sin includes not only individual acts such as
lying
committing murder; but also attitudes that are contrary to the attitudes God
requires of uS_
We see this already in the Ten Commandments, which not only
prohibit sinful actions but also wrong attitudes:
You shall not covet yOuI
neighbor's house_
You shall not covet your neighbor's wife;
or his manservant
maidservant; his OX Or donkey;
anything that belongs
your neighbor"
(Ex. 20.17 NIV) Here God specifies that
desire [0 steal O1 [0 commit
adultery
also sin in his sight The Sermon on the Mount also prohibits sinful
attitudes such as anger (Matt. 5.22) or lust (Matt: 5.28). Paul lists attitudes
such as
jealousy, anger; and selfishness (Gal. 5.20) as things that are
works of
the flesh opposed t0 the desires of the Spirit (Gal: 5.20). Therefore
life that
pleasing
God is one that has moral purity not only in its actions_
but also
in its desires of heart: In fact, the greatest commandment of all requires that
our heart be filled with an attitude of love for God:
You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart; and with all your soul, and with all your mind,
and with all your strength'
(Mark 12.30).
The definition of sin given above specifies that sin is
failure t0 conform tO
God'$ moral law not only in action and in attitude, but also in our moral
nature. Our very nature, the internal character that is the essence of who we
are as persons
can also be sinful. Before we were redeemed by Christ, not
guilt
stealing
only did we do sinful acts and have sinful attitudes_
we were also sinners by
nature. So Paul can say that "while we were yet sinners Christ died for us'
(Rom: 5.8), 0r that previously "we were by nature children of wrath; like the
rest
of mankind" (Eph 2.3). Even while asleep_
unbeliever; though nor
committing sinful actions 0r actively nurturing sinful attitudes, is still
sinner" in God's sight; he or she still has
sinful nature that does not
conform [0 God'
moral law:
Other definitions of the essential character
of sin have been suggested.
Probably the most common definition is tO say that the essence
sin is
selfishness_
However; such
definition is unsatisfactory because
Scripture itself does not define sin this way: (2) Much self-interest is good and
approved by Scripture, as when Jesus commands us to "lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven" (Matt_ 6.20), or when we seek tO grow in sanctification
and Christian maturity ( 1
Thess. 4.3), or even when
we come to God through
Christ for salvation. God certainly appeals t0 the self-interest of sinful people
when he says
"Tum back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you
die,
0 house of Israel?" (Ezek: 33.11). To define the essential character of sin
as selfishness will lead many people t0 think that they should abandon all
desire for their Own personal benefit; which is certainly contrary to Scripture:
Much sin is not selfishness in the ordinary sense of the term
people can
show selfless devotion t0
talse
or to secular and humanistic
educational
political goals that are contrary t0 Scripture, yet these would
not be due t0 "selfishness"
in any ordinary sense of the word. Moreover;
hatred of God, idolatry; and unbelief are not generally due to selfishness, but
they are very serious sins: (4) Such
definition could suggest that there was
wrongdoing or sinfulness even on God's part; since God s highest
seek his own glory (Isa. 42.8; 43.7, 21; Eph: 1:12).
But such
conclusion is
clearly wrong:
It is far better to define sin in the way Scripture does_
in relationship to God $
law and his moral character: John tells us that
sin is lawlessness"
John
3.4). When Paul seeks t0 demonstrate the universal sinfulness of mankind, he
appeals to the law of God, whether the written law given t0 the Jew (Rom_
2.17-29) or the unwritten
aw that operates in the consciences of Gentiles
who
by their behavior; "show that what the law requires
written on their
hearts" (Rom: 2.15). In each case their sinfulness
demonstrated by their
lack of conformity t0 the mora
law of God_
Finally; we should note that this definition emphasizes the seriousness of sin.
We realize from experience that sin
harmful t0 our lives_
thac
religion '
goal
brings
Pain
and destructive consequences t0 us and to others affected by it: But t0 define
sin as failure tO conform t0 the moral law of God, is t0 say that sin is more
than simply
painful and destructive
it is also wrong in the deepest sense of
the word:
universe created by God, sin ought not t0 be:
Sin is directly
opposite t0 all that is good in the character of God
and just as God
necessarily and eterally delights in himself and in all that he is, so God
necessarily and etemally hates sin: It is, in essence
the contradiction of the
excellence of his moral character:
contradicts his holiness_
and he must hate
Wnemrinn
Where did sin come from? How did it come into the universe? Fitst; We must
clearly affirm that God himself did not sin; and God
not t0 be blamed for
sin. It was man who sinned
and it was
who sinned, and in both cases
they did so by willful, voluntary choice_
To blame God for sin would be
blasphemy against the character of God_
"His work is perfect; for all his ways
are justice_
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he'
(Deut 32.4). Abraham asks with truth and force in his words, "Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen. 18.25). And Elihu rightly says_
"Far be
it from God that he should do wickedness_
and from the Almighty that he
should do wrong
(Job 34.10). In fact; it is impossible for God even to desire
to do wrong: "God cannot be tempted
evil and he himself tempts no
(James 1:13).
Yet; on the other hand, we must guard against an opposite error: it would be
wrong for LS t0 say there is an eternally
evil power in the universe
similar to 0r equal to God himself in power: To say this would be t0 affirm
what is called an ultimate "dualism" in the universe, the existence of tWO
equally ultimate powers_
one
good and the other evil.
Also
we must never
think that sin
surprised God 0r challenged or overcame his omnipotence or his
providential controL
over the universe_
Therefore _
even though we must never
say that God himself sinned or he is t0 be blamed for sin, yet we must also
affirm that the God who
accomplishes all
according
the counsel of
his will" (Eph: 1:11), the God who "does according to his will in the host of
heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or
say to him;
What are you doing?
(Dan 4.35) did ordain that sin would
come into the world, even though he does not delight in it and even though he
ordained that
would come about through the voluntary choices of moral
crealures_
Even before the disobedience of Adam and Eve, sin was present in the
angels
with
ole"
existing
things
angelic
world with the fall of Satan and demons_
But with respect t0 the human race
the first sin was that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Gen 3.1-19).
Their
of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is in
many ways typical of sin generally:
their sin struck at the basis for
knowledge, for it gave
different answer t0 the question; "What is true?"
Whereas God had said that Adam and Eve would die if
ate from the tree
(Gen: 2.17), the serpent said, "You will not die'
(Gen: 34) Eve decided to
doubt the veracity of God '$ word and conduct an experiment [0 see whether
God spoke truthfully
Second
their sin struck at the basis for moral standards
gave
different
answer t0 the question
What is
righr?" God had said that it was morally right
for Adam and Eve not t0 eat from the fruit of that one tree (Gen: 2.17). But
the serpent
suggested that it would be right tO eat of the fruit, and that in
it Adam and Eve would become "like God" (Gen. 3.5). Eve trusted her
UWI
evaluation of what was right and what would be good for her; rather than
allowing God'$ words to define right and wrong_
She
saw thar the tree was
good for food, and that
was
delight to the eyes_
and that the tree was t0 be
desired
make one wise,
and therefore she "took of its fruit and ate'
(Gen:
3.6).
Third, their sin gave
different answer to the question, "Who am I?" The
correct answe
was that Adam and Eve were creatures of God, dependent on
him and always
be subordinate t0 him as their Creator and Lord
But Eve
and then Adam, succumbed to the tempration to "be like God" (Gen: 3.5),
thus attempting t0 put themselves in the place of God.
It is important tO insist on the historical truthfulness of the narrative of the fall
of Adam and Eve: Just as the account of the creation of Adam and Eve is tied
in with the rest of the historical narrative in the book of Genesis,
So also this
account of the fall of man, which follows the history of man'$ creation; is
presented by the author as straightforward_
narrative history: Moreover; the
New Testament authors look back on this account and affirm that "sin came
into the world through one man'
(Rom: 5.12) and insist that "the judgment
following one trespass brought condemnation"
(Rom. 5.16) and that
the
serpent deceived Eve by his cunning" (2 Cor: 11.3; cf:
Tim: 2.14). The
serpent was no doubl;
real, physical serpent; but one that was
talking
because of the empowerment of Satan speaking through
(cf: Gen. 3.15 with
Rom: 16.20; also Num. 22.28-30; Rev: 12.9; 20.2).
Finally, we should note that all sin is ultimately irrational. It really did not
eating
First,

eating
make sense for Satan t0 rebel
God in the expectation of being able t0
exalt himself above God. Nor did it make sense for Adam and Eve t0 think
that there could be any
disobeying the words of their Creator: These
were foolish choices_
The persistence of Satan in
rebelling against God even
today is still
foolish choice; as is the decision on the
of any human
being to continue in
state of rebellion against God. It is not the wise man but
the fool" who
says in his heart;
There is no God'
(Ps. 14.1). It is the
"fool" in the book of Proverbs who recklessly indulges in all kinds of sins
(see Prov 10.23; 12.15; 14.7, 16; 15.5; 18.2; et al.) Though people
sometimes persuade themselves that they have good reasons for sinning;
when examined in the cold light of truth on the last day; it will be seen in
every case that sin ultimately just does not make sense.
The Dcttrine
Inlnted Sin
How does the sin of Adam affect us? Scripture teaches that we inherit sin
from Adam
[WO ways
Inherited Guilt: We Are Counted Guilty Because of Adam's Sin: Paul
explains the effects of Adam'$ sin in the following way:
Therefore
came into the world through one man and death through sin, and s0 death
spread t0 all men because all men sinned" (Rom: 5.12).
The context shows
that Paul is not
talking about actual sins that people commit every day of their
lives, for the entire paragraph (Rom. 5.12-21) is taken up with the
comparison between Adam and Christ: And when Paul says_
"so [Gk houtos;
"thus, in this way'
that is, through Adam $ sin] death spread to all men
because all men sinned,
he is saying that through the sin of Adam "all men
sinned:
This idea
thal
all men sinned" means that God thought of us all as having
sinned when Adam disobeyed, is further indicated by the next [WO verses
where Paul says:
Sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is nOt
counted where there is nO
aw: Yet death reigned from Adam to
Moses_
even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of
Adam, who was
type of the one who was
come. (Rom 5.13-14)
Here Paul points Out that from the time of Adam t0 the time of Moses, people
did not have God s written

infractions of the law), they still died_
The fact that they died is very good
proof that God counted people guilty on the basis of Adam's sin.

The idea that God counted uS
guilty because of Adam's sin
further affirmed
in Romans 5.18-19:
Then as one man
trespass led to condemnation for all men; s0 one
man
act of righteousness leads t0 acquittal and life for all men_
For
as by one man $ disobedience many were made sinners, S0 by one
man
obedience many
be made righteous_
Here Paul says explicitly that through the trespass of one man "many were
made [Gk katestathesan; also an aorist indicative indicating completed past
action] sinners_
When Adam sinned
God thought of all who would descend
from Adam as sinners _
Though we did not yet exist; God, looking into the
and knowing that we would exist, began thinking of us as those who
were guilty like Adam.
is also consistent with Paul'
statement that
"while we were yet sinners Christ died for Us" (Rom: 5.8). Of course
some of
uS did not even exist when Christ died
But God nevertheless
regarded us as
sinners in need of salvation:
The conclusion t0 be drawn from these verses
that all members of the
human race were represented by Adam in the time of testing in the Garden of
Eden:
As 0uI representative
Adam sinned, and God counted us guilty as well
as Adam: (A technical term that is sometimes used in this connection is
impute, meaning "to think of as belonging t0 someone_
and therefore

response
three
things may be said: (1) Everyone who protests that this is
unfair has also voluntarily committed many actual sins for which God also
holds us
guilty These will constitute the primary basis of our judgment on the
last day; for God "will render t0 every man according to his works
(Rom:
2.6), and "the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done
(Col:
3.25). (2) Moreover; some have argued
"Ifany one of uS were in Adam'$
place
also would have sinned as he did, and our subsequent rebellion
against God demonstrates that
think this
probably true, but it does not
seem [0 be
conclusive argument; for it assumes tOO much about what would
or would not happen_
Such uncertainty may not help very much to lessen
someone
sense of unfairness.
The most persuasive answer to the objection is tO point Out that if we think
it is unfair for US to be represented by Adam _
then we should also think it is
unfair for uS to be represented by Christ and to have his righteousness
imputed to us by God_
For the procedure that God used was just the same_
and
that is exactly Paul'
point in Romans 5.12-21:
As by one man'$
disobedience many
made sinners,
by one man's obedience many
be made righteous'
(Rom: 5.19).
Adam, ouI first representative sinned
and
God counted uS
guilty: But Christ, the representative of all who believe in
him, obeyed God perfectly-
and God counted us righteous
That is simply the
way in which God set up the human race t0 work God
regards the human
race a5 an
organic whole
unity, represented by Adam as its head And God
also thinks of the new race of Christians, those who are redeemed by Christ,
as an
organic whole_
unity represented by Christ as head of his people_
Not all
evangelical theologians_
however; agree that we are counted guilty
because of Adam-
sin_
Some, especially Arminian theologians, think this t0
be unfair of God and do not believe that it is taught in Romans
However;
evangelicals of all persuasions do agree that we receive
sinful disposition 0r
tendency to sin as an inheritance from Adam;
subject we shall now
consider:
2. Inherited Corruption: We Have
Sinful Nature Because of Adam' $
Sin: In addition to the legal
that God imputes t0 us because of Adam'$
sin, we also inherit
nature because of Adam'$ sin. This inherited
sinful nature
sometimes simply called
original
sin" and sometimes more
precisely called "original pollution '
have used instead the term "inherited
corruption
because
seems t0 express more clearly the specific idea in view:
Were

sinful
David says,
Behold;
was brought forth in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
conceive me
(Ps. 51.5). Some have mistakenly thought that the sin of
David $ mother is in view here; but this is incorrect; for the entire context has
do with David'$ mother: David is confessing his Own personal sin
throughout this section
He says:
Have mercy 0n me
God
blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
know my transgressions_
Against YOu
have
sinned: (Ps. 51.1-4)
David is S0 overwhelmed with the consciousness of his own sin that as he
looks back on his life he realizes that he was sinful from the beginning_
As far
back as he can think of himself; he realizes that he has had
sinful nature_
fact; when he was born or "brought forth" from his mother
womb, he was
brought forth in iniquity
(Ps. 51.5). Moreover; even before he was born; he
had
sinful disposition: he affirms that at the moment of conception he had
sinful nature
for "in sin did my mother conceive me'
(Ps. 51.5). Here is
strong statement of the inherent tendency t0 sin that attaches t0 our lives from
the very
beginning
A similar idea is affirmed in Psalm 58.3_
The wicked g0
astray from the womb_
they err from their birth, speaking lies_
Therefore
our nature includes
disposition to sin s0 that Paul can affirm that
before we were Christians
were by nature children of wrath, like the rest
of mankind" (Eph. 2.3). Anyone who has raised children can give experiential
testimony t0 the fact that we are all born with
tendency t0 sin_
Children d
not have t0 be taught how tO d wrong; they discover that by themselves.
What we have
do as parents
to teach them how t0 do right; to "bring
them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Eph: 6.4).
This inherited tendency to sin does not mean that human
are all as bad
as they could be. The constraints of civil law, the expectations
family and
society; and the conviction of human conscience (Rom: 2.14-15) all provide
restraining influences on the sinful tendencies in our hearts.
Therefore, by
God'$
common
(that is, by his undeserved favor that is given to all
human
beings) , people have been able to do much good in the areas of
education, the
development of civilization _
scientific and technological
progress_
the development of beauty and skill in the arts_
the development of
nothing
beings
grace'
just laws_
and general
acts ot human benevolence and kindness t0 others_
fact; the more Christian influence there is in
society
general, the more
clearly the influence of
common grace
will be seen in the lives of
unbelievers aS well. But in spite of the ability to do good in many senses of
that word, ur inherited corruption, our tendency t0 sin, which we received
from Adam, means that as far as God is concerned we are not able t0 do
anything that pleases him: This may be seen in tWo ways:
In Our Natures We Totally Lack Spiritual Good Before God: It is not
just that some parts of us are sinful and others are pure. Rather; every part of
0ur
being is affected by sin
OuI intellects_
emotions and desires, our
hearts (the center
desires and decision-making processes_
our
goals
and motives, and even Our physical
bodies
Paul says,
know that nothing
good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh'
(Rom: 7:18) , and;, "t0 the conupt
and unbelieving
pure; their very minds and consciences are
corrupted" (Titus 1:15). Moreover; Jeremiah tells us that
heart is
deceitful above all
and
desperately corrupt; who can understand it?"
(Jer: 17.9). In these passages Scripture is not denying that unbelievers can do
human society
some senses.
But it is denying that they can do any
spiritua
or be
in terms of
relationship with God: Apart from the
work of Christ in our lives
we are like all other unbelievers who are
"darkened in their
understanding; alienated from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, due
their hardness of heart" (Eph. 4.18).
b. In Our Actions We Are Totally Unable to Do Spiritual
Good Before
God: This idea
related to the previous one. Not only do
we as sinners lack
any spiritual
in ourselves
but we also lack the ability to do
anything that
will in itself please God and the ability to come to God in OuI Own strength
Paul says that "those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (Rom: 8.8).
Moreover; in terms of bearing fruit for God's kingdom and doing what
pleases him, Jesus says,
Apart from me YOu can do
(John 15.5). In
unbelievers are not pleasing to God
if for no other reason, simply
because their actions do not proceed
faith in God or from love t0
and
without faith it is impossible to please him" (Heb. 11:6). When Paul '$
readers were unbelievers; he tells them; "You were dead through the
trespasses and sins in which yOu once walked" (Eph: 2.1-2). Unbelievers are
state of bondage Or enslavement to sin, because "every one who commits
sin is
slave to sin" (John 8.34). Though from
human standpoint people
might be able to do much good, Isaiah affirms that "all Our righteous deeds
are like
polluted garment" (Isa.
64.6; cE:
Rom: 3.9-20). Unbelievers are not
even able
understand the things of God correctly; for the
natural
Mam

fact,
from
hin,
not receive the
gifts [lit:
of the Spirit of God, for
are folly t0
him, and he is not able t0 understand them because they are spiritually
discerned" (1 Cor: 2.14 RSV mg:) Nor can we come to God in our own
power; for Jesus says; "No one can come
me unless the Father who sent me
draws him" (John 6.44).
But if we have
total
inability to do any spiritual good in God $ sight; then do
we still have any freedom of choice? Certainly; those who are outside of
Christ do still make voluntary choices
-that is, they decide what they want [0
then they do it In this sense there is still
kind of "freedom
in the
choices that people make:
Yer because of their inability t0 do good and to
escape from their fundamental rebellion against God and their fundamental
preference for sin, unbelievers do not have freedom in the most important
sense of freedom
that is, the freedom t0 do right; and to do what is
pleasing
God:
The application
lives is quite evident: if God gives anyone
desire
repent and trust in Christ; he 0r she should not delay and should not harden
his or her heart (cf: Heb. 3.7-8; 12:17). This ability t0 repent and desire t0
trust in God is not naturally ours but is given by the prompting of the
Spirit, and it will not last forever: "Today; when you hear his voice
do not
harden your hearts" (Heb. 3.15).
FcmiAE
(urTVE
AlI People Are Sinful Before God. Scripture in many places testifies to
the universal sinfulness of mankind_
'They have all gone astray;
are all
alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one'
(Ps. 14.3) David
says, "No man living
righteous before you'
(Ps. 143.2). And Solomon says_
"There
no man who does not sin" (1
8.46; cf: Prov: 20.9).
In the New Testament, Paul has an extensive argument in Romans 1:18-3.20
showing that all people, both Jews and Greeks
stand guilty before God_
says
All men

Does Our Ability Limit Our Responsibility? Pelagius
popular
Christian teacher active in Rome about AD 383-410 and then later (until
AD. 424) in Palestine, taught that God holds man responsible only for those
things that man is able t0 do. Since God warns US to do good, therefore, We
must have the ability to do the good that God commands. The Pelagian
position rejects the doctrine of "inherited sin" (or "original sin"
and
maintains that sin consists only in separate sinful acts.
However; the idea that we are responsible before God only for what we are
able to do is contrary t0 the testimony of Scripture; which affirms both that
were dead through the trespasses and sins'
in which
once walked
(Eph 2:1), and thus unable to do any spiritual good, and also that we are all
guilty before God. Moreover; if Our responsibility before God were limited by
ability, then extremely hardened sinners_
who are in great bondage to sin,
could be less guilty before God than mature Christians who were striving
daily t0
him:
And Satan himself, who
eternally able to do only evil,
would have no
at all
surely an incorrect conclusion.
The true measure of 0ur
responsibility and
is not OUI Own
ability to obey
God
but rather the absolute perfection of God $ moral
law and his Own
holiness (which is reflected in that law) "You; therefore, must be perfect; as
your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt: 5.48).
Are Infants Guilty Before They Commit Actual Sins? Some maintain
that Scripture teaches an
age of accountability" before which young children
not held responsible for sin and are not counted guilty before God
However; the passages noted above in Section € about "inherited sin"
indicate that even before birth children have
guilty standing before God and
sinful nature that not only gives them
tendency
sin but also causes God
[0 view them as "sinners.
"Behold,
was brought forth in iniquity; and in sin
did my mother conceive me
(Ps. 51.5). The passages that speak of final
judgmenc
terms
actual sinful deeds that have been done (eg, , Rom: 2.6_
11) do not say anything about the basis of judgment when there have been no
individuab
actions of right Or wrong
as with children
dying in early infancy:
In such cases we must accept the Scriptures that talk about ourselves as
having
sinful nature from before the time of birth:
Furthermore_
we MUSL
realize that
child's sinful nature manifests itself very early; certainly within
obey
guilt
guilt
the first Iwo years of
child s life, as anyone who has raised children can
affirm: (David says
in another place, "The wicked g0 astray from the womb_
they enr from their birth;
Ps. 58.3.)
But then what do we say about infants who die before
are old enough
understand and believe the gospel? Can they be saved?
Here We must say that if such infants are saved_
it cannot be on their Own
merits,
or on the basis of their own righteousness or innocence; but
must be
entirely on the basis of Christ'$ redemptive work and regeneration by the
work of the Holy Spirit within them. "There is one God, and there is one
mediator berween God and men, the man Christ Jesus
(1 Tim: 2.5). "Unless
one is born anew; he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3.3).
Yet it certainly is possible for God to
regeneration (that is
new spiritual
life) t0 an infant even before he or she
born. This was true of John the
Baptist, for the angel Gabriel, before John was born, said_
~He will be filled
with the Holy Spirit; even from his mother
womb
(Luke 1:15). We might
say that John the Baptist was "born again'
before he was bom! There is
similar example in Psalm 22.10: David says, "Since my mother bore me you
have been my God
It is clear; therefore
that God is able t0 save infants in an
unusual way; apart from their hearing and
understanding
the
gospel, by
bringing regeneration to them very early, sometimes even before birth. This
regeneration
probably also followed at once by
nascent; intuitive
awareness 0f God and trust in him at an extremely early age, but this is
something
we simply cannot understand:
We must, however; affirm very clearly that this is not the usual way for God
LO save people_
Salvation usually occurs when someone hears and understands
the
gospel and then places trust in Christ. But in unusua
cases
like John the
Baptist, God brought salvation before this understanding
And this leads uS
conclude that it certainly is possible that God would also do this where he
knows the infant will die before hearing the gospel.
How many infants does God save in this way? Scripture does not tell us, sO
we simply cannot know: Where Scripture is silent;
is unwise for US [0 make
definitive pronouncements. However; we should recognize that it is God's
frequent pattern throughout Scripture
save the children of those who
believe in him (see Gen. 7:1; cf. Heb: 11:7; Josh: 2.18; Ps. 103.17; John 4.53;
Acts 2.39; 11.140?); 16.31; 18.8;
Cor: 1:16; 7.14; Titus 1:6).
These passages
do not show that God automatically saves the children of all believers (for we
all know of children of godly parents who have grown up and rejected the
they
bring
Lord
and Scripture also gives such examples as Esau and Absalom), but-
do indicate that God's ordinary pattern, the "normal" or expected way in
which he acts, is to bring the children of believers to himself:
believers
children who die very young_
we have no reason [0 think that it
would be otherwise_
Particularly relevant here is the case of the first child Bathsheba bore t0
David.
When the infant child had died,
David said, "[ shall go to
but he
will not return
me"
(2 Sam: 12.23)_
David_
who through his life had such
great confidence that he would live forever in the Lord s presence (see Ps_
23.6, and many of David'$ psalms), also had confidence that he would see his
infant son again when he died
This can only imply that he would be with his
SOn
the presence of the Lord forever:
This passage
with the
others mentioned above, should be of similar assurance t0 all believers who
have
ost children in their infancy; that
will one day see them again in the
glory of the heavenly kingdom:
Regarding the children of unbelievers who die at
very early age Scripture is
silent We simply must
leave that matter in the hands of God and trust him t0
be both just and merciful. If they are saved_
it will not be on the basis of any
merit of their OWn Or any innocence that we might presume that they have. If
they are saved
it will be on the basis of Christ $ redeeming work; and their
regeneration, like that of John the Baptist before he was born,
will be by
God
mercy and grace. Salvation is always because of his mercy; not because
of our merits (see Rom: 9.14-18). Scripture does not allow Us t0 say more
than thal:
Are There Degrees of Sin? Are some sins worse than others? The question
may be answered either yes 0r no, depending on the sense in which it is
intended:
Legal Guilt:
(erms of our
before God, any one sin, even
what may seem tO be a very small one, makes us legally
guilty before God
and therefore worthy of eternal punishment Adam and Eve leamed this in the
Garden of Eden; where God told them that one act of disobedience would
result in the penalty of death (Gen: 2.17)-
And Paul affirms that "the judgment
following one trespass brought condemnation" (Rom: 5.16). This one sin
made Adam and Eve sinners before God
no longer able to stand in his holy
presence_
truth remains valid through the history of the human race. Paul (quoting
Deut: 27.26) affirms it:
Cursed be every one who does not abide by all

Wirh

This `
things written in the book of the law; and do them" (Gal. 3.10). And James
declares:
Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become
guilty
of all of it For he who said, "Do not commit adultery;
said also,
"Do
not kill
If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become
transgressor of the law: (James 2.10-11)
Therefore_
in terms of legal guilt; all sins are equally bad because they make
uS legally guilty before God and constitute 4S as sinners.
Results in Life and in Relationship With God: On the other hand, some
sins are worse than others in that they have more harmfus
consequences in our
lives and in the lives of others_
and_
in terms of our personal relationship to
God as Father; they arouse his displeasure more and bring more serious
disruption
our fellowship with him.
Scripture sometimes speaks of degrees of seriousness of sin. When Jesus
stood before Pontius Pilate
he said
~he who delivered me to you has the
greater sin
(John 19.11). The reference is apparently t0 Judas
who had
known Jesus intimately for three years and yet willfully betrayed him t0
death: Though Pilate had authority over Jesus by virtue of his governmental
office and was wrong
allow an innocent man to be condemned t0 death, the
sin of Judas was far
greater;
probably because of the far greater knowledge
and malice connected with it.
When God showed Ezekiel visions of sins in the temple of Jerusalem, he first
showed Ezekiel certain things
then said, "But you will see still greater
abominations'
(Ezek: 8.6). Next he showed Ezekiel the secret sins of some of
the elders of Israel and said, "You will see still greater abominations which
they
commit" (Ezek 8:13) Then the Lord showed Ezekiel
picture of
WumeIL
weeping for
Babylonian deity and said, "Have YOu seen this,
son
of man? You will see still greater abominations than these
(Ezek: 8.15).
Finally; he showed Ezekie=
twenty-five men in the temple
with their backs t0
the Lord and worshiping the sun instead_
Here clearly we have degrees of
increasing sin and hatefulness before God.
In the Sermon of the Mount; when Jesus says_
Whoever then relaxes one of
the least of these commandments and teaches men SO, shall be called least in
the kingdom of heaven
(Matt: 5.19), he implies that there are lesser and
greater commandments. Similarly; though he agrees that it is appropriate to
give
tithe even on the household spices that people use, he pronounces woes
on the Pharisees for neglecting
the weightier matters of the law, justice and
mercy and faith" (Matt. 23.23). In both cases Jesus distinguishes berween
lesser and greater commandments, thus implying that some sins are worse
than other sins in terms of God $ Own evaluation of their importance:
In general, we may say that some sins have more harmful consequences than
others
they bring more dishonor to God or if they cause more harm tO
ourselves
to others,
Or [0 the church: Moreover; those sins that are done
willfully, repeatedly; and knowingly; with
calloused heart; are more
displeasing t0 God than those that are done out of ignorance and are not
repeated_
0r are done with
mixture of good and impure motives and are
followed by remorse and repentance. Thus the laws that God gave to Moses
in Leviticus make provisions for cases where
sin
unwittingly" (Lev
4.2,13,22). Unintentional sin is still sin: "If any one sins, doing any of the
things which the LORD has commanded not to be done; though he does not
know it, yet he is
guilty and shall bear his iniquity
(Lev: 5.17). Nonetheless,
the penalties required and the degree of God*$ displeasure that results from
the sin are
ess than in the case of intentional sin:
On the other hand, sins committed with
high hand_
that
with arogance
and disdain for God
commandments_
were viewed
seriously: "But the
person who does
anything with
high hand_
whether he is native 0r
sojourner; reviles the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his
people" (Num: 15.30; cf. vv: 27-29).
We can readily see how some sins have much more harmful consequences for
ourselves and others and for our relationship with God. If [ were t0 covet my
neighbor
car; that would be sin before God But if my coveting led me t0
actually steal the car; that would be more serious sin. If in the course of
[he car
also fought with my neighbor and injured him 0r recklessly
injured someone else as
drove the car; that would be even more serious sin:
Similarly, if
new Christian, who previously had
tendency
t0 lose his
temper and get into fights, begins witnessing to his unbelieving friends and,
one day, is so provoked he loses his temper and actually strikes someone
that
is certainly sin in God's sight But if
mature pastor O1 Other prominent
Christian leader were to lose his temper publicly and strike someone; that
would be even more serious in God's sight; both because of the harm that
would come t0 the reputation of the gospel and because those in leadership
positions are held to
higher standard of accountability by God:
We who
teach shall be judged with greater strictness
(James 3.1; cf: Luke 12.48). Our
conclusion, then,
thac
terms
results and
terms of the degree of God $

very
stealing
displeasure,
some
sins are certainly worse than others
However; the distinction between degrees of seriousness 0f sin does nOt imply
an endorsement of the Roman Catholic teaching that sins can be put into the
categories of
venial" and
'mortal.
In Roman Catholic teaching
venial sin can be forgiven, but often after punishments in this life or in
Purgatory (after death, but before entrance into heaven) A mortal sin is
that causes spiritual death and cannot be forgiven;
excludes people from the
kingdom of God.
According
Scripture; however; all sins are
mortal" in that even the
smallest sin makes us legally guilty before God and worthy of eternal
punishment Yet even the most serious of sins
forgiven when one comes
Christ for salvation (note the combination of
list of sins that exclude from
the kingdom of God and the affirmation that the Corinthians who had
committed them have been saved by Christ in
Cor: 6.9-11)_
Thus, in that
sense, all sins are
venial:
The Roman Catholic separation of sins into the
category of
mortal" and
venial,
some sins (such as suicide
mortal;
while calling others (such as dishonesty; anger; or lust) "venial" sins
can very easily lead either to carelessness with respect to some sins that
greatly hinder sanctification and effectiveness in the Lord's work, O;, with
respect t0 Other sins_
excessive fear; despair; and inability ever t0 have
assurance of
forgiveness
And we should realize that the same exact action
(such as losing one
temper and
someone in the example above) can
be more or less serious, depending on the person and circumstances involved
It is much better simply t0 recognize that sins can vary
terms of their
results and
(erms of the
degree to which
disrupt our relationship with
God and incur his displeasure; and leave it at that: Then we do not go beyond
the general teaching of Scripture on this subject:
The distinction that Scripture makes in
degrees of sin does have positive
value. First; it helps US t0 know where we should put more effort in Our Own
attempts tO grow in personal holiness. Second_
helps us t0 decide when we
should simply overlook
minor fault in
friend or family member and when
it would be appropriate t0 talk with an individuaL
about some evident sin (see
James 5.19-20). Third,
may help us decide when church discipline is
appropriate, and
provides an answer t0 the objection that is sometimes
raised
exercising church discipline; in which it is said that
we are all
guilty of sin, SO we have no business
meddling in anyone else
life:
Though
are all indeed guilty of sin, nonetheless; there are some sins that s0
evidently harm the church and relationships within the church that they must

be dealt with directly. Fourth, this distinction may also
uS realize that
there is some basis for civil governments to have laws and penalties
prohibiting certain kinds of wrongdoing (such as murder Or stealing), but not
other kinds of
wrongdoing (such
anger; jealousy; greed, or selfish use of
one
possessions). It is nOt inconsistent [0 say that some kinds of wrongdoing
require civil punishment but not all kinds of wrongdoing require it:
5. What Happens When
Christian Sins?
Our Legal Standing Before God Is Unchanged: Though this subject
could be treated later in relation to adoption or sanctification within the
Christian life, it is quite appropriate [0 treat
at this point:
When
Christian sins, his or her legal standing before God is unchanged_
or she is still forgiven, for
there
therefore nOw no condemnation for those
who are in Christ Jesus'
(Rom: 8.1). Salvation is not based on Our merits but
free gift of God (Rom: 6.23), and Christ's death certainly paid for all our
sins
past; present; and future
Christ died
for our sins
Cor: 15.3),
without distinction. In theological terms_
we still keep our "justification
Moreover; we are still children of God and we still retain our membership in
God's family: In the same epistle in which John says
"If we say we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves_
and the truth in not in us
(1 John 1.8), he also
reminds his readers, "Beloved, we are God' s children now'
(1 John
3.2). The
fact that we have sin remaining in our lives does not mean that we lose our
status as God'$ children. In
theological terms, we keep
adoption.
Our Fellowship With God Is Disrupted and Our Christian Life Is
Damaged: When we sin, even though God does not cease to love uS
he is
displeased with us. (Even among human
it is possible to love someone
and be displeased with that person at the same time, as any parent will attest;
or any wife,
any husband_
Paul tells us that it is possible for Christians t0
the Holy Spirit of God" (Eph: 4.30); when we sin, we cause him
SOITOw and he is displeased with us. The author of Hebrews reminds us that
"the Lord disciplines him whom he loves'
(Heb
12.6, quoting Prov 311 -
12), and that "the Father of spirits
disciplines us for our
that we may
share his holiness'
(Heb. 12.9-10). When we disobey; God the Father is
grieved, much as an earthly father is grieved with his children's disobedience_
and he disciplines 4s.
A similar theme is found in Revelation
where the
risen Christ
from heaven t0 the church of Laodicea
saying
"Those
whom
love

Here again love and reproof of sin are connected in the same statement Thus_

the New 'Testament attests [0 the
leasure of all three members of the
Trinity when Christians sin: (See also Isa. 59.1-2;
John 3.21.)
The Westminster Confession of Faith wisely says
concerning Christians,
Although they
never can fall from the state of justification; yet they
may; by their sins, fall under God's fatherly displeasure, and not have
the light of His countenance restored unto them; until they humble
themselves, confess their sins,
pardon, and renew their faith and
repentance. (chap_
sec; 5)
Hebrews 12, together with many historical examples in Scripture, shows that
God's fatherly displeasure often leads to discipline in our Christian lives: "He
disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness" (Heb. 12:10).
Regarding the need for regular confession and repentance of sin, Jesus
reminds US that we are t0 pray each

When we sin as Christians, it is not only our personal relationship with God
that is disrupted:
Our Christian life and fruitfulness
ministry are also
damaged. Jesus warns US

abides in the vine; neither can you_

and that sin

The Danger of "Unconverted Evangelicals"
While
genuine Christian
who sins does not lose his or her justification or adoption before God (see
above), there needs to be
clear warning that mere association with an
evangelical church and outward conformity to accepted "Christian" patterns
of behavior does not guarantee salvation. Particularly in societies and cultures
where it iS easy (01 even
expected) for people to profess t0 be Christians
there is
possibility that some will associate with the church who are not
genuinely born again: If such people then become more and more disobedient
to Christ in their pattern of life,
should not be lulled into complacency by
assurances that they still have justification or adoption in God' s family. A
consistent pattern of disobedience t0 Christ coupled with
lack ot the
elements of the fruit of the Holy Spirit such as love; joy; peace, and s0 forth
(see Gal: 5.22-23) is
warning signal that the person is probably not
true
Christian inwardly, that there probably has been no genuine heart-faith from
the beginning and no regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus warns that
he will say to some who have prophesied
cast out demons_
and done many
mighty works in his name,
never knew you; depart from me, yu evildoers
(Matt. 7.23). And John tells us that "he who says

speaks of -

question is really
Christian at all
What Is the Unpardonable Sin? Severa
passages of Scripture speak
about
sin that will not be forgiven. Jesus says:
war"
gold,
hay;
they
Therefore
tell you; every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men;
but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And
whoever says
word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but
whoever
against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in
this age Or in the age t0 come_
(Matt: 12.31-32)
A similar statement OcCurs in Mark 3.29-30, where Jesus says that
whoever
blasphemes
the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness
(Mark 3.29; cf:
Luke 12.10). Similarly, Hebrews
says:
For it is impossible to restore again t0 repentance those who have
once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift; and have
become partakers of the Holy Spirit; and have tasted the goodness of
the word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they then
commit apostasy; since they crucify the son of God on their Own
account and hold him up t0 contempt: (Heb: 6.4-6; cf: 10.26-27; also
the discussion of the sin "that leads t0 death" [NIV] in
John 5.16
17)
These passages could be talking about the same or different sins;
decision
about this will have to be made from an examination of the passages in
contexL
Several different views of this sin have been taken
Some have thought that it was
sin that could only be committed while
Christ was 0n earth:
But Jesus' statement that "every sin and blasphemy will
be forgiven men
(Matt: 12.31) is s0 general that it seems unwarranted [0 say
it is only
referring
something that could only happen during his lifetime
the texts in question do not specify such
restriction: Moreover; Hebrews
6.4-6 is speaking of apostasy that has occurred
number of years after Jesus
returned t0 heaven:
2. Some have held that the sin is unbelief that continues until the time of
death; therefore_
everyone who dies in unbelief (or at least everyone who has
heard of Christ and then dies in unbelief) has committed this sin: It is true, of
course, thar those Who
persist in unbelief until death will not be forgiven; but
the question is whether that fact is what is being discussed
these verses
On
close reading of the verses_
that explanation does not seem to fit the language
of the texts cited, for

unbelief that persists until death does not fit well with the context of
rebuke
the Pharisees for what they were saying
both Matthew and Mark (see
discussion of context below)
3. Some hold that this sin is serious apostasy by genuine believers, and that
only those who are truly born
could commit this sin: 'They base their
view on their understanding of the nature of the
apostasy" that is mentioned
in Hebrews 6.4-6 (thar it is
rejection of Christ and loss of salvation by
true
Christian). But that does not seem to be the best understanding of Hebrews
Moreover; though this view could perhaps be sustained with respect
Hebrews
does not explain blasphemy
the Holy Spirit in the
gospel passages, in which Jesus is
responding
the Pharisees' hard-hearted
denial of the work of the
Spirit through him
fourth possibility is that this sin consists of unusually malicious, willful
rejection and slander against the Holy Spirit $ work attesting
Christ; and
attributing that work to Satan:
closer look at the context of Jesus' statement
in Matthew and Mark shows that Jesus
WJS
speaking in response t0 the
accusation of the Pharisees that "it is only by Beelzebul; the prince of
demons_
that this man casts out demons"
(Matt_ 12.24). The Pharisees had
seen Jesus
works repeatedly: He had just healed
blind and dumb demoniac
so that he could see and speak (Matt: 12.22).
The people were amazed and
were following Jesus in large numbers, and the Pharisees themselves had
repeatedly seen clear demonstrations of the amazing power of the
Spirit
through Jesus to bring life and health to many people: But the
Pharisees
in spite of clear demonstrations of the work of the Holy Spirit in
front of their eyes, willfully rejected Jesus
authority and his teaching and
attributed it t0 the devil. Jesus then told them clearly that
'no city 0r house
divided
itself will stand; and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided
himself; how then will his kingdom stand?" (Matt: 12.25-26).
So it
Wds

After explaining; "If it is by the Spirit of God that
cast ouI demons, then the
kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt: 12.28), Jesus declares this
warning: "He who
not with me
me_
and he who does nOt
with me scatters'
(Matt: 12.30). He warns that there
no neutrality; and
certainly those who, like the Pharisees
oppose his message are against him:
Then he immediately adds; "Therefore

the Spirit will not be
forgiven" (Matt: 12.31). The willful, malicious slander of the work of the
Holy Spirit through Jesus
in which the Pharisees attributed
to Satan, would
not be
forgiven.
The context indicates that Jesus is speaking about
sin that is not simply
unbelief or rejection of Christ; but one that includes (1) a clear knowledge of
who Christ
and of the power of the Holy Spirit
through him; (2)
willful rejection of the facts about Christ that his opponents knew to be true,
and
slanderously attributing the work of the Holy Spirit in Christ t0 the
power of Satan. In such
case the hardness of heart would be s0 great that
any ordinary means of
bringing
sinner t0 repentance would already have
been rejected. Persuasion of the truth will not work, for these people have
already known the truth and have willfully rejected it. Demonstration of the
power of the Holy Spirit to heal and
life will not work; for they have
seen
and rejected it. In this case
is not that the sin itself is s0 horrible that
it could not be covered by Christ'$ redemptive work; but rather that the
sinner'$ hardened heart puts him or her beyond the reach of God '$ ordinary
means of
bringing forgiveness through repentance and
Christ for
salvation. The sin is unpardonable because it cuts off the sinner
repentance and saving faith through belief in the truth:
Berkhof wisely defines this sin in the
following way:
sin consists in the conscious, malicious, and wilful rejection and
slander; against evidence and conviction, of the testimony of the Holy
Spirit respecting the grace of God in Christ,
attributing it Out of hatred
and enmity t0 the Prince of Darkness_
in committing that sin man
wilfully; maliciously; and intentionally attributes what is clearly
recognized aS the work of God to the influence and operation of
Satan.
Berkhof explains that the sin itself consists
nOL in
doubting the truth; nor in a
sinful denial of it but in
contradiction of it that goes contrary t0 the
conviction of the mind_
t0 the illumination of the conscience; and even t0 the
verdict of the heart.
The fact that the unpardonable sin involves such extreme hardness of heart
and lack of repentance indicates that those who fear they have committed it;
yet still have SOrTow for sin in their heart and desire to seek after God,
certainly do not fall in the category of those who are guilty of it. Berkhof says
that
we may be reasonably sure that those who fear that they have committed
Jgainst !
working
bring
uusting
from
This
it and worry about this_
and desire the prayers of others for them, have not
committed iL:
This understanding of the unpardonable sin also fits well with Hebrews 6.4-6.
There the persons who
commit apostasy'
have had all sorts of knowledge
and conviction of the truth: they have "been enlightened" and have
'rasted the
heavenly gift" =
have participated in some ways in the work of the Holy
Spirit and "have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the
age t0 come,
yet they then willfully turn away from Christ and ~hold him up
contempt" (Heb: 6.6).
too have put themselves beyond the reach of
God's ordinary means of bringing people to repentance and faith. Knowing
and being convinced of the truth; they willfully reject it.
First John 5.16-17, however; seems t0 fall in another category That passage
does not speak of
sin that can never be
forgiven, but rather about_
sin thac;
if persisted in, will lead t0 death:
sin seems t0 involve the teaching of
serious doctrinal error about Christ. In the context of asking in faith according
to God $ will (1 John 5.14-15) John simply tells us that he does not say that
we can pray in faith for God simply to forgive that sin unless the person
repents
but he certainly does not prohibit praying that the heretical teachers
would tum from their heresy and repent and thereby find forgiveness. Many
people who teach serious doctrinal error have still not gone SO far as [O
commit the unpardonable sin and bring on themselves the impossibility of
repentance and faith by their Own hardness of heart:
The Funchmnent of Sin
Although God'$ punishment of sin does serve as
deterrent against further
sinning and as
warning t0 those who observe
this is not the primary
reason
why God punishes sin. The primary reason is that God $ righteousness
demands
so that he might be glorified in the universe that he has created.
He is the Lord who practices "steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the
earth; for in these things
delight, says the LORD
(Jer: 9.24).
Paul
of Christ Jesus "whom God put fonward as
propitiation by his
blood, through faith" (Rom: 3.25_
author
translation). Paul then explains
why God put fOrward Jesus as
propitiation'
(that is
sacrifice that bears
the wrath of God against sin and thereby turns God $ wrath into favor): "This
was to show God s righteousness
because in his divine forbearance he had
passed over former
sins"
Rom. 3.25). Paul realizes that if Christ had not
come
pay the penalty for sins,
God could not be shown to be righteous_
Because he had passed over sins and not punished them in the past; people
they
They
This
speaks
could rightly accuse God of unrighteousness_
the assumption being that
God
who does not punish sins is not
righteous God. Therefore, when God sent
Christ t0 die and pay the penalty for our sins, he showed how he could still be
righteous
he had stored up the punishment due to previous sins (those of
Old Testament saints_
and then, in perfect righteousness, he gave that penalty
Jesus on the cross. The propitiation of Calvary thereby clearly
demonstrated that God is perfectly righteous: "it was to prove at the present
time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in
Jesus" (Rom. 3.26).
Therefore in the cross we have
clear demonstration of the reason God
punishes sin: if he did not punish sin he would not be
righteous God, and
there would be no ultimate justice in the universe
But when sin is punished,
God is showing himself to be
righteous judge over all, and justice is being
done in his universe.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Has
this chapter increased your awareness of the sin
remaining
your own life? Are YOu able t0 mention any specific ways in which
this was true? Did the chapter increase in You any sense of the
hatefulness of sin? Why do You not feel
more often
deeper sense of the
hatefulness of sin? What do you think the overall effect of this chapter
will be on your personal relationship with God?
Would it ultimately be more
comforting to YOu to think that sin came
into the world because God ordained that it would come through
secondary agents,
because he could not prevent
even though it was
against his will? How would you
about the universe and your place
in it if yOu thought that evil had always existed and there was an ultimate
dualism" in the universe?
Can you name some parallels between the temptation faced by Eve and
temptations that you face even nOw in your Christian life?
Do you feel
sense of unfairness that you are counted
because of
Adam'$ sin (if yOu agree that Rom
5.12-21 teaches this)? How can yOu
deal with this sense
unfaimess t0 keep it
becoming
hindrance
in your relationship with God? At a level of deep conviction, do you
really think
before being
Christian; YOu were totally unable to do
any spiritual good before God? Similarly; are YOu deeply convinced that
this
true of
unbelievers
0r' do YOu think that this is just
doctrine
that may Or' may not be true,
at least one that you do not find deeply
convincing
as you look at the lives of the unbelievers whom you know?
What kind of freedom of choice do the unbelievers whom you know
reading
teel
guilty
from
thal,
actually have? Apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, are YOu convinced
that they will not change their fundamental rebellion against God?
How can the biblical teaching of degrees of seriousness of sin help your
Christian life at this point? Have you known
sense of God's "fatherly
displeasure
when you have sinned? What is your response to that sense?
Do you think that Christians today have lost sight of the hatefulness of
sin [0
large extent? Have unbelievers also lost sight of this? Do You
think that we as Christians have lost sight of the thoroughgoing
pervasiveness of sin in unbelievers, of the truth that the greatest problem
of the human race_
and of all societies and civilizations, is not lack of
education or lack of communication or lack of material
well-being, but
sin against God?

Psalm 51:1-4:
Have mercy on me,
God, according to your steadfast love;
according
[0 your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity;
and cleanse me from my sin!
For
know my transgressions_
and my sin
ever before me.
Against YOu; YOU only; have
sinned,
and done that which is evil in your sight;
that you are justified in your sentence
and blameless in your judgment:
HYMN
God, Be Merciful to
This is an excellent example of the words of
psalm set tO music: The psalm
was
originally
David '$ heartfelt confession of great sin before God_
but
even today it is an excellent pattern of confession that we ourselves might
speak to God:
God_
merciful to me;
on thy grace
rest my plea;
Plenteous in compassion thou_
blot out my transgressions nOw;
Wash me_

Thou alone my Savior art,

Broken, humbled to the dust
by thy wrath and judgment
Let my contrite heart rejoice

From my sins 0 hide thy face;

The Covenants Between God and Man
What principles determine the way God relates t0 us?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
How does God relate t0 man? Since the creation of the world
God's
relationship
man has been defined by specific requirements and promises_
God tells people how he wants them
act and also makes promises about
how he will act toward them in various circumstances_
The Bible contains
several summaries of the provisions that define the different relationships
between God and man that occur in Scripture
and
often calls these
summaries
covenants.
With respect to covenants between God and man in
Scripture_
we may give the following definition:
covenant iS an
unchangeable , divinely imposed legal agreement between God and man that

Although this definition includes the word agreement in order t0 show that
there are tWo parties, God and man, who must enter into the provisions of the
relationship, the phrase "divinely imposed" is also included to show that man

only accept the covenant obligations 0r reject them: Probably for this reason
the Greek translators of the Old Testament (known as the Septuagint), and,
following them, the New Testament authors_
did not use the ordinary Greek
word for contracts or agreements in which both parties were equal (syntheke),

provisions of the covenant were laid down by one of the parties only (In facL;
the word diatheke was often used t0 refer [0

person would leave to assign the distribution of his or her

This definition also notes that covenants are "unchangeable_
They may be

Since the covenant relationship between God and man occurs in various
forms throughout Scripture from Genesis to Revelation;

the image of God) and man as fallen into sin_
but before the discussion of the
person and work of Christ:

Some have questioned whether it is appropriate t0 speak of
covenant of
works thar God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The actual
word covenant is nOr used in the Genesis narratives.
However; the essential
parts of the covenant are all there
clear definition of the parties involved,
legally binding set of provisions that stipulates the conditions of their
relationship, the promise of
for obedience, and the condition for
obtaining those blessings. Moreover; Hosea 6.7, in referring t0 the sins of
Israel, says, "But like Adam they transgressed the covenant
(RSV mg;; s0
NIV; NASB)
This passage views Adam as
covenant
relationship that he then transgressed in the Garden of Eden
In addition, in
Romans 5.12-21 Paul sees both Adam and Christ as heads of
people whom
they represent;
something that would be entirely consistent with the idea of
Adam being in
covenant before the fall
In the Garden of Eden; it seems quite clear that there was
legally binding set
of provisions that defined the conditions of the relationship between God and
man_
The two parties are evident as God
to Adam and gives
commands t0 him. The requirements of the relationship are clearly defined in
the commands that God gave to Adam and Eve (Gen. 1.28-30; cf: 2:15) and
in the direct command to Adam; "You may freely eat of every tree of the
garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat; for
in the day that YOu eat of it YOu shall die" (Gen: 2.16-17).
In this statement t0 Adam about the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil
there is
promise of punishment for disobedience
death; most fully
understood to mean death in an extensive sense, physical, spiritual, and
eternal death and separation from God_
In the promise of punishment for
disobedience there is implicit
promise of blessing for obedience. This
would consist of not
receiving death, and the implication is that the
would be the opposite of
death: '
It would involve physical life that
would not end and spiritual life in terms of
relationship with God that would

Another evidence that the covenant relationship with God in the

18.5 [0 say, about the provisions of the law; "He who does them shall live by
them" (Gal. 3.12; cf: Rom: 10.5).
Other covenants in Scripture generally have an outward "sign" associated
with them (such as circumcision, or baptism and the Lord's Supper)_
No
"sign" for the covenant of works is clearly designated as such in Genesis_
but
if we
were

would probably be the tree of life in the midst of
the garden
By partaking of that tree Adam and Eve would be partaking of the
promise of eternal life that God would give. The fruit itself did not have
magical properties but would be

that the inward reality would occur:
Why is it important tO speak of the relationship between God and man in the

relationship, including the commands of obedience and promise of blessing

something that automatically occurred in the
relationship between Creator and creature_
God did not make any such
covenant with the animals that he created, for example_
Nor did the nature of
man as God created him demand that God have any fellowship with man or
that God make any promises concerning his relationship with men Or give
Mal
any clear directions concerning what he should do. All this was an
expression of God $ tatherly love for the man and woman he had created_
Moreover; when we specify this relationship as
covenant;
it helps us tO
see the clear
parallels between this and the subsequent covenant relationships
that God had with his people. If all the elements of
covenant are present
(clear stipulation of the parties involved, statement of the conditions of the
covenant; and
promise of blessing for obedience and punishment for
disobedience) , then there seems no
eason Why we should not refer [0 it as
covenant; for that is indeed what
was.

Although the covenant that existed before the fall has been referred to by
various terms (such as the Adamic Covenant; Or the Covenant of Nature), the
most helpful designation seems to be

in the blessings of the covenant clearly depended on obedience or

God sovereignly imposes this covenant on Adam and

and they have no opportunity to change the details
their only choice is
keep it or t0 break iL:
Is the covenant of works still in force? In several important senses it is. First
of all, Paul implies that perfect obedience t0 God's laws; if it were possible
would lead t0 life (see Rom: 7:10; 10.5; Gal. 3.12).
We should also notice that
the punishmenc for this covenant is still in effect, for "the wages of sin is
death" (Rom: 6.23). This implies that the covenant of works is still in force
for every human being apart from Christ; even though no sinful human being
can fulfill its provisions and
by it: Finally, we should note that
Christ perfectly obeyed the covenant of works for us since he committed no
sin (1 Peter 2.22) but completely obeyed God on our behalf (Rom 5.18-19).
On the other hand, in certain senses_
the covenant of works does not remain in
force:
We no longer are faced with the specific command not tO eat of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. (2) Since we all have
sinful nature
(both Christians and non-Christians), we are not able t0
the provisions
of the covenant of works 0n Our Own and receive its benefits
as this
covenant applies to people directly; it only
punishments. (3) For
Christians_
Christ has fulfilled the provisions of this covenant successfully
once for all, and
gain the benefits of it not by actual obedience on our part
but by trusting in the merits of Christ'$ work In
for Christians today tO
think of themselves as obligated t0 try to earn God s favor by obedience
would be t0 cut themselves off
the hope of salvation_
who rely on
works of the law are under
curse.
Now ir is evident that no man is
justified before God by the law (Gal. 3.10-11) Christians have been freed
from the covenant of works by virtue of Christ'$ work and their inclusion in
the new covenant; the covenant of grace (see below)

included an
agreement to give tO the Son
people whom he would redeem for his own

man (Col.
2.9; Heb. 10.5), to accept him as representative of his people whom he had
redeemed (Heb. 9.24), and to give him all authority in heaven and on earth
(Matt: 28:18) , including the authority to pour out the Holy Spirit in power to
apply redemption to his people (Acts 1:4; 2.33).
On the part of the Son, there was an agreement that he would come into the
world as
man and
man under the Mosaic law (Gal. 4.4; Heb. 2.14-
18), and that he would be perfectly obedient to all the commands of the Father
(Heb. 10.7-9),
becoming obedient unto death,
even death on
cross (Phil.
2.8). The Son also agreed that he would gather for himself
people in order

by which man could be saved_
The rest of Scripture after the story of the fall
in Genesis 3 is the story of God working out in history the amazing plan of
redemption whereby sinful people could come into fellowship
himself:
Once
God clearly defines the provisions of
covenant that would
specify the relationship between himself and those whom he would redeem
In these specifications we find some variation in detail throughout the Old
and New Testaments, but the essential elements of
covenant are all there;
and the nature of those essential elements remains the same throughout the
Old Testament and the New Testament
The parties to this covenant of grace are God and the people whom he will
redeem: But in this case Christ fulfills
special role as "mediator" (Heb. 8.6;
9.15; 12.24) in which he fulfills the conditions of the covenant for uS and
thereby reconciles us to God_
(There was no mediator between God and man
in the covenant of works )
The condition (or requirement) ot participation in the covenant is faith in the
work of Christ the redeemer (Rom: 1.17; 5.1; et al.) This requirement of faith
in the redemptive work of the Messiah was also the condition of
obtaining the
blessings of the covenant in the Old Testament; as Paul clearly demonstrates
through the examples of Abraham and David (Rom. 4.1-15).
like other
Old Testament believers,

Messiah who was

But while the condition of beginning the covenant of grace is always faith in

the condition of continuing in that covenant is said t0 be

Though this obedience did not

Testament and does not
the New Testament earn us any merit with God
nonetheless, if our faith in Christ is
genuine, it will produce obedience (see
James 2:17), and obedience to Christ is in the New Testament seen as
necessary evidence that we are truly believers and members of the new
covenant (see
John 2.4-6).
The promise of blessings in the covenant was
promise of eternal life with
God: This promise was repeated frequently throughout the Old and the New
Testaments_
God promised that he would be their God and that
would be
his people_

That theme is picked up in the New Testament as well:

and they shall be my people" (2 Cor: 6.16; cf:
similar theme in vv 17-18;
also
Peter 2.9-10). In speaking of the new covenant; the author of Hebrews
quotes Jeremiah 31: "[ will be their God, and
shall be my people'
(Heb
8.10) . This blessing finds fulfillment
the church
which is the people of
God
but it finds its greatest fulfillment in the new heaven and new earth, as
John sees in his vision of the age tO come: "Behold, the
dwelling of God is
with men.
He will dwell with them; and they shall be his people, and God
himself
be with them
(Rev: 21.3).
The sign of this covenant (the outward, physical symbol of inclusion in the
covenant) varies between the Old Testament and the New Testament: In the
Old Testament the outward sign of beginning the covenant relationship was
circumcision. The sign of continuing the covenant relationship was
continuing
observe all the festivals and ceremonial laws that God gave the
people at various times_
In the new covenant, the sign of beginning
covenant
relationship is baptism, while the sign of continuing in that relationship is
participation in the Lord s Supper:
The reason this covenant is called
covenant of grace
is that it is entirely
based on God $
grace
unmerited favor [Oward those whom he redeems.
Various Forms of the Covenant Although the essential elements of the
covenant of grace remain the same throughout the history of God'$ people,
the
provisions of the covenant vary from time
time.
At the time of
Adam and Eve, there was only the bare hint of the possibility of _
relationship
with God found in the promise about the seed of the woman in Genesis 3.15
and in God's gracious provision of clothing for Adam and Eve
Gen. 3.21).
The covenant that God made with Noah after the flood (Gen: 9.8-17) was not

but simply one in which God promised all mankind and
the animal
creation that the

this sense the covenant with Noah, although
certainly does depend on God'$
grace Or unmerited favor; appears to be quite different in the parties involved
(God and all mankind, not just the redeemed), the condition named (no faith
obedience is required of man) , and the blessing that is promised (that the
earth will not be destroyed again by flood, certainly
different promise from
that of eternal life) The sign of the covenant (the rainbow) is also different in

But

that "the scripture
preached the gospele

was the
beginning of God's working to fulfill the ancient covenant promises
Abraham
'[O perform the mercy promised t0 our fathers_
and to remember

So the covenant promises t0 Abraham remained in force even as
found fulfillment in Christ (see Rom 41-25; Gal. 36-18,
29; Heb:
2.16; 6.13-20).
What then
the
old covenant"-
in contrast with the
new covenant" in
Christ? It is not the whole of the Old Testament; because the covenants with
Abraham and David are never called "old" in the New Testament_ Rather;
only the covenant under Moses; the covenant made
Mount Sinai (Ex: 19
24) is called the
old covenant" (2 Cor: 314; cf: Heb_
8.6, 13), to be replaced
by the
new covenant" in Christ (Luke 22.20;
Cor: 11.25;
Cor: 3.6; Heb_
8.8, 13; 9.15; 12.24)_
The Mosaic covenant was an administration
of detailed
written laws given fOr
time t0 restrain the sins of the people and to be
custodian to point people to Christ: Paul says; "Why then the law? It was
added because of transgressions_
till the
offspring should come
whom the
promise had been made" (Gal: 319), and, "The law was OuI custodian until
Christ came
(Gal. 3.24).
We should not assume that there was nO grace available to people from Moses
until Christ; because the promise of salvation by faith that God had made to
Abraham remained in force:
Now the promises were made tO Abraham and to his
offspring_
the
law; which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not
annul
covenant previously ratified by God, S0 as t0 make the
promise void. For if the inheritance is by the law; it is no longer by
promise:
but God gave it tO Abraham by
promise: (Gal. 3.16-18)
Moreover; although the sacrificial system of the Mosaic covenant did not
really take away sins (Heb. 10:1-4), it foreshadowed the bearing of sin by
Christ; the perfect high priest who was also the perfect sacrifice (Heb_
9.11-
28). Nevertheless_
the Mosaic covenant itself;
all its detailed laws, could
not save people:
is not that the laws were WrOng in themselves, for they
were given Dy
holy God_
but -
had no power to give people new life
and
the people were not able to obey them perfectly: "Is the law then against the
promises of God? Certainly not; for if
law had been given which could
they
with
they
make alive_
then righteousness would indeed be by the law
(Gal. 3.21). Paul
realizes that the Holy Spirit working within uS can empower US t0
God
in a way that the Mosaic law never could, for he says that God "has made uS
competent to be ministers of
new covenant; not in
written code but in the
Spirit; for the written code kills
but the Spirit gives life
(2 Cor: 3.6).
The new covenant in Christ; then, is far
because it fulfills the promises
made in Jeremiah 31.31-34,as quoted in Hebrews &:
But as it is, Christ has obtained
ministry which is as much more
excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is
enacted on better promises:
For
that first covenant had been faultless,
there would have been no occasion for
second:
For he finds fault with them when he says:
"The days will come_
says the Lord,
when
will establish
new covenant with the house of
[srael
and with the house of Judah;
not like the covenant that
made with their fathers
on the day when
took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
for they did not continue in my covenant;
and S0
paid no heed t0 them; says the Lord
This is the covenant that
will make with the house of
[srael
after those days, says the Lord:
[will put my laws into their minds_
and write them on their hearts,
and
will be their God,
obey
better
and
shall be my people
And they shall not teach every one his fellow
every one his brother; saying;
Know the Lord,
for all shall know me;
from the least of them to the greatest
For

and
will remember their sins no more:
speaking of a new covenant he treats the first as obsolete. And what
is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready tO vanish away: (Heb_
8.6-13)
In this new covenant; there are far greater blessings, for Jesus the Messiah has
come; he has lived, died, and risen among uS_
once forall for our sins
(Heb_
9.24-28); he has revealed God most fully to us (John 1:14; Heb: 1.1-3);
he has poured out the Holy Spirit on all his people in new covenant power
(Acts 1.8;
Cor: 12.13;
Cor: 3.4-18); he has written his laws on our hearts
(Heb. &.10). This new covenant is the
eternal
covenant" (Heb_
13.20) in
Christ; through which we shall forever have fellowship with God, and he shall
be our God;
and we shall be his people:

Chapter 26
The Person of Christ
How is Jesus fully God and fully man; yet one person?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We may summarize the biblical teaching about the person of Christ as
follows: Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man in one person, and will be
forever:
The scriptural material supporting this definition is extensive:
We will discuss
first the humanity of Christ, then his deity, and then attempt t0 show how
Jesus
deity and humanity are united in the one person of Christ
The Humaniti-
Christ
Birth: When we speak of the humanity of Christ it is appropriate
begin with
consideration of the virgin birth of Christ Scripture clearly
asserts that Jesus was conceived in the womb of his mother Mary by
miraculous work of the Holy Spirit and without
human father:
the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: When his mother Mary
had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be
with child of the Holy Spirit" (Matt: 1.18). Shortly after that an angel of the
Lord said t0 Joseph; who was engaged to Mary; "Joseph, son of David_
do nOr
fear t0 take Mary Your wife
for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Spirit'
(Matt: 1.20). Then we read that Joseph "did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him; he took his wife_
but knew her not until she had bomne
son; and he called his name Jesus
(Matt: 1.24-25).
The same fact is affirmed in Luke
gospel, where we read about the
appearance of the angel
Gabriel to Mary. After the angel had told her that she
would bear
SOn ,
Mary said,
How shall this be
since
have no husband?"
The angel answered,
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
Virgin
~Now
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you=
therefore the child to be born will be called holy;
the Son of God:
(Luke 1.35; cf: 3.23)
The doctrinal importance of the virgin birth is seen in at least three areas:
-It shows that salvation ultimately must come from the Lord. Just as
God
had promised that the
seed" of the woman (Gen. 3.15) would ultimately
destroy the serpent; so God brought
about by his own power; not through
mere human effort: The virgin birth of Christ is an unmistakable reminder that
salvation can never come through human effort; but must be the work of God
himself. Our salvation only comes about through the supernatural work of
God
and that was evident at the
beginning of Jesus
life when
sent
forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law;
redeem those who were
under the law; so that we might receive adoption as sons
(Gal. 44-5).
2. The virgin birth made possible the uniting of full deity and full humanity in
one person_
This was the means God used to send his Son (John 3.16; Gal:
4.4) into the world as
man. If we think for
moment of other
possible ways
in which Christ might have come t0 the earth; none of them
so clearly
unite humanity and deity
one person: It
probably
have been possible
for God t0 create Jesus as
complete human
in heaven and send him [0
descend from heaven
earth without the benefit of any human parent But
then it would have been very hard for US [0 see
how Jesus could be fully
human as we are
nor would he be
pait of the human race that physically
descended from Adam. On the other hand, it probably would have been
possible for God to have Jesus come into the world with two human parents_
both
father and
mother; and with his full divine nature miraculously united
his human nature
some point early in his life: But then it would have
been hard for us to understand how Jesus was fully God, since his origin was
like ours
every way When we think of these two other
possibilities, it helps
uS t0 understand how God, in his wisdom, ordained
combination of human
and divine influence in the birth of Christ,
that his full humanity would be
evident
us from the fact of his ordinary human birth from
human mother;
and his full deity would be evident from the fact of his conception in Mary's
womb by the powerful work of the Holy Spirit:
3. The virgin birth also makes possible Christ'$ true humanity without
inherited sin. As we noted in chapter 24,all human
have inherited
and
corrupt moral nature from their first father; Adam (this is
"God
very
would
would
being
beings
legal
guilt
sometimes called "inherited sin" or "original sin
But the fact that Jesus did
not have
human father means that the line of descent from Adam
partially
interrupted. Jesus did not descend
Adam in exactly the same way in
which every other human being has descended from Adam: And this helps uS
understand why the legal
and moral conuption thar
belongs
other human beings did not belong
Christ:
This idea seems
be indicated in the statement of the angel Gabriel to
where he says t0 her;
"The
Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;
therefore the child to be born will be called holy;
the Son of God:
(Luke 1.35)
Because the Spirit brought about the conception of Jesus in the womb of
the child was t0 be called
Such
conclusion should not be
taken to mean that the transmission of sin comes only through the father; for
Scripture nowhere makes such an assertion. It is enough for us merely t0 say
that in this case the unbroken line of descent from Adam was interrupted, and
Jesus was conceived by the power
the
Spirit: Luke 1.35 connects this
conception by the Holy Spirit with the holiness
moral purity of Christ, and
reflection on that fact allows us to understand that through the absence of a
human father; Jesus was not fully descended from Adam, and that this break
in the line of descent was the method God used to bring
about that Jesus
was fully human yet did not share inherited sin from Adam:
But why did Jesus not inherit
sinful nature from Mary? The Roman Catholic
Church answers this question by saying that Mary herself was free from sin,
but Scripture nowhere teaches this_
and
would not really solve the problem
anyway (for why then did Mary not inherit sin
her mother?)
better
solution is tO say that the work of the Holy Spirit in Mary must have
prevented not only the transmission of sin from Joseph (for Jesus had no
human
father) but also, in
miraculous way; the transmission of sin from
Mary:
The Holy Spirit will come upon yOu
therefore the child to be born
will be called holy
(Luke 1.35).
It has been common_
at least
in previous generations, for those who do not
accept the complete truthfulness of Scripture
deny the doctrine of the virgin
from
guilt _
Mary;
Holy
"holy
Mary,
Holy
from
birth of Christ. But if our beliefs are to be governed by the statements of
Scripture_
then we
certainly not deny this teaching: Whether O1 not we
could discern any aspects of doctrinal importance for this teaching_
we should
believe it first of all simply because Scripture affirms it Certainly such
miracle is not [OO hard for the God who created the universe and everything in
anyone who affirms that _
virgin birth is "impossible
confessing
his or her own unbelief
the God of the Bible. Yet in addition t0 the fact that
Scripture teaches the virgin birth; we can see that it is doctrinally important;
and if we
understand the biblical teaching on the person of Christ
correctly; it is important that we begin with an affirmation of this doctrine_
2. Human Weaknesses and Limitations_
Jesus Had
Human Body: The fact that Jesus had
human body just like
our human bodies is seen in many passages of Scripture. He was bomn just as
all human babies are bom (Luke 2:7). He grew through childhood to
adulthood just as other children grow: "And the child grew and became
strong
filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him'
(Luke 2.40)
Moreover; Luke tells us that
Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in
favor with God and man'
(Luke 2.52).
Jesus became tired just as we do_
for we read that "Jesus_
wearied as he was
with his journey, sat down beside the well" in Samaria (John 4.6). He became
thirsty; for when he was on the cross he said,
thirst" (John 19.28).
After he
had fasted for forty days in the wilderness,
thar "he
was
hungry-
(Matt: 4.2). He was at times physically weak; for
his temptation in the
wilderness he fasted for
(the point at which
human being'$
physical strength is almost entirely gone and beyond which irreparable
physical harm will Occur if the fast continues). At that time "angels came and
ministered t0 him'
(Matt: 411), apparently t0 care for him and provide
nourishment until he regained enough strength to come out of the wilderness.
When Jesus was on his way t0 be crucified, the soldiers forced Simon of
Cyrene
cany his crosS
(Luke 23.26), most likely because Jesus was SO
weak
following the
he had received that he did not have strength
enough
carry it himself: The culmination of Jesus' limitations in terms of
his human body is seen when he died on the cross (Luke 23.46). His human
body ceased
have life in it and ceased
function, just as ours does when
we die
Jesus also rose from the dead in
physical, human body; though one that was
made
perfect and was no longer subject t0 weakness, disease
death. He
demonstrates repeatedly to his disciples that he does have
real physical
Will

beating
body: he says_
See my hands and my feet; that it is
myself; handle me, and
see; for
spirit has not flesh and bones aS YOu see that_
have
(Luke 24.39).
He is showing them and teaching them that he has
flesh and bones
and is
not merely
spirit" without
body. Another evidence of this fact is that
him
piece of broiled fish; and he took it and ate before them"
(Luke 24.42; cf: v 30; John 20.17, 20,27; 21.9, 13).
In this same human body (though
resurrection body that was made perfect),
Jesus also ascended into heaven. He said before he left;
am leaving the
world and going
the Father " (John 16.28; cf. 17:11). The way in which
Jesus ascended up t0 heaven was calculated t0 demonstrate the continuity
between his existence in
physical body here on earth and his continuing
existence
that body in heaven. Just
few verses after Jesus had told them;
"Aspirit has not flesh and bones as YOU see that
have
(Luke 24.39),
read in Luke
gospel that Jesus "led them out as far as Bethany; and
his hands he blessed them: While he blessed them, he parted from them, and
was carried up into heaven
(Luke 24.50-51). Similarly, we read in Acts, "As
they were looking on, he was lifted up, and
cloud took him out of their
sight" (Acts 1.9).
All of these verses taken together show that; as far as Jesus' human body is
concerned, it was like ours in every respect before his resurrection, and after
his resurrection it was still
human body with "flesh and bones,
but made
perfect; the kind of body that we will have when Christ returns and we are
raised from the dead as well.
Jesus continues
exist in that human body in
heaven, as the ascension is designed tO teach:
Jesus Had
Human Mind: The fact that Jesus "increased in wisdom -
(Luke 2.52) says that he went through
learning process just as all other
children do
hhe learned how tO eat; how t0 talk; how t0 read and write, and
how to be obedient to his parents (see Heb. 5.8). This ordinary learning
process was part of the genuine humanity of Christ
We also see that Jesus had
human mind like ours when he speaks of the day
on which he will return t0 earth:
But of that day or that hour nO one knows,
not even the
angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mark
13.32).
Jesus Had
Human Soul and Human Emotions: We see several
indications that Jesus had
human soul (or spirit). Just before his crucifixion,
Jesus said,
Now is my soul troubled" (John 12.27). John writes just
little
"When Jesus had thus spoken; he was troubled in spirit" (John 13.21).
"they
gave
Hifting
later,
In both verses the word troubled represents the Greek term tarasso
word
that is often used of people when they are anxious Or suddenly very surprised
by danger:
Moreover; before Jesus' crucifixion, as he realized the suffering he would
face
he said, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death" (Matt. 26.38) . So
great was the sorrow he felt that it seemed as though; if it were to become any
stronger;
would take his very life:
Jesus had
full range of human emotions_
He "marveled" at the faith of the
centurion (Matt: &.10). He wept with sorrow at the death of Lazanus (John
11.35).
And he prayed with
heart full of emotion, for "in the days of his
flesh; Jesus offered up prayers and supplications
with loud cries and tears_
him who was able t0 save him from death, and he was heard for his
godly
fear"' (Heb. 5.7).
Moreover; the author tells uS,
Although he was
Son, he learned obedience
through what he suffered; and being made perfect he became the source of
eternal salvation t0 all who
him'
(Heb
5.8-9). Yet
Jesus never sinned,
how could he "learn obedience
Apparently as Jesus grew toward maturity
he, like all other human children_
was able t0 take on more and more
responsibility. The older he became the more demands his father and mother
could place on him in terms of obedience, and the more difficult the tasks that
his heavenly Father could assign to him tO cany out in the strength of his
human nature_
With each increasingly difficult task, even when
involved
some
suffering
(as Heb: 5.8 specifies), Jesus' human moral ability, his ability
obey under more and more difficult circumstances
increased
We might
say that his
moral
backbone
was strengthened by more and more difficult
exercise. Yet in all this he never once sinned.
The complete absence of sin in the life of Jesus is all the more remarkable
because of the severe temptations he faced, not only in the wilderness, but
throughout his life_
The author of Hebrews affirms that Jesus "in every respect
has been tempted as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4.15). The fact that he
faced temptation means that he had
genuine human nature that could be
tempted, for Scripture clearly tells us that "God cannot be tempted with evil"
(James 1:13).
d. People Near Jesus Saw Him As Only
Man: Matthew reports an
amazing incident in the middle of Jesus' ministry Even though Jesus had
taught throughout all Galilee, "healing every disease and every infirmity
among the people;
SO that
great crowds followed him" (Matt: 4.23-25),
obey
when he came [0 his own
of Nazareth; the people who had known him
for many years did not receive him:
And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from
there; and
to his Own country he taught them in their
synagogue_
so that they
astonished, and said,
Where did this
man get this wisdom and these mighty works? [s not this the
carpenter
son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his
brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his
sisters with Us? Where then did this man get all this?" And they took
offense at him:
And he did not do many mighty works there,
because of their unbelief (Matt: 13.53
58)
This passage indicates that those people who knew Jesus best, the neighbors
with whom he had lived and worked for thirty years, Saw him as nO more than
ordinary man
good man, no doubt; fair and kind and truthful, but
certainly nor
prophet of God who could work miracles and certainly not
God himself in the flesh Although in the
following sections we will see how
Jesus was fully divine in every way
Was
truly God and man in one person
must
recognize the full force of
passage like this. For the first thirty
years of his life Jesus lived
human life that was
ordinary that the people
of Nazareth who knew him best were amazed that he could teach with
authority and work miracles. They knew him. He was one of them: He was
carpenter'$ son'
(Matt: 13.55), and he was himself "the carpenter" (Mark
6.3), so ordinary that they could ask,
Where then did this man get all this?"
(Matt: 13.56).
And John tells uS
"Even his brothers did not believe in him
(John 7.5).
Was Jesus fully human? He was s0 fully human that even those who lived and
worked with him for thirty years, even those brothers who grew Up in his own
household, did not realize that he was anything more than another very good
human being-
They apparently had no idea that he was God come in the flesh_
3. Sinlessness. Though the New Testament clearly affirms that Jesus was
fully human just aS We are, it also affirms that Jesus was different in one
important respect: he was without sin, and he never committed sin during his
lifetime_
Some have objected that if Jesus did not sin; then he was not truly
human
for all humans sin. But those making that objection simply fail to
realize that human beings are nOw in an abnormal situation. God did not
create US sinful; but holy and righteous:
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
before
sinned were truly human, and we nOw;
though human
do not
match the pattern that God intends for uS when our full, sinless humanity is
village
coming.
Were
still
"the
they
restored:
The sinlessness of Jesus is taught frequently in the New Testament: We see
suggestions of this early in his life when he was "filled with wisdom
and
"the favor of God was upon him" (Luke 2.40). Then we see that Satan was
unable to tempt Jesus successfully; but failed, after forty days, to persuade
him tO sin: "And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed
from him until an opportune time
(Luke 4.13). We also see in the synoptic
gospels (Matthew; Mark; and Luke) no evidence of wrongdoing on Jesus
part To the Jews who opposed him, Jesus asked, "Which of you convicts me
of sin?" (John 8.46), and received no answer:
The statements about Jesus
sinlessness are more explicit in John's gospel
Jesus made the amazing proclamation,
am the light of the world" (John
8.12). If we understand light to represent both truthfulness and moral purity;
then Jesus is here
claiming to be the source of truth and the source of moral
purity and holiness in the world
astounding claim; and one that could
only be made by someone who was free from sin. Moreover; with_
regard to
obedience t0 his Father in heaven; he said_
"Talways do what is pleasing to
him"
(John 8.29; the present tense gives the sense of continual activity;
am
always doing what is pleasing
him'
At the end ot his life_
Jesus could say,
have
my Father'$ commandments and abide in his love
(John 15.10).
It is significant that when Jesus was put on trial before Pilate, in spite of the
accusations of the Jews, Pilate could only conclude;
find no crime in him'
(John 18.38).
In the book of Acts Jesus is several times called the "Holy One
or the
"Righteous One,
0r is referred t0 with some similar expression (see Acts
2.27; 3.14; 4.30.
7.52; 13.35). When Paul
of Jesus coming t0 live as
man he is careful not t0 say that he took on "sinful flesh;
but rather says that
God sent his own Son "in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
(Rom_
8.3).
And he refers
Jesus as
who knew no sin" (2 Cor: 5.21)
The author of Hebrews affirms that Jesus was tempted but simultaneously
insists that he did not sin: Jesus is
one who in every respect has been tempted
as we are, Yet without sin "
(Heb. 4.15). He is
high priest who is "holy;
blameless
unstained, separated from sinners _
exalted above the heavens"
(Heb. 7.26). Peter speaks of Jesus as "a lamb without blemish or
Peter 1:19), using Old Testament imagery t0 affirm his freedom from any
moral defilement: Peter directly states_
"He committed no sin; nO
was
found on his lips" (1 Peter 2.22).
When Jesus died, it was "the righteous for
the unrighteous_
that he might bring 4S to God" (1 Peter 3.18).
And John;
kept
speaks
~sin"
Fhim
spot'
guile -
his first epistle_
calls him "Jesus Christ the righteous'
(1 John 2.1) and says_
"In him there is no sin
(L John 3.5). It is hard to deny; then; that the
sinlessness of Christ is taught clearly in all the major sections of the New
Testament: He was truly man yet without sin:
In connection with Jesus' sinlessness_
should notice in more detail the
nature of his temptations in the wilderness (Matt 41-11; Mark 1.12-13;
Luke 4.1-13). The essence of these temptations was an attempt tO persuade
Jesus
escape from the hard path of obedience and
suffering that was
appointed for him as the Messiah: Jesus was
led by the Spirit for forty days
in the wilderness, tempted by the devil" (Luke 41-2). In many respects this
temptation
4as
parallel to the
thar Adam and Eve faced in the Garden
of Eden, but it was much more difficult: Adam and Eve had fellowship with
God and with each other and had an abundance of all kinds of food_
tor they
were only told not to eat from one tree: By contrast, Jesus had no human
fellowship and no food t0 eat; and after he had fasted for forty days he was
near the point of physical death_
In both cases the kind of obedience required
was not obedience to an eteral moral principle rooted in the character of
God
but was
test of pure obedience to God'$ specific directive:
With Adam
and Eve; God told them nOt to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, and the question was whether they would obey simply because God told
them_
In the case of Jesus; "led by the Spirit" for
in the wilderness
he apparently realized that
was the Father'=
will that he eat nothing during
those days but simply remain there until the Father; through the leading of the
Holy Spirit; told him that the temptations were over and he could leave:
We can understand
then, the force of the temptation; "If you are the Son of
God
command this stone t0 become bread" (Luke 4.3). Of course Jesus was
the Son of God, and of course he had the power t0 make any stone into bread
instantly: He was the one who would soon change water into wine and
multiply the loaves and the fishes. The temptation was intensified by the fact
that
seemed as though, if he did not eat soon, his
life would be taken
from him.
Yet he had come t0
God perfectly in our place, and to do s0
man: This meant that he had to obey in his human strength alone: If he
had called upon his divine powers
make the tempration easier for himself;
then he would not have obeyed God fully as
man. The temptation was to
use his divine power t0
cheat"
bit on the requirements and make obedience
somewhat easier: But Jesus, unlike Adam and Eve, refused tO eat what
appeared to be good and necessary for him; choosing rather to obey the
command of his heavenly Father:
The temptation t0 bow down and worship Satan for
moment and then
testing
forty
days
very
obey
receive
authority over
all the kingdoms of the world" (Luke 4.5) was
temptation t0 receive power not through the path of lifelong obedience to his
heavenly Father; but through wrongful submission t0 the Prince of Darkness.
Again, Jesus rejected the apparently easy
and chose the
obedience that led t0 the crOSS.
Similarly, the temptation tO throw himself down from the pinnacle of the
temple (Luke 4.9-11) was
temptation to "force
God to perform
miracle
and rescue him in
spectacular way; thus attracting
large following from the
people without pursuing the hard path ahead, the path that included three
years of
ministering
people's needs,
teaching with authority, and
exemplifying absolute holiness of life in the midst of harsh opposition: But
Jesus
resisted this
'easy route'
to the fulfillment of his goals as the
Messiah (again,
route that
not actually have fulfilled those goals in
any case).
These temptations
#ere
really the culmination of
lifelong process of moral
strengthening and maturing that occurred throughout Jesus' childhood and
early adulthood, as he "increased in wisdom
and in favor with God" (Luke
2.52) and as he
learned obedience through what he suffered" (Heb: 5.8). In
these temptations
the wilderness and in the various temptations that faced
him through the thirty-three years of his life, Christ obeyed God in our place
and as our representative, thus
succeeding where Adam had failed; where the
people of Israel in the wilderness had failed, and where we had failed (see
Rom. 5.18-19).
As difficult as it may be for uS to
comprehend, Scripture affirms that in these
temptations Jesus gained an ability t0 understand and help us in our
temptations_
Because he himself has suffered and been empted, he is able t0
help those who are tempted" (Heb. 2:18). The author goes on t0 connect
Jesus
ability
sympathize with Our weaknesses t0 the fact the he was
tempted as we are:
For we have not
high priest who
unable (0
sympathize with OuI
weaknesses
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are_
without sin. Let S then [lit
'therefore"
with confidence draw
near t0 the throne of grace; that we may receive mercy and find grace
t0 help in time of need. (Heb. 415-16)
This has practical application for Us: in every situation in which we are
struggling with temptation
we should reflect on the life of Christ and ask if
there were not similar situations that he faced. Usually; after reflecting for

temptation be real
if the person being tempted
nOr able
sin anyway?
order
answer this question we must distinguish what Scripture clearly
affirms, on the one hand
and, on the other hand, what is more in the nature of
possible inference on our part: (1) Scripture clearly affirms that Christ never
actually sinned (see above) There should be no question in our minds at all
on this fact. (2) It also clearly affirms that Jesus was tempted, and that these
were real
temptations (Luke 4.2). If we believe Scripture, then we must insist
that Christ "in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin'
(Heb. 4.15). If our speculation on the question of whether Christ could have
sinned ever leads US tO say that he was not truly tempted, then we have
reached
wrong conclusion, one that contradicts the clear statements of
Scripture _
We also must affirm with Scripture that "God cannot be tempted with
evil" (James 1.13).
But here the question becomes difficult:
Jesus was fully
God as well as fully man (and we shall argue below that Scripture clearly and
repeatedly teaches this), then must we not also affirm that (in some sense)
Jesus also
could not be
tempted with evil"?
This is as far as we can go in terms of clear and explicit affirmations of
Scripture _
At this point we are faced with
dilemma similar t0
number of
other doctrinal dilemmas where Scripture seems t0 be
teaching
that are;
if not directly contradictory; at least very difficult to combine together in Our
understanding:
For example, with respect to the doctrine of the Trinity;
affirmed that God exists in three persons; and each
fully God_
and there is
one God. Although those statements are not contradictory;
are_
nonetheless, difficult tO understand in connection with each other; and
although we can make some progress in understanding how they fit together;
in this life
al least
have t0 admit that there can be no final
understanding
on ouI' part: Here the situation is somewhat similar: We do not have an actual
contradiction. Scripture does not tell us that
Jesus was tempted" and that
day:
things
they
Jesus was not
tempted" (a contradiction if
Jesus
and "tempted" are used
exactly in the same sense in both sentences). The Bible tells us that "Jesus
was
tempted" and "Jesus was fully man" and "Jesus was fully God" and "God
cannot be tempted
This combination of teachings from Scripture leaves
open the possibility that as we understand the way in which Jesus
human
nature and divine nature work together; we might understand more of the way
in which he could be tempted in one sense and yet, in another sense, not be
tempted (This possibility will be discussed further below: )
At this point; then; we pass beyond the clear affirmations of Scripture and
attempt t0 suggest
solution t0 the
problem of whether Christ could have
sinned. But
important to recognize that the following solution
more in
the nature of
suggested means of combining various biblical teachings and
is not directly supported by explicit statements of Scripture_
With this in
mind, it is appropriate for US
say:" (1) If Jesus
human nature had existed by
itself, independent of his divine nature, then
would have been
human
nature just like that which God gave Adam and Eve. It would have been free
from sin but nonetheless able to sin. Therefore_
if Jesus
human nature had
existed by itself, there
the abstract or theoretical
possibility that Jesus
could have sinned, just as Adam and Eve's human natures were able to sin:
But Jesus
human nature never existed apart from union with his divine
nature.
From the moment of his conception, he existed as truly God and truly
man as well. Both his human nature and his divine nature existed united in
one person_
(3) Although there were some
being hungry or
thirsty or weak) that Jesus experienced in his human nature alone and were
not experienced
his divine nature (see below), nonetheless_
an act of sin
would have been
moral
act that would apparently have involved the whole
person of Christ: Therefore
if he had sinned, it would have involved both his
human and divine natures_
But if Jesus as
person had sinned, involving
both his human and divine natures in sin, then God himself would have
sinned, and he would have ceased to be God. Yet that is clearly impossible
because of the infinite holiness of God' $ nature (5) Therefore; if we are
asking if it was actually possible for Jesus
have sinned
seems that we
must conclude that
was not possible.
The union of his human and divine
natures in one person prevented it.
But the question remains,
"How then could Jesus
temptations be
The
example of the temptation
change the stones into bread is helpful in this
regard_
Jesus had the ability; by virtue of his divine nature,
perform this
miracle, but if he had done it; he would no
longer have been obeying in the
strength of his human nature alone, he would have failed the test that Adam
also failed, and he would nor have earned our salvation for uS_
Therefore
things
(such
real?""
Jesus refused tO rely on his divine nature t0 make obedience easier for him
like manner; it seems appropriate to conclude that Jesus met every temptation
sin, not by his divine power; but on the strength of his human nature alone
(though; of course; it was nOt
alone'
because Jesus_
exercising the kind of
faith that humans should exercise
was perfectly depending on God the Father
and the Holy Spirit at every moment). The moral strength of his divine nature
was there as
sort of "backstop" that would have prevented him from
in any case (and therefore we can say that
was nOL
possible for him t0 sin),
but he did not rely on the strength of his divine nature
make it easier for
him t0 face temptations, and his refusal t0 turn the stones into bread at the
beginning of his ministry is
clear indication of this_
Were the temptations real then? Many theologians have pointed out that only
he who successfully resists
temptation t0 the end most fully feels the force
of that temptation. Just as
champion weightlifter who successfully lifts and
holds ovel
head the heaviest weight in the contest feels the force of it more
fully than one who attempts t0 lift
and drops iL;
So any Christian who has
successfully faced
temptation to the end knows that that is far more difficult
than giving in to it at once: So
was with Jesus: every temptation he faced,
he faced to the end
and triumphed over it The temptations were real, even
though he did not give in t0 them:
In fact; they were mOSt real
because he did
not give in [0 them:
What then do we say about the fact that "God cannot be tempted with evil"
(James 1.13)? It seems that this is one of
number of
thar we muSt
affirm [0 be true of Jesus' divine nature but nOt of his human nature
His
divine nature could not be tempted with evil, but his human nature could be
tempted and was clearly tempted: How these [WO natures united
one person
temptations, Scripture does not clearly explain to us. But this
distinction between what is tnue of one nature and what is true of another
nature is an example of _
number of similar statements that Scripture requires
uS t0 make (see more on this distinction; below; when we discuss how Jesus
could be God and man in one person).
Was Jesus' Full Humanity Necessary? When John wrote his first
heretical
was
circulating
in the church t0 the effect that
Jesus was nOr
man. This heresy became known as docetism
So serious
was this denial of truth about Christ; that John could say
was
doctrine of
the antichrist: "By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which
confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
of God
and every spirit
which does not confess Jesus
not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist"
John 4.2-3). The apostle John understood that t0 deny Jesus`
true humanity
sinning
things =
facing
Why
epistle,
teaching
was [0
something at the very heart of Christianity; SO that no one who
denied that Jesus had come in the flesh was sent from God_
As we look through the New Testament; we see several reasons why Jesus
had to be fully man if he was going to be the Messiah and earn our salvation
We can list seven of those reasons here_
For Representative Obedience: As we noted in the chapter on the
covenants between God and man above_
Jesus was our representative and
obeyed for us where Adam had failed and disobeyed. We see this in the
parallels between Jesus' tempration (Luke 41-13) and the time of
Adam and Eve in the garden (Gen 2.15-3.7). It is also clearly reflected in
Paul's discussion of the parallels between Adam and Christ; in Adam'$
disobedience and Christ' $ obedience:
Then as one man $ trespass led t0 condemnation for all men, S0 one
man
act of righteousness leads t0 acquittal and life for all men. For
by one man's disobedience many were made sinners
s0 by one
man
obedience many will be made righteous: (Rom: 5.18-19)
why Paul can call Christ "the last Adam"
(1 Cor: 15.45) and can call
Adam the "first man'
and Christ the
second man" (1 Cor: 15.47). Jesus had
man in order [0 be OuI representative and obey in our place_
To Be
Substitute Sacrifice: If Jesus had not been
man, he could not
have died in our place and paid the penalty that was due tO uS.
The author of
Hebrews tells us that
For surely it is not with angels that he
concerned but
with the descendants of Abraham Therefore he had t0 be made like his
brethren in every respect;
that he might become
merciful and faithful
high priest in the service of God, to make expiation [more accurately;
'propitiation"
for the sins of the
(Heb: 2.16-17; cf: v 14). Jesus had
[0 become
man, not an angel, because God was concered with saving men;
not with saving angels_
But t0 d0 this he "had t0
be made like us in every
way; s0 that he might become "the propitiation'
for uS_
the sacrifice that is an
acceptable substitute for us. Though this idea will be discussed more fully
chapter 27_
on the atonement; it is important here t0 realize that unless Christ
was fully man, he could not have died to pay the penalty for man'$ sins. He
could not have been
substitute sacrifice for uS.
To Be the One Mediator Between God and Men: Because we were
alienated from God by sin, we needed someone tO come between God and
ourselves and bring us back to him: We needed
mediator who could
deny
testing -
This
people" ,
represent uS to God and who could represent God tO us
There is only one
person who has ever fulfilled that requirement:
There is one God, and there
is one mediator between God and men
the man Christ Jesus
(1 Tim. 2.5). In
order t0 fulfill this role of mediator; Jesus had to be fully man as well as fully
God
d. To Fulfill God's Original Purpose for Man to Rule Over Creation: As
we saw in the discussion of the purpose for which God created man,
God
mankind on the earth to subdue it and rule over it as God'$
representatives
But man did not fulfill that purpose, for he instead fell into
The author of Hebrews realizes that God intended
everything to be in
subjection t0 man, but he admits; "As it is, we do not
see everything in
subjection t0
him" (Heb_
2.8). Then when Jesus came as
am;
he was able
God and thereby have the right to rule over creation as
man, thus
fulfilling God*s original purpose in putting man On the earth: Hebrews
recognizes this when it says that now
we see Jesus
in the place of authority
over the universe,
crowned with glory and honor" (Heb.
2.9; cf: the same
phrase in -
7). Jesus in fact has been given "all authority in heaven and on
(Matt. 28.18) , and God has "put all things under his feet and has made
him the head over all things for the church" (Eph: 1.22)
Indeed
shall
someday reign with him on his throne (Rev 3.21) and experience
subjection to Christ our Lord, the fulfillment of God'$ purpose that we reign
over the earth (cf: Luke 19.17, 19;
Cor: 6.3). Jesus had to be
man in Order
fulfill God's original purpose that man rule over his creation.
To Be Our Example and Pattern in Life: John tells US, "He who says he
abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked" (1 John
2.6), and reminds us that
when he appears we shall be like him;
and that
this hope of future conformity t0 Christ'$ character even nOW gives
increasing
moral purity tO our lives
John 3.2-3). Paul tells us that
continually
being
changed into his likeness
Cor: 3.18) , thus moving toward the
for which God saved uS
that we might "be conformed tO the image of his
Son" (Rom. 8.29). Peter tells us that especially in suffering we have to
consider Christ'$ example: "Christ also suffered for YOu, leaving YOu an
example; that you should follow in his steps
Peter 2.21) Throughout Our
Christian life,
we are [0 run the race set before uS
"looking
t0 Jesus the
pioneer and perfecter of our faith" (Heb: 12.2). If we become discouraged by
the hostility and opposition of sinners
are t0
consider him who endured
from sinners such hostility against himself" (Heb. 12.3). Jesus is also our
example in death_
Paul'
goal is to become "like him in his death" (Phil 3.10;
Acts 7:60=
Peter 3.17-18 with 4:1). Our

with strong trust in him, and with love and
forgiveness
others. Jesus
had t0 become
man like US in order t0 live as
example and pattern in
life.
f: To Be the Pattern for Our Redeemed Bodies: Paul tells uS thar when
Jesus rose from the dead he rose in
new body that was "imperishable
raised in glory
raised in power
raised
spiritua_
body"
Cor: 15.42 _
44). This new resurrection body that Jesus had when he rose from the dead is
the pattern for what our bodies will be like when we are raised from the dead,
because Christ is "the tirst fruits'
(1 Cor: 15.23)
an agricultural metaphor
that likens Christ t0 the first sample of the harvest;
what the other
fruuit from that hairvest would be like_
We nOw have
physical body like
Adam $
but we will have one like Christ's:
Just as
have borne the
of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven"
Cor:
15.49). Jesus had to be raised as
man in order t0 be the "first-bom from the
dead" (Col: 1:18) , the pattern for the bodies that we would later have_
g. To Sympathize As High Priest: The author of Hebrews reminds us that
"because he himself has suffered and been tempted_
he is able t0 help those
who are tempted" (Heb: 2.18; cf: 415-16). If Jesus had not been
man, he
would not have been able to know by experience what we go through in our
temptations and struggles in this life. But because he has lived as
man, he is
able
sympathize more fully with us in our experiences_
6. Jesus Will Be
Man Forever: Jesus did not give up his human nature after
his death and resurrection, for he appeared to his disciples as
man after the
resurrection_
even with the scars of the nail prints in his hands (John 20.25_
27). He had "flesh and bones"
(Luke 24.39) and ate food (Luke 24.41-42).
Later; when he was
with his disciples_
he was taken up into heaven_
still in his resurrected human body, and two angels promised that he would
return in the same way:
This Jesus_
Who was taken up fom YOu into heaven_
will come in the same way aS YOu saw him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). Still
later; Stephen gazed into heaven and saw Jesus as "the Son of man
standing =
the right hand of God" (Acts 7.56). Jesus also appeared to Saul on the
Damascus Road and said, "Iam Jesus,;
whom yOu are
ecuting
(Acts 9.5)
an appearance that Saul (Paul) later coupled with the resurrection
appearances of Jesus
others (1 Cor: 9.1; 15.8).
John'$ vision in
Revelation, Jesus still appears as
one
son of man'
(Rev: 1:13), though
he is filled with great glory and power; and his appearance causes John to fall
at his feet in awe (Rev: 1.13-17). He promises one
to drink wine again
with his disciples in his Father's kingdom (Matt. 26.29) and invites uS [0
great marriage supper
heaven (Rev: 19.9). Moreover; Jesus will continue
our
showing
image
talking -
perse
Ike
day
forever in his offices as prophet; priest, and
all of them carried out by
virtue of the fact that he is both God and man forever:
All of these texts indicate that Jesus did not temporarily become man
but that
his divine nature was permanently united t0 his human nature_
and he lives
forever not just as the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity,
but also as Jesus
the man who was born of
and as Christ; the Messiah
and Savior of his people. Jesus will remain fully God and fully man;
one
person, forever:
The Deity of Chris
To complete the biblical
teaching about Jesus Christ; we mus
affirm not only
that he was fully human, but also that he was fully divine. Although the word
does not explicitly occur in Scripture
the church has used the term
incarnation t0 refer [0 the fact that Jesus was God in human flesh: The
incarnation was the act of God the Son whereby he took to himself
human
nature.
The scriptural proof for the deity of Christ is
extensive in the
New Testament. We shall examine
under several categories_
1. Direct Scriptural Claims_
In this section
examine direct statements of
Scripture that Jesus is God or that he
divine_
The Word God (Theos) Used of Christ: Although the word theos
God_
is usually reserved in the New Testament for God the Father; nonetheless_
there are severa
passages where it is also used
refer t0 Jesus Christ: In all
of these passages the word "God" is used in the strong sense
refer [0 the
one who is the Creator of heaven and earth, the ruler over all
These passages
include John 1:1; 1.18 (in older and better manuscripts); 20.28; Romans 9.5;
Titus 2:13; Hebrews 1:8 (quoting Ps. 45.6); and
Peter 1:1_
As these
passages have been discussed in some detail in the chapter on the Trinity;
the discussion will not be repeated here_
It is enough to note that there are at
least these seven clear passages in the New Testament that explicitly refer t0
Jesus as God:
One Old Testament example of the name God applied to Christ is seen in a
familiar messianic passage:
For t0 uS
child is born
[O US
son is given; and
the government will be upon his shoulder; and his name will be called
Wonderful Counselor; Mighty God
(Isa. 9.6).
king:
Mary;
ye[ =
vely
The Word Lord (Kyrios) Used of Christ: Sometimes the word Lord (Gk
kyrios) is used simply as
polite address t0
superior;
equivalent to
ouI word sir (see Matt: 13.27; 21.30; 27.63; John 4.11). Sometimes it can
simply mean
master" of _
servant or slave (Matt: 6.24; 21.40). Yet the same
word is also used
the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old
Testament; which was commonly used at the time of Christ) as
translation
for the Hebrew yhwh; " Yahweh,
or" (as it is frequently translated) "the
LORD,
Jehovah:
The word kyrios is used tO translate the name of the
Lord 6,814 times in the Greek Old Testament Therefore, any Greek-speaking
reader at the time of the New Testament who had any knowledge at all of the
Greek Old Testament would have recognized that; in contexts where it was
appropriate, the word "Lord" was the name of the one who was the Creator
and Sustainer of heaven and earth, the omnipotent God
Now there are many instances in the New Testament where
Lord" is used of
Christ
what can only be understood as this strong Old Testament sense;
Lord" who is Yahweh or God himself: This use of the word
Lord" is
quite striking in the word of the angel to the shepherds of Bethlehem: "For t0
You is bom this
in the city of David
Savior; who
Christ the Lord"
(Luke 2:11). Though these words are familiar to us from frequent reading of
the Christmas
we should realize how surprising it would be t0 any first-
century Jew to hear that someone born as
was the "Christ" (0r
"Messiah"
and_
moreover; that this one who was the Messiah was also "the
Lord"_
that is, the Lord God himself! The amazing force of the
angel 's
statement; which the shepherds could hardly believe
was [O say; essentially;
Today
Bethlehem
baby has been born who is your Savior and your
Messiah
and who is also God himself:
It is not surprising that "all who
heard
wondered at what the shepherds told them
(Luke 2.18).
When Mary comes t0 visit Elizabeth several months before Jesus is t0 be
born, Elizabeth says, "Why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord
should come t0 me?" (Luke 1:43)
Because Jesus was not even bom;
Elizabeth could not be using the word
Lord" t0 mean
something like human
master:
She must rather be using it in the strong Old Testament sense,
giving an amazing sense tO the sentence:
Why is this granted me, that the
mother of the Lord God himself should come to me?" Though this is
very
strong statement, it is difficult tO understand the word "Lord" in this context
in any weaker sense.
We see another example when Matthew says that John the Baptist is the one
who cries out in the wilderness
"Prepare the way of the Lord
make his paths
straight" (Matt: 3.3). In doing this John is quoting
Isaiah 40.3, which speaks
roughly
"the
day
story;
baby
about the Lord God himself coming among his people.
But the context applies
this passage to John'$ role of preparing the way for Jesus t0 come:
implication is that when Jesus comes
the Lord himself will come_
Jesus also identifies himself as the sovereign Lord of the Old Testament when
he asks the Pharisees about Psalm 110:, "The Lord said t0 my Lord, Sit at my
right hand, till
your enemies under your feet" (Matt: 22.44). The force of
this statement is that "God the Father said to God the Son [David's Lord];
Sit
at my right hand_
The Pharisees know he is talking about himself and
identifying himself as one worthy of the Old Testament title kyrios,
Lord_
Such usage is seen frequently in the Epistles, where "the Lord" is
common
name t0 refer t0 Christ: Paul says "there is one God, the Father; from whom
are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom are all
and through whom we exist"
Cor: 86; cf: 12.3
and
many other passages in the Pauline epistles)
particularly clear passage is found in Hebrews
where the author quotes
Psalm 102
which
about the work of the Lord in creation and applies it
[0 Christ:
You_
Lord, founded the earth in the beginning
and the heavens are the work of your hands;
will perish; but YOu remain;
will all grow old like
garment;
mantle you will roll them up
and they will be changed.
But you are the same,
and your years will never end. (Heb. 1.10-12)
Here Christ is explicitly spoken of as the eternal Lord of heaven and earth
who created all
and will remain the same forever Such strong usage of
the term "Lord" to refer [0 Christ culminates in Revelation 19.16
where we
see Christ returning as conquering King; and "On his robe and on his thigh he
has
name inscribed_
of kings and Lord of lords

Other Strong Claims to Deity: In addition to the uses of the word God
and Lord to refer t0 Christ; we have other passages that strongly claim deity
for Christ. When Jesus told his Jewish opponents that Abraham had seen his
(Christ's)
they challenged him;
You are not yet fifty years old, and have
you seen Abraham?" (John 8.57). Here
sufficient response t0 prove Jesus
etemity would have been;
Before Abraham was_
was _
But Jesus did nOr
say this. Instead
he made
much more
assertion:
Truly, truly;
say
[0 you_
before Abraham was,
am
(John 8.58). Jesus combined two
assertions whose sequence seemed to make no sense: "Before something in
the past happened [Abraham was], something in the present happened
am]:
The Jewish leaders
recognized at once that he was not speaking in
riddles or uttering nonsense:
when he said,
am,
he was
repeating the very
words God used when he identified himself to Moses as "[AM who IAM"
(Ex. 3.14)-
Jesus was
claiming for himself the title "IAM;-
by which God
designates himself as the eternal
the God who is the source of
his Own existence and who always has been and always will be:
When the
Jews heard this unusual, emphatic; solemn statement; they knew that he was
claiming
[0 be God_
"So they took up stones t0 throw
but Jesus hid
himself, and went out of the temple
(John 8.59).
Another strong claim t0 deity is Jesus
statement at the end of Revelation,
am the Alpha and the Omega_
the first and the
the beginning and the end"
(Rev: 22.13). When this is combined with the statement of God the Father in
Revelation 1.8
TTam the Alpha and the Omega_
it also constitutes
strong
claim to equal deity with God the Father: Sovereign over all of history and all
of creation, Jesus
the beginning and the end_
In John 1:1.
John not only calls Jesus "God" but also refers t0 him as "the
Word" (Gk: logos) John' $ readers would have recognized in this term logos
dual reference; both t0 the powerful, creative Word of God in the Old
Testament by which the heavens and earth were created (Ps. 33.6) and
the
organizing
principle of the universe, the thing that held it together
and allowed it tO make sense; in Greek
thinking_
John is identifying Jesus
with both of these ideas and saying that he is not only the powerful, creative
Word of God and the organizing Or
unifying force in the universe; but also
that he became man: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among US, full of
grace and truth; we have beheld his glory; glory as of the only Son from the
Father" (John 1:14). Here
another strong claim to deity coupled with an
explicit statement that Jesus also became man and moved among uS as
man.
Further evidence of claims t0 deity can be found in the fact that Jesus calls
day,
startling
existing
One;
himn;
Jast;
unifying
himself "the Son of man.-
This title is used eighty-four times in the four
gospels but only by Jesus and only to speak of himself (note_
e.g,, Matt: 16.13
with Luke 9.18). In the rest of the New Testament; the phrase "the Son of
man" (with the definite article "the
used only once, in Acts 7.56_
where
Stephen refers t0 Christ as the Son of Man
unique term has as itS
background the vision in Daniel
where Daniel saw one like
"Son of Man'
who
came t0 the Ancient of Days" and was given
dominion and glory and
kingdom, that all peoples, nations
and languages should serve him; his
dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away" (Dan. 7:13-
14). It is striking that this
son of man'
came "with the clouds of heaven"
(Dan. 7:13) This passage clearly speaks of someone who had heavenly origin
and who was given eternal rule over the whole world
The high priests did not
miss the point of this passage when Jesus said_
Hereafter YOu will see the
Son of man seated at the right hand of Power; and coming on the clouds of
heaven
(Matt_ 26.64). The reference
Daniel 7.13-14 was unmistakable,
and the high priest and his council knew that Jesus was claiming to be the
eternal world ruler of heavenly origin spoken of in Daniel'$ vision.
Immediately
said, "He has uttered blasphemy:
He deserves death"
(Matt: 26.65-66) . Here Jesus finally made explicit the strong claims to eternal
world rule that were earlier hinted at in his frequent use of the title "the Son
of man" t0 apply to himself:
'Though the title
Son of God" can sometimes be used simply t0 refer to Israel
(Matt: 2.15), 0r [0 man as created by God (Luke 2.38), or to redeemed man
generally (Rom. 8.14,19, 23) , there are nevertheless instances in which the
phrase "Son of God" refers to Jesus as the heavenly; eternal Son who is equal
God himself (see Matt: 11.25-30; 17.5
Cor: 15.28; Heb: 1.1-3,5, 8).
is especially true in John's gospel where Jesus is seen as
unique Son
from the Father (John 1.14, 18,34,
49) who fully reveals the Father (John
8.19; 14.9).
As Son he is SO great that We

life
(something that could be said of no created being: John 3.16, 36; 20.31). He
is also the one who has all authority from the Father t0 give life, pronounce
eteral judgment; and rle over all (John 3.36; 5.20-22, 25; 10.17; 16.15). As
Son he has been sent by the Father; and therefore he existed before he came
into the world (John 3.37; 5.23; 10.36).
The first three verses of Hebrews are emphatic in
that the Son is the
one whom God
appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he
created the world" (Heb. 1.2). This Son, says the writer; "reflects the glory of
God and bears the very stamp [lit , is the

These passages combine to indicate that the title "Son of God" when applied
to Christ strongly affirms his deity as the eternal Son in the Trinity; one equal
God the Father in all his attributes:
2. Evidence That Jesus Possessed Attributes of Deity: In addition to the
specific affirmations of Jesus' deity seen in the many passages quoted above,
we see many examples of actions in Jesus' lifetime that point to his divine
character:
Jesus demonstrated his omnipotence when he stilled the storm at sea with _
word (Matt 8.26-27), multiplied the loaves and fish (Matt. 14.19), and
changed water into wine (John 2.1-11). Some might object that these miracles
just showed the power of the
Spirit
through him; just as the
Holy Spirit could work through any other human
and therefore these
do not demonstrale Jesus
own deity. But the contextual
explanations
these
events often point not t0 what
demonstrate about the power of the Holy
Spirit but to what
demonstrate about Jesus himself. For instance, after
Jesus turned water into wine; John tells US, "This, the first of his miraculous
signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee_
and manifested his glory; and his disciples
believed in him'
(John 2.11). It was not the glory of the Holy Spirit that was
manifested but the glory of Jesus himself, as his divine power worked
change watel
into wine.
Similarly; after Jesus stilled the storm on the Sea of
Galilee, the disciples did not say;
How great

but rather; "What sort of man is this_
that even
winds and sea obey him?" (Matt. 8.27). It was the authority of Jesus himself
which the winds and the waves were subject; and this could only be the
authority of God who rules over the seas and has power tO still the waves (cf:
Ps. 65.7; 89.9; 107.29)
Jesus asserts his eternity when he says
Before Abraham was
am" (John
8.58, see discussion above), 01;,
am the Alpha and the Omega" (Rev:
22.13).
The omniscience of Jesus is demonstrated in his knowing people-
thoughts
(Mark 2.8) and seeing Nathaniel under the fig tree from far away (John 1:48),
and knowing
the first who those were that did not believe, and who it
was that would betray him" (John 6.64). Of course, the revelation of

knowledge was much more extensive than that: He knew "who those were
that did not believe,
thus implying that he knew the belief or unbelief that
was in the hearts of all men. In fact; John says explicitly that Jesus
knew all
men and needed no one t0 bear witness of man'
(John 2.25). The disciples
could later say to him;
Now
know that you know all things`
(John
16.30).
These statements say much more than what could be said of any great
prophet 0r apostle of the Old Testament or New Testament; for
imply
omniscience on the part of Jesus_
Finally; after his resurrection, when Jesus asked Peter if he loved him; Peter
answered
Lord,you know
everything
you know thal
love you" (John
21.17). Here Peter is saying much more than that Jesus knows his heart and
knows that he loves him. He is rather making
generab
statement

everything'
and from it he is
specific conclusion
You know that
love you"
Peter is confident that Jesus knows what is in the heart of every
person, and therefore he is sure that Jesus knows his own heart
The divine attribute of omnipresence is not directly affirmed t0 be true of
Jesus during his earthly ministry However; while looking forward to the time
that the church would be established, Jesus
say; "Where tWO Or three are
gathered in my name; there am
in the midst of them" (Matt: 18.20).
Moreover; before he left the earth; he told his disciples_
am with you
always
to the close of the age'
(Matt. 28.20).
That Jesus possessed divine sovereignty;
kind of authority possessed by God
alone, is seen in the fact that he could forgive sins (Mark 2.5-7). Unlike the
Old Testament prophets who declared, "Thus says the LORD;
he could
preface his statements with the phrase_
"But
say [0 you
(Matt: 5.22, 28, 32
34,39
44)
amazing claim to his own authority: He could speak with the
authority of God himself because he was himself fully God. He had "all
delivered into his hands by the Father and the authority to reveal the
Father t0 whomever he chose (Matt: 11:25-27). Such is his authority that the
etemal
state of everyone in the universe depends on whether they
believe in him or reject him (John 3.36).
Jesus also possessed the divine attribute of immortality; the inability t0 die.
We see this indicated near the
beginning of John'$ gospel, when Jesus says to
the Jews_
Destroy this temple, and in three days
will raise it up
(John
2.19). John explains that he was not
speaking about the temple made with
stones in Jerusalem; "but he spoke of the temple of his body When therefore
he was raised from the dead_
his disciples remembered that he had said this;
they
drawing

and
believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken" (John
2.21-22). We must insist of course that Jesus really did die: this
passage
speaks of the time when "he was raised
the dead:
But it is also
significant that Jesus predicts that he will have an active role in his own
resurrection:
raise it up.
Although other Scripture passages tell us that
God the Father was active in raising Christ from the dead, here he says that he
himself will be active in his resurrection.
Jesus claims the powel
to lay down his life and take it up again in another
passage in John's gospel: "For this reason the Father loves me, because

Here Jesus speaks of
power no other human being has had
the power t0
lay down his own life and the power t0 take it up again. Once
this is an
indication that Jesus possessed the divine attribute of immortality:
Similarly;
the author of Hebrews says that Jesus "has become
priest; not according t0
legal
requirement
concerning bodily descent but by the power of an
indestructible life" (Heb: 7:16). (The fact that immortality is
unique
characteristic of God alone is seen in
Tim. 6.16, which speaks of God as the
one
who alone has immortality:
Another clear attestation to the deity of Christ is the fact that he is counted
worthy t0 be worshiped, something that is true of no other creature,
including
angels (see Rev: 19.10), but only God alone: Yet Scripture says of Christ that
"God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above
every name
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow; in heaven and
on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, t0 the
glory of God the Father" (Phil 2.9-11). Similarly, God
commands the angels to worship Christ; for we read, "When he
the
first-born into the world, he says,
Let all God*$ angels worship him'
(Heb_
1.6).
John is allowed
glimpse of the worship that occurs in heaven, for he sees
thousands and thousands of angels and heavenly creatures around God's
throne saying;
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain;
[0 receive power and
wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing-
(Rev:
5.12). Then he hears

and he is
accorded the universal worship offered to God the Father; thus clearly

3. Did Jesus Give Up Some of His Divine Attributes While on Earth?
(The Kenosis Theory) Paul writes to the Philippians,
Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus;
who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with
God
[O be
grasped, but emptied himself;
the form of
servant; being born in the
of men.
(Phil 2.5-7)
Beginning with this text, several theologians in Germany (from about 1860 _
1880) and in England (from about 1890
1910) advocated
view of the
incarnation that had not been advocated before in the history of the church:
This new view was called the "kenosis theory;
and the overall position it
represented was called
kenotic
theology
The kenosis
holds that
Christ
up some of his divine attributes while he was 0n earth as
man:
(The word kenosis is taken from the Greek verb kenoo, which generally
means
to empty;
and is translated "emptied himself" in Phil. 2.7.)
According
t0 the theory Christ
emptied himself" of some of his divine
attributes, such as omniscience
omnipresence;, and omnipotence, while he
was n earth as
man. This was viewed as
voluntary self-limitation 0n
Christ' =
part; which he carried out in order t0 fulfill his work of redemption
But does Philippians 2.7 teach that Christ emptied himself of some of his
divine attributes
and does the rest of the New Testament confirm this? The
evidence of Scripture points t0
negative answer t0 both questions:
We must
first realize that no recognized teacher in the first
800 years of church
history; including those who were native speakers of Greek; thought that
emptied himself" in Philippians 2:7 meant that the Son of God gave up some
of his divine attributes. Second,
muSt recognize that the text does nOt say
that Christ "emptied himself of some powers" or
emptied himself of divine
attributes'
anything like that Third, the text does describe what Jesus did
in this
emptying
he did not do it by giving up any of his attributes but
rather by "taking the form of

that is, by coming

and

(Phil. 2.8) . Thus
the context itself
interprets this

equivalent t0
"humbling himself" and taking on
lowly status and position:
Thus, the NIV, instead of translating the phrase,
"He emptied himself;
translates it, "but made himself nothing
(Phil. 2.7
NIV)
The emptying includes change of role and status; not essential
attributes

gave ,

fourth reason for this interpretation is seen in Paul's purpose in this context:
His purpose has been to persuade the Philippians that they should "do nothing
from selfishness 0r conceit; but in humility count others better than
yourselves'
(Phil. 2.3), and he continues by
them_
"Let each of you
look not only t0 his own interests, but also t0 the interests of others" (Phil_
2.4). To persuade them to be humble and
puc the interests

then holds up the example of Christ: "Have this mind among yourselves;
which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did

but emptied himself; taking
the form of

(Phil. 2.5-7).
Now in
up Christ as an example_
he wants the Philippians t0 imitate
Christ. But certainly he is not asking the Philippian Christians [0

any of their essential attributes or abilities! He is not asking them

Rather; he

And because that is his

[0 understand that he is
Christ as the supreme example of one who did
just that: he put the interests of others first and was
willing to give up some of

Therefore

that
talks about Jesus

speak of Christ who, "though he was rich_
yet for your sake he became
Cor: 8.9) , once again speaking of the privilege and honor that he deserved

The fifth and finab
reason why the "kenosis
view of Philippians 2.7 must be
rejected is the larger
context of the teaching of the New Testament and the
doctrinal
teaching of the entire Bible: If it were true that such

foundationaB
objection against it), then we could no longer affirm Jesus was fully God
while he was here on earth:
The kenosis theory ultimately denies the full
deity of Jesus Christ and makes him something less than fully God. S. M

Christianity; like all human life and thought; is evolving and changing over
time (p. ii) The basic claims of the book are laid out in the first two chapters_
In chapter
Maurice Wiles argues that it is possible to have Christianity
without the doctrine of the incarnation. [he church has given up earlier
doctrines
such as the "real presence
of Christ in the Lord's
inerrancy of Scripture_
and the virgin birth; therefore, it is possible tO give up
the traditional doctrine of the incarnation and still keep the Christian faith as
well (pp. 2-3). Moreover; the doctrine of the incarnation is not directly
presented in Scripture but originated in
setting where belief in the
supernatural was credible; nevertheless, it has never been
coherent or
intelligible doctrine through the history of the church (pp_
3-5).
Regarding the New Testament teaching; Francis Young; in chapter
argues
that the New Testament contains the writings of many diverse witnesses who
tell of their own understanding of Christ, but that no single or unified view of
Christ can be gained from the entire New Testament; the early church '$
understanding of the person of Christ was
developing
in various directions
over time_
Young concludes that the situation
similar today: within the
Christian church many diverse personal responses to the story of Jesus Christ

that sees
Christ as
man in whom God was uniquely at work but not by any
means
man who was also fully God:

evangelical theology;

cases_
the great

Second;

Was Jesus' Deity Necessary? In the previous section
listed
several reasons why
was necessary for Jesus t0 be fully man in order to earn
our redemption. Here it is appropriate [0 recognize that it is crucially
important t0 insist on the full deity of Christ as well, not only because it is
clearly taught in Scripture; but also because
only someone who is infinite

salvation is from the Lord (Jonah 2.9 NASB), and the whole

Tim: 2.5) , both to bring us back to God and also to reveal God most fully to
us (John 14.9).
Thus _
if Jesus is not fully God_
we have no salvation and ultimately no
Christianity. It is no accident that throughout history those groups that have
given up belief in the full deity of Christ have not remained
within the
Christian faith but have soon drifted toward the kind of religion represented
by Unitarianism in the United States and elsewhere: "No one who denies the
Son has the Father" (1 John 2.23).
Any one who goes ahead and does nOt
abide in the doctrine of Christ does nor have God; he who abides in the
doctrine has both the Father and the Son"
(2 John 9).

human minds and spirits (0r souls) as well: Christ had to be fully and truly

Fiyure 26.2
Nestorius was
popular preacher at Antioch; and from AD. 428 was bishop
Constantinople
Although Nestorius himself probably never taught the
heretical view that goes by his name (the idea that Christ was tWo persons in
one body; rather than one person), through
combination of several personal
conflicts and
good deal of ecclesiastical politics
he was removed from his
office of bishop and his teachings were condemned.
It is important
understand why the church
not accept the view that
Christ was tWo distinct persons. Nowhere in Scripture do we have an
indication that the human nature of Christ, for example; is an independent
person;
to do
something contrary to the divine nature of Christ:
Nowhere do we have an indication of the human and divine natures talking t0

And, though we can sometimes distinguish actions of his
divine nature and actions 0f his human nature in order [0 help us understand
some of the statements and actions recorded in Scripture, the Bible itself does
not say

Jesus
divine nature did
though they were separate persons_
but always talks about what the person of
Christ did. Therefore_
the church continued t0 insist that Jesus was one
person, although possessing both
human nature and
divine nature_
Monophysitism (Eutychianism):
third inadequate view is called
monophysitism, the view that Christ had one nature only (Gk monos
one,
and physis
nature" ) The primary advocate of this view in the early church
was Eutyches (C.
AD.378-454), who was the leader of
monastery at
Constantinople. Eutyches taught the opposite error from Nestorianism; for he
denied that the human nature and divine nature in Christ remained fully
human and fully divine.
He held rather that the human nature of Christ was
taken up and absorbed into the divine nature, S0 that both natures were
changed somewhat and
third kind of nature resulted.
Eutychianism can be seen if we put
drop of ink in
glass of water: the
mixture
resulting is neither pure ink nor pure water; but some kind of third
substance
mixture of the tWO in which both the ink and the water are
changed. Similarly, Eutyches taught that Jesus was
mixture of divine and
human elements in which both were somewhat modified t0 form one new

This may be represented as in figure 26.3.

The Solution to the Controversy: The Chalcedonian Definition of A.D

Chalcedon near Constantinople (modern Istanbul),
from October 8 [0

The
resulting statement; called the Chalcedonian
Definition, guarded against Apollinarianism, Nestorianism; and
Eutychianism. It has been taken as the standard_

Some have said that the Chalcedonian Definition really did not define for US
in any positive way what the person of Christ actually is, but simply told us
several things that

The
definition actually did
great deal
to help us understand the biblica_
teaching
correctly: It taught that Christ definitely has two natures,
human nature and
divine nature. It taught that his divine nature
exactly the same as that of
the Father

to the Godhead"
And
it maintained that the human nature is exactly like our human nature, yet
without sin
consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all things

the human nature retains its distinctive characteristics and the divine nature
retains its distinctive characteristics ("the distinction of natures being by no

Combining Specific Biblical Texts 0n Christ's Deity and Humanity:
When we examine the New Testament, as we did above in the sections on
Jesus' humanity and deity; there are several passages that seem difficult to fit
together (How could Jesus be omnipotent and yet weak? How could he leave
the world and yet be present everywhere? How could he learn things and yet
be omniscient?). As the church struggled
understand these teachings, it
cnnsi
thal,
finally came up with the Chalcedonian Definition, which spoke of two
distinct natures in Christ that retain their own properties yet remain together
in one person. This distinction, which helps us in our understanding of the
biblical passages mentioned earlier; also seems to be demanded by those
passages_
One Nature Does Some Things That the Other Nature Does Not Do:
Evangelical theologians in previous generations have not hesitated to
distinguish between things done by Christ'$ human nature but not by his
divine nature, 0r by his divine nature but not by his human nature. It seems
that we have t0 do this if we are
to affirm the Chalcedonian statement
about
the property of each nature being preserved.
But few recent
theologians have been willing to make such distinctions,
perhaps because of _
hesitancy
affirm something we cannot understand_
When we are
about Jesus' human nature; we can say that he ascended
heaven and is no longer in the world (John 16.28; 17:11; Acts 1.9-11)
But with respect to his divine nature_
we can say that Jesus is
everywhere
present: "Where two Or three are gathered in my name_
there am
in the midSt
of them" (Matc. 18.20);
with you always
t0 the close of the age
(Malt:
28.20); "If
man loves me
he will
my word, and my Father will love
him, and we will come t0 him and make our home with him" (John 14.23). So
we can say that both things are true about the person of Christ
he has
returned t0 heaven, and he is also present with 4S
Similarly, we can say that Jesus was about
years old (Luke 3.23), if we
are speaking with respect t0 his human nature; buL we can say that he
eternally existed (John 1:1-2; 8.58) if we are speaking of his divine nature
In his human nature
Jesus was weak and tired (Matt 4.2
8.24; Mark 15.21;
John 4.6) , but in his divine nature he
omnipotent (Matt: 8.26-27; Col.
1.17; Heb: 1.3). Particularly
is the scene on the Sea of Galilee where
Jesus was
in the stern of the
presumably because he was weary
(Matt. 8.24). But he was able t0 arise from his sleep and calm the wind and
sea with
word (Matt 8.26-27)4 Tired yet omnipotent! Here Jesus
weak
human nature completely hid his omnipotence until that omnipotence broke
forth in
sovereign word from the Lord of heaven and earth:
If someone asks whether Jesus
when he was asleep in the boat, was also
continually carrying along all
by his word of power" (Heb_
133
author $ translation) , and whether all things in the universe were being held
together by him at that time (see Col. 1:17), the answer must be yes_

activities have always been and will always be the particular responsibility of
the second person of the Trinity; the eternal Son of God: Those who find the

To this question the answer must also be
Jesus was nOL
potentially God or someone
whom God uniquely worked, but was truly and
fully God, with all the attributes of God. He was
Savior; who is Christ the
Lord" (Luke 2.11). Those who reject this as impossible simply have
different definition of what is
possible" than God has_
as revealed in
Scripture _
To say that we cannot understand this is appropriate humility. But
say that it is not possible seems more like intel
ectual arrogance:
In a similar way; we can understand that in his human nature; Jesus died
(Luke 23.46;
Cor: 15.3).
But with respect to his divine nature, he did not
die, but was able t0 raise himself from the dead (John 2.19; 10.17-18; Heb_
7.16). Yet here
muSt give
note of caution: it is true that when Jesus died
his physicab
body died and his human soul (0r spirit) was separated from his
body and passed into the presence of God the Father in heaven (Luke 23.43,
46). In this way he experienced
death that is like the one we as believers
experience if we die before Christ returns_
And it is not conect t0 say thal
Jesus
divine nature died, 0r could die, if "die'
means
cessation of activity,
cessation of consciousness
diminution of power:
Vevertheless, by virtue
of union with Jesus' human nature, his divine nature somehow tasted
something of what it was like to g0 through death. The person of Christ
experienced death Moreover; it seems difficult to understand how Jesus'
human nature alone could have bore the wrath of God against the sins of
millions 0f people_
seems that Jesus
divine nature had somehow [0
participate in the
of wrath against sin that was due t0 US (though
Scripture nowhere explicitly affirms this).
Therefore,
even
though Jesus'
divine nature did not actually die, Jesus went through the experience of death
whole person
and both human and divine natures somehow shared in
that experience. Beyond
Scripture does not enable us to say more_
The distinction between Jesus
human and divine natures also helps uS
understand Jesus' temptations.
With respect to his human nature
he certainly
was
tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin (Heb. 415). Yet with
respect t0 his divine nature; he was not tempted, because God cannot be
tempted with evil (James 1.13).
At this point it seems necessary t0 say that Jesus had two distinct wills,
human will and
divine will, and that the wills belong
the tWO distinct
natures of Christ; not [O the person. In fact, there was
position, called the

bearing
thal
monothelite view, which held that Jesus had only
one will;
but that was
certainly
minority view in the church, and
was rejected as heretical at
church council in Constantinople in AD: 68. Since then the view that Christ
had two wills (a human will and
divine will) has been generally; but not
universally; held through the church. In fact, Charles Hodge says:
The decision against Nestorius
in which the unity of Christ' $ person
was asserted; that against Eutyches, affirming the distinction of
Maluies
and that against the Monothelites, declaring that the
possession
human nature involves of necessity the possession of
human will, have been received as the true faith by the Church
universal, the Greek; Latin, and Protestant
Hodge explains that the church thought that "to
Christ

was [0

human nature_
0r" was truly
man. Besides_
it precluded
the possibility of his having been tempted_
and therefore contradicted the
Scriptures, and separated him so far from his people he could not sympathize
with them in their temptations
Moreover; Hodge notes that along with the
idea that Christ had two wills is the related idea that he had two centers of
consciousness 0r'
intelligence
As there are [WO distinct natures, human and
divine, there are of necessity tWo intelligences and two wills, the one fallible
and finite_
the other immutable and infinite:
This distinction of tWo wills and two centers of consciousness helps uS
understand
Jesus could learn things and yet know all
On the one
hand
with respect t0 his human nature_
he had limited knowledge (Mark
13.32; Luke 2.52)_
On the other hand_
Jesus clearly knew all
(John
2.25;
16.30; 21.17). Now this is only understandable if Jesus learned
and had limited knowledge with respect t0 his human nature but was always
omniscient with respect t0 his divine nature_
and therefore he was able any
time t0 "call to mind" whatever information would be needed for his ministry.
In this way we can understand Jesus
statement concerning the time of his
return: "But of that day or that hour no one knows
not even the angels in
heaven
nor the Son, but only the Father " (Mark 13.32).
This ignorance of the
time of his return was true of Jesus' human nature and human consciousness
only, for in his divine nature he was certainly omniscient and certainly knew
the time when he would return t0 the earth:
At this point someone may object that if we say that Jesus had tWo centers of
consciousness and tWO wills
that requires that he was two distinct persons;
and we have really fallen into the error of "Nestorianism
But in response_
deny
deny
how
things.
things
things
must simply be affirmed that two wills and two centers of consciousness do
not require that Jesus be two distinct persons. It is mere assertion without
to say that they do. If someone responds that he 0r she does not
understand how Jesus could have [WO centers of consciousness and still be
one person, then that fact may certainly be admitted by all. But failing
understand something does not mean that it is impossible, only that our
understanding
limited.
The great majority of the church throughout its
history has said that Jesus had tWo wills and centers of consciousness, yet he
remained one person. Such
formulation is not impossible, merely
mystery
that we do not now fully understand. To
any other solution would create
far greater problem:
would require that we give Up either the full deity O
the full humanity of Christ, and that we cannot do.
Anything Either Nature Does_
the Person of Christ Does: In the
previous section we mentioned
number of
that were done by one
nature but not the other in the person of Christ: Now we must affirm that
anything that is true of the human or the divine nature
true of the person of
Christ: Thus Jesus can say;
Before Abraham was
am" (John &8.58). He does
not say; "Before Abraham was, my divine nature existed,
because he is free
to talk about anything done by his divine nature alone or his human nature
alone as something that he did.
In the human sphere, this is certainly true of Our conversation as well. If _

That is
[rue because anything that is done by one part of me is done by me:
Thus
Christ died for our sins'
Cor: 15.3).
Even though actually only his
human body ceased living and ceased functioning
it was nonetheless Christ
person who died for our sin. This is simply
means of affirming that
whatever can be said of one nature Or the other can be said of the person of
Christ
Therefore it is correct for Jesus t0 say;
am leaving the world" (John 16.28) ,
am no more in the world" (John 17.11) , but at the same time t0 say,
am with yOu always'
(Matt. 28.20). Anything that is done by one nature or
the other is done by the person of Christ:
Titles That Remind Us One Nature Can Be Used of the Person Even
When the Action Is Done By the Other Nature: The New Testament
authors sometimes use titles that remind US ot either the human nature 0r the
pruof=
adopt =
things
nothing
divine nature in order to speak of the person of Christ, even though the action
mentioned may be done only by the other nature than the one we might think
of from the title. For example, Paul says that if the nulers of this world had
understood the wisdom of God, "they would not have crucified the Lord of
glory
(1 Cor: 2.8). Now when we see the phrase
Lord of glory" it
reminds US
specifically of Jesus
divine nature. But Paul uses this title
(probably intentionally to show the horrible evil of the crucifixion) to say that
Jesus was
cnucified:
Even though Jesus
divine nature was nOt crucified,
was true of Jesus as
person that he was crucified, and Paul affirms that
about him even though he uses the title
the Lord of glory:
Similarly, when Elizabeth calls
"the mother of my Lord
(Luke 1.43),
the name
my Lord" is
title that reminds us of Christ'$ divine nature. Yet
Mary of course is not the mother of Jesus' divine nature; which has always
existed_
Mary
simply the mother of the human nature of Christ:
Nevertheless, Elizabeth can call her "the mother of my Lord" because she is
using the title "Lord" t0 refer to the person of Christ: A similar expression
occurs in Luke 241:
For t0 YOu is born this day in the city of David
Savior;
who is Christ the Lord:
In this way;
understand Mark 13.32_
where Jesus says nO one knows
the time of his retum;
not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only
the Father:-
Though the term "the Son" specifically reminds US of Jesus
heavenly; eternal sonship with God the Father; it is really used here not t0
speak specifically of his divine nature; but tO speak generally of him as
person, and t0 affirm something that is in fact true of his human nature only.
And it is true that in one important sense (that is, with respect to his human
nature_
Jesus did not know the time when he would return:
Brief Summary Sentence: Sometimes in the study of systematic theology;
the following sentence has been used to summarize the incarnation:
Remaining what he was_
he became what he was nOL
In other words
while
Jesus continued "remaining
what he was (that is, fully divine)
he also
became what he previously had not been (that is, fully human as well) Jesus
did not give up any of his deity when he became man, but he did take on
humanity that was not his before_
#Communication" of Attributes: Once we have decided that Jesus
fully man and fully God, and that his human nature remained fully human and
his divine nature remained fully divine,
we can still ask whether there were
some
qualities or abilities that were given (or
communicated"
trom one
nature t0 the other:
seems there were.

(1) From the Divine Nature t0 the Human Nature: Although Jesus
human
nature did not change its essential character; because it was united with the
divine nature in the one person of Christ; Jesus' human nature gained (a)
worthiness to be worshiped and (b) an inability to sin, both of which did not
belong to human beings otherwise.
(2) From the Human Nature t0 the Divine Nature: Jesus

gave him (a) an ability to experience suffering and death; (b) an ability t0

which Jesus as God alone could not have done:
Conclusion: At the end of this
discussion;
may be easy for US [0 lose
sight of what is actually taught in Scripture. It is by far the most amazing
miracle of the entire Bible
-far more
than the resurection and more
amazing even than the creation of the universe
The fact that the infinite
omnipotent;, eternal Son of God could become man and join himself to
human nature forever; SO that infinite God became one person with finite man,
will remain for eternity the most profound miracle and the most profound
mystery in all the universe_
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL
APPLICATION
After reading this chapter; are there specific ways in which yOu now
think of Jesus as being more like YOu than yOu did before? What are
these? How can
clearer
understanding of Jesus' humanity help you face
temptations? How can it help You to pray? What are the most difficult
situations in your life right now? Can you think of any similar situations
that Jesus might have faced? Does that encourage YOu t0 pray
confidently to him? Can you picture what
would have been like if you
had been present when Jesus said, "Before Abraham was_
am
What
would you have felt? Honestly; what would your response have been?
Now try visualizing
as present when Jesus made some of the
other
am" statements recorded in John'$ gospel:
After reading this chapter; is there anything that you understand more
fully about the deity of Jesus? Can yOu describe (and perhaps identify
with) what the disciples must have felt as
came t0
growing
realization of who Jesus actually was? Do you think Jesus is the one
person you would be able t0 trust with your life for all eternity? Will you
happy to join with thousands of others in worshiping around his
throne in heaven? Do you delight in
worshiping him now?

Chapter 22
The Atonement
Was it necessary for Christ t0 die? Did Christ' s entire earthly life
earn any saving benefits for us? The cause and nature of the
atonement Did Christ descend into hell?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We may define the atonement as follows: The atonement is the work Christ
did in his life and death to earn our salvation. This definition indicates that
we are
the word atonement in
broader sense than it is sometimes used.
Sometimes
used t0 refer only t0 Jesus' dying and paying for our sins on
the crOSS_
But, as will be seen below; since saving benefits also come [0 4S
from Christ'$ life, we have included that in our definition as well
WneEE
Anneinemg
What was the ultimate cause that led to Christ' $
earth and
dying for
our sins? To find this we must trace the question back to
something
in the
character of God himself: And here Scripture points t0
things: the love
and justice of God.
The love of God as
cause of the atonement
seen in the most familiar
passage in the Bible: "For God so loved the world that he
his only Son,
that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life'
(John
3.16). But the justice of God also required that God find
way thal the
penalty due t0 us for our sins would be paid (for he could not accept 4S into
fellowship with himself unless the penalty was paid) Paul explains that this
was why God sent Christ t0 be
propitiation'
(Rom_
3.25 NASB) (that is,
sacrifice that bears God $ wrath s0 that God becomes "propitious
favorably disposed toward us): it was "t0 show God s righteousness, because
in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins
(Rom 3.25). Here
Paul says that God had been forgiving sins in the Old Testament but no
penalty had been paid
fact that would make people wonder whether
was indeed just and ask how he could forgive sins without
penalty. No God
using
coming.
gave
God
who was truly just could do
could he? Yer when God sent Christ t0 die
and pay the penalty for our sins,
"it was t0 prove at the present time that he
himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus'
(Rom
3.26).
Therefore both the love and the
justice of God were the ultimate cause of the
atonement. It is not helpful for uS t0 ask which is more important; however;
because without the love of God_
he would never have taken any steps to
redeem US, yet without the justice of God, the specific requirement that Christ
should eam Our salvation by dying for OuI sins would not have been met.
Both the love and the
ustice of God were equally important
The Necestir
Was there any other way for God to save human beings than by sending his
Son
die in our
place?
Before answering this question_
it is important t0 realize that it was not
necessary for God tO save any people at all:
When we
appreciate that
God
did not spare the angels when they sinned_
but cast them into hell and
committed them to pits of nether gloom to be
until the judgment"
Peter 2.4), then we realize that God could also have chosen with perfect
justice to have left us in our sins awaiting judgment: he could have chosen to
save no one, just as he did with the sinful
angels.
So in this sense the
atonement was nO
absolutely necessary:
But once God, in his love, decided to save some human beings
then several
passages in Scripture indicate that there was n other way for God t0 do this
than through the death of his Son. Therefore
the atonement was nOC
absolutely necessary; but; as
consequence
of God $ decision
Sd€ sumE
human
beings, the atonement was absolutely necessary This is sometimes
called the
consequent absolute necessity" view of the atonement:
In the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus prays_
"If ic be possible, let this cup pass
from me; nevertheless; not as
will, but as YOu will" (Matt: 26.39). We may
be confident that Jesus always prayed according to the will of the Father; and
that he always prayed with fullness of faith Thus
seems that this prayer;
which Matthew takes
record fOr US
shows thar
was not possible for
Jesus [0 avoid the death on the cross
which was soon
[0 come t0 him (the
cup"
suffering that he had said would be
If he was going to
accomplish the work that the Father sent him tO do, and if people were going
be redeemed for God
then it was necessary for him to die on the cross_
that;
kepi
pains
his).
He said
something similar after his resurrection, when he was talking with
DYO
disciples on the road to Emmaus. They were sad that Jesus had died, but
his response was_
"0 foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the
prophets have spoken! Was
not necessary that the Christ should suffer these
things and enter into his glory?
(Luke 24.25-26). Jesus understood that
God's plan of redemption (which he explained for the disciples from many
Old Testament Scriptures; Luke 24.27) made it necessary for the Messiah to
die for the sins of his people.
As we saw above_
Paul in Romans 3 also shows that if God were t0 be
righteous, and still save people, he had to send Christ tO pay the penalty for
sins: "It was t0 prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that
he justifies him who has faith in Jesus" (Rom 3.26). The
[0 the
Hebrews emphasizes that Christ had tO suffer for 0ur sins: "He had to be
made like his brethren in every respect; S0 that he might become
merciful
and faithful high priest
the service ot God,
make expiation [lit.
'propitiation
for the sins of the people" (Heb: 2.17). The author of Hebrews
also argues that since "it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should
take away sins
(Heb. 10.4),
better sacrifice is required (Heb 9.23). Only
the blood of Christ; that is, his death; would be able really t0 take away sins
(Heb. 9.25-26). There was no other way for God t0 save US than for Christ t0
die in our place:
Nte
In this section we consider tWo aspects of Christ's work: (1) Christ's
obedience for us, in which he obeyed the requirements of the law in our place
and was perfectly obedient t0 the will of God the Father as OUI representative_
and
Christ'$ sufferings for US
in which he took the penalty due for 0ur
sins and as
result died fOr 0uT sins.
It is important t0 notice that in both of these categories the primary emphasis
and the primary influence of Christ'$ work of redemption is nOt On US, but 0n
God the Father: Jesus obeyed the Father in our place and perfectly met the
demands of the law: And he suffered in our place;
receiving
in himself the
penalty that God the Father would have visited upon us_
In both cases_
the
atonement is viewed as objective; that is, something that has primary
influence directly on God himself: Only secondarily does it have application
[0 4S, and this
only because there was
definite event in the relationship
between God the Father and God the Son that secured
salvation:
Christ'$ Obedience for Us (Sometimes Called His
Active Obedience"
If Christ had only earned
forgiveness of sins for US, then we would not merit

heaven_
Our guilc
would have been removed, but we would simply be in the
position of Adam and Eve before they had done anything good or bad and
before they had passed
time of probation successfully To be established in
righteousness forever and to have their fellowship with God made sure
forever; Adam and Eve had to obey God perfectly over
period of time. Then
God would have looked on their faithful obedience with pleasure and delight;
and they would have lived with him in fellowship forever:
For this reason, Christ had to live
life of perfect obedience to God in order
0 earn
righteousness for uS_
He had t0 obey the law for his whole life on our
behalf so that the positive merits of his perfect obedience would be counted
for uS . Sometimes this is called Christ'$
active Obedience _
while his
suffering and dying for Our sins is called his ""passive obedience.

having
righteousness of
[his] own, based on law; but that which is through faith in Christ; the
righteousness from God that depends on faith" (Phil 3.9) It is not just moral
neutrality that Paul knows he needs from Christ (that is,
clean slate with sins
forgiven), but
positive moral
righteousness:
And he knows that that cannot
come from himself; but must come through faith in Christ. Similarly; Paul
says that Christ has been made
our righteousness"
Cor: 1.30). And he
quite explicitly says;
For as by one man'
disobedience many were made
sinners_
so by one man
obedience many will be made righteous
(Rom:
5.19).
Some
theologians have not taught that Christ needed to achieve
record
perfect obedience for uS
They have simply emphasized that Christ
had to die and thereby pay the penalty for our sins_
But such
position does
not adequately explain why Christ did more than just die for us; he also
became
"righteousness'
before God: Jesus said t0 John the Baptist; before
he was baptized by him; "It is fitting for US t0 fulfil all righteousness
(Matt.
3.15).
It might be argued that Christ had to live
life of perfect righteousness for his
own sake; not for ours
before he could be
sinless sacrifice for uS. But Jesus
had no need t0 live
life of perfect obedience for his Own sake
he had
shared love and fellowship with the Father for all eternity and was in his Own
character eternally worthy of the Father'=
good pleasure and delight He rather
had to "fulfill all righteousness" for 0ur sake; that is, for the sake of the
people whom he
representing as their head_
Unless he had done this for
would have no record of obedience by which we would merit God s
favor and merit eternal life with him. Moreover; if Jesus had needed only
goal
lifelong
our
sinlessness and not also
life of perfect obedience
he could have died for uS
when he was
young child rather than when he was thirty-three years old:
By way of application,
ought to ask ourselves whose
record of
obedience we would rather rely on for ouI
before God, Christ'$ 0r
our own? As we think about the life of Christ; we ought to ask ourselves
was
it good enough to deserve God'$ approval? And are we willing to rely on his
record of obedience for 0ur eteral destiny?
Christ'$ Sufferings for Us (Sometimes Called His
Passive
Obedience
In addition t0 obeying the law perfectly for his whole life on
our behalf, Christ also took on himself the sufferings necessary tO pay the
penalty for our sins:
Suffering for His Whole Life: In _
broad sense the penalty Christ bore in
paying for our sins was
suffering in both his body and soul throughout his
life: Though Christ's sufferings culminated in his death on the cross (see
below), his whole life in
fallen world involved suffering: For example
Jesus
endured tremendous suffering during the temptation in the wilderness (Matt.
4.1-11), when he was assaulted for forty
by the attacks of Satan
He
also suffered
growing
maturity,
Although he was
he learned
obedience through what he suffered" (Heb. 5.8). He knew suffering in the
intense
opposition he faced
Jewish
leaders throughout much of his
earthly ministry (see Heb 12.3-4).
We may suppose tOO that he experienced
suffering and grief at the death of his earthly father;
and certainly he
experienced
at the death of his close friend Lazanus (John 11.35). In
predicting the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah said he would be
man of
sorrows, and acquainted with
(Isa. 53.3).
b: The Pain of the Cross: The sufferings of Jesus intensified as he drew near
[0 the cross
He told his disciples of
something
of the agony he was going
through when he said,
My soul is very sorrowful, even to death" (Matt:
26.38). It was especially on the cross that Jesus
sufferings for US reached
their climax, for it was there that he bore the penalty for our sin and died in
our place. Scripture teaches us that there were four different aspects of the
pain that Jesus experienced:
(1)Physical Pain and Death: We do not need to hold that Jesus suffered

Many readers of the Gospels
the ancient world would have witnessed
crucifixions and thus would have had
painfully vivid mental picture upon
reading the simple words
And they crucified him'
(Mark 15.24). A criminal
who was cnucified was essentially forced t0 inflict upon himself
very slow
death by suffocation.
When the criminal $ arms were outstretched and
fastened by nails [0 the crOss, he had t0 support mOst 0f the weight of
body with his arms
The chest cavity would be pulled upward and outward,
it difficult t0 exhale in order t0 be able t0 draw
fresh breath:
But
when the victim's longing for oxygen became unbearable_
he would have t0
himself up with his feet; thus giving more natural support t0 the weight
of his body; releasing some of the weight from his arms
and
his
chest cavity tO contract more normally. By
pushing himself upward in this
way the criminal could fend off suffocation, but it was extremely painful
because
required putting the body's weight on the nails
the
and
the elbows and pulling upward on the nails driven through the
wrists_
The criminal's back, which had been torn open repeatedly by
previous
flogging; would scrape
the wooden cross with each breath:
Thus Seneca (first century A.D:)
crucified man
the
breath of life amid
drawn-out
(Epistle 101_
to Lucilius, section
14).
A physician
the Journal of the American Medical Association in
1986 explained the pain that would have been experienced in death by
crucifixion:
Adequate exhalation required
the body by pushing up on the
feet and by flexing the elbows
However; this maneuver would
place the entire weight of the body on the tarsals and would produce
searing pain. Furthermore_
flexion of the elbows would cause roration
ot the wrists about the iron nails and cause
pain along the
damaged median nerves_
Muscle cramps and paresthesias of the
outstretched and uplifted arms would add to the discomfort: As
result; each respiratory effort would become agonizing and tiring and
lead eventually to asphyxia_
In some cases, crucified men would survive for several days; nearly
suffocating but not
dying: This was why the executioners would
sometimes break the
criminal, so that death would come quickly; as
we see in John 19.31-33:

(2) The Pain of Bearing Sin: More awful than the pain of physical suffering
that Jesus endured was the psychological pain of bearing the
for our sin:
In ouF Own
experience as Christians we know something of the
anguish
feel
when we know we have sinned The weight of
guilt is heavy on OUT
hearts_
and there is
bitter sense of separation from all that is right in the
universe_
an awareness of
something that in a very
sense
ought not to be
the more
grow in holiness as God $ children, the more intensely
we feel this instinctive revulsion against evil.
Now Jesus was perfectly holy: He hated sin with his entire being:
The thought
of evil, of sin_
contradicted
everything in his character: Far more than we =
Jesus instinctively rebelled against =
Yet in obedience t0 the Father; and
out of love for US, Jesus tok on himself all the sins of those who would
someday be saved: Taking on himself all the evil
which his soul
rebelled created deep revulsion in the center of his being: All that he hated
most deeply was poured out fully upon him:
Scripture frequently says that our sins were put on Christ:
The LORD has laid
on him the iniquity of us all" (Isa. 53.6), and "He bore the sin of many" (Isa
53.12). John the Baptist calls Jesus
Lamb of God, who takes away the sin
of the world" (John 1.29). Paul declares that God made Christ
[0 be sin`
Cor: 5.21) and that Christ became
curse for uS'
(Gal:. 3.13). The author of
Hebrews says that Christ was
offered once to bear the sins of many" (Heb.
9.28). And Peter says; "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
Peter 2.24).
The passage from
Corinthians quoted above, together with the verses from
Isaiah; indicate that it was God the Father who put our sins on Christ: HOw
could that be?
the same way in which Adam

imputed [0 4S,
God imputed Our sins to Christ; that is, he thought of them as belonging to
Christ; and, since God is the ultimate judge and definer of what really is in the
universe_
when God thought of our sins as belonging to Christ then in fact
they actually did
belong
Christ: This does not mean that God thought that
Christ had himself committed the sins_
or that Christ himself actually had

but rather that the

Some have objected that it was not fair for God to do this_
transfer the
of sin from uS tO an innocent person,
Christ. Yet we muSt remember that
Christ voluntarily took on himself the
for our sins
so this objection loses
much of its force. Moreover; God himself (Father; Son, and Holy Spirit) is the
ultimate standard of what is just and fair in the universe
and he decreed thar
the atonement would take place in this way; and that it did in fact satisfy the
demands of his own righteousness and justice_
(3) Abandonment: The physical pain of crucifixion and the pain of
himself the absolute evil of Our sins were aggravated by the fact that Jesus
faced this pain alone_
In the Garden of Gethsemane; when Jesus took with
him Peter; James and John; he confided something of his agony
them:
soul is very SOrTowful, even to death; remain here, and watch" (Mark 14.34).
This is the kind of confidence one would disclose [0
close friend, and it
implies
request for support in his hour of greatest trial. Yet as soon as Jesus
was arrested, "all the disciples forsook him and fled" (Matt: 26.56).
Here also there is
very faint
in our experience
for we cannor live
without tasting the inward ache of rejection, whether it be rejection by
close friend, by
parent or child_
or Dy
wife 0r husband. Yet in all those
cases there is at least
sense that we could have done
something differently;
that at least
small part we may be at fault: It was not SO with Jesus and the
disciples_
for; "having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them t0
the end" (John 13.1)_
He had done
but love them; in retur;
abandoned him:
But far worse than desertion by even the closest of human friends was the fact
that Jesus was deprived of the closeness to the Father that had been the
deepest joy of his heart for all his earthly life_
When Jesus cried out "Eli, Eli,
lama sabach-thani?" that is,
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
(Matt: 27.46), he showed that he was finally cut off from the sweet fellowship
with his heavenly Father that had been the unfailing source of his inward
strength and the element of greatest joy in
life filled with SOrrow: As Jesus
bore our sins 0n the cross_
he was abandoned by his heavenly Father; who is
"of purer eyes than to behold evil" (Hab: 1:13). He faced the weight of the
of millions of sins alone:
Bearing the Wrath of God: Yet more difficult than these three previous
aspects of Jesus
Was
the pain of
the wrath of God upon himself:
As Jesus bore the guilt of our sins alone, God the Father; the mighty Creator;

the Lord of the universe, poured out on Jesus the
of his wrath: Jesus
became the object of the intense hatred of sin and vengeance against sin
which God had patiently stored up since the beginning of the world:
Romans 3.25 tells us that God put forward Christ as
propitiation"
(NASB)
word that means
sacrifice that bears God $ wrath t0 the end and in s0
doing changes God's wrath toward us into favor:
Paul tells us that "This was
to show God $ righteousness_
because in his divine forbearance he had passed
over formel
sins; it was
prove at the present time that he himselt is
righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus'
(Rom. 3.25-26).
God had not simply
forgiven sin and forgotten about the punishment in
generations past. He had forgiven sins and stored up his righteous anger
against those sins. But at the cross the fury of all that stored-Up wrath against
sin was unleashed against God'$ own Son.
Many theologians outside the evangelical world have strongly objected to the
idea that Jesus bore the wrath of God against sin_
Their basic assumption is
that since God is
God of love
it would be inconsistent with his character t0
show wrath against the human beings he has created and for whom he is a
loving Father: But evangelical scholars have convincingly
that the idea
of the wrath of God
solidly rooted in both the Old and New Testaments:
"The whole of the argument of the opening part of Romans is that all men,
Gentiles and Jews alike, are sinners_
and that they come under the wrath and
the condemnation of God.
Three other crucial passages in the New Testament refer t0 Jesus' death as
propitiation'
Hebrews 2.17;
John 2.2; and 410. The Greek terms (the
verb hilaskomai, "tO make propitiation" and the noun hilasmos,
sacrifice of
propitiation'
used in these passages have the sense of -
sacrifice that turns
away the wrath ot God
and thereby makes God propitious (0r favorable)
toward uS
This is the consistent
of these words outside the Bible
where they were well understood in reference to pagan Greek religions. These
verses simply mean that Jesus bore the Wrath of God against sin_
It is important t0 insist on this fact; because it is the heart of the doctrine of
the atonement
means that there is an eteral, unchangeable requirement in
the holiness and justice of God that sin be paid for: Furthermore, before the
atonement ever could have an effect on our subjective consciousness, it first
had an effect on God and his relation t0 the sinners he planned tO redeem
Apart from this central truth, the death of Christ really cannot be adequately
understood (see discussion of other views of the atonement below)
fury
aigued
meaning
Although we must be cautious in suggesting any
analogies to the experience
Christ went through (for his experience was and always will be without
precedent 0r comparison), nonetheless, all our understanding of Jesus
suffering comes in some sense by way of
analogous experiences in our life
for that is how God teaches uS in Scripture:
Once again our human
experience provides
very faint
that helps us understand what it
means [0 bear the wrath of God:
Perhaps as children we have faced the wrath
human father when we have done wrong;
perhaps as adults we have
known the anger of an employer because of
mistake we have made:
We are
inwardly shaken
disturbed by the
of another personality; filled with
displeasure
into our very selves
and we tremble. We can hardly imagine the
personal disintegration that would threaten if the outpouring of wrath came
not from some finite human
being but from Almighty God. If even the
presence of God when he does not manifest wrath arouses fear and
trembling
in people (cf: Heb. 12.21, 28
29), how terrible
must be [0 face the presence
wrathful God (Heb. 10.31).
With this in mind_
we are nOw better able to understand Jesus' cry of
desolation, "My God_
my God, why have yOu forsaken me?" (Matt. 27.46b).
The question does not mean; "Why have YOu left me forever?" for Jesus knew
that he was
the world, that he was going tO the Father (John 14.28;
16.10, 17). Jesus knew that he would rise
(John 2.19; Luke 18.33; Mark
9.31; et al.) It was "for the joy that was set before him" that Jesus
endured
the cross, despising the shame; and is seated at the right hand of the throne of
God" (Heb: 12.2). Jesus knew that he could still call God
God:
This cry
of desolation is nOt

does not imply that Jesus wondered why he was dying: He had
said, "The Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and t0 give his

Yet the psalmist was eventually rescued by God, and his cry of desolation
turned into
hymn of praise (vV 22-31). Jesus
who knew the words of
Scripture as his Own, knew well the context of Psalm 22. In quoting this
psalm, he is quoting
cry of desolation that also has implicit in its context an
unremitting faith in the God who will ultimately deliver him. Nevertheless
remains
very real cry of anguish because the
suffering has

and no release is in sight
With this context for the quoration
is better t0 understand the question
"Why have you forsaken
meaning; "Why have you left me for s0
This is the sense it has in Psalm 22. Jesus
in his human nature, knew
he would have t0 bear our sins;
suffer and t0 die.
But, in his human
consciousness, he probably did not know how long this suffering would take:
Yet to bear the guilt of millions of sins
for
moment would cause the
greatest anguish of soul. To face the
and furious wrath of an infinite God
even for an instant would cause the most profound fear: But Jesus
suffering

be yet more weight of sin? Yet more wrath of God? Hour after hour it went on
the dark weight of sin and the
wrath of God poured over Jesus in
wave after wave. Jesus at last cried out; "My God, my God, why have YOu
forsaken me?" Why must this suffering go 0n s0 long? Oh God, my God,
You ever
bring
tO an end?
Then at last Jesus knew his suffering was nearing completion He knew he
had consciously borne all the wrath of the Father against Our sins, for God's
anger had abated and the awful heaviness of sin was
removed_
He knew
that all that remained was to yield up his spirit t0 his heavenly Father and die:
With
shout of victory Jesus cried out; "It is finished!" (John 19.30). Then
with
loud voice he once more cried ouL; "Father; into your hands
commit
my spirit!" (Luke 23.46).
And then he voluntarily gave up the life that no one
could take from him (John 10.17-18), and he died_
As Isaiah had predicted,
"he poured out his soul tO death" and "bore the sin of many" (Isa. 53.12). God
the Father Saw "the fruit of the travail of his soul" and was
'satisfied" (Isa_
53.11).
Further Understanding of the Death of Christ:
The Penalty Was Inflicted By God the Father: If we ask; "Who
required Christ t0 pay the penalty for our sins?" the answer given by Scripture
is that the penalty was inflicted by God the Father as he represented the
interests of the Trinity in redemption. It was God's justice that required that
sin be paid fOr; and, among the members of the Trinity; it was God the Father

whose role was t0 require that payment God the Son voluntarily took upon
himself the role of bearing the penalty for sin. Referring to God the Father;
Paul says, "For Our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin [that is_
Christ] , s0 that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor:
5.21). Isaiah said, " The LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isa
53.6). He goes on t0 describe the
sufferings of Christ:
Yet it was the
the LORD t0 bruise
he has put him to
(Isa. 53.10).
Herein

redemption. Not only did Jesus know that he would bear the
incredible
of the Cross, but God the Father also knew that he would have
to inflict this pain on his own deeply loved Son. "God shows his love for us in
that while
were yet sinners Christ died for us
(Rom: 5.8).
Not Eternal
Suffering but Complete Payment: If we had to pay the
penalty for 0ur own sins
we would have to suffer eternally in separation from
God
However; Jesus did not suffer eternally There are
[WO reasons
for this
difference: (a) If we suffered for our Own sins
we would never be able t0
make ourselves right with God again. There would be no hope because there
would be no way t0 live
and earn perfect righteousness before God_
and
there would be no way to undo our sinful nature and make
right before God.
Moreover; we would continue t0 exist as sinners who would not suffer with
hearts of righteousness before God, but would suffer with resentment
and bitterness
God
thus continually compounding our sin.
(b) Jesus
was able to bear all the wrath of God against our sin and to bear it to the end:
No mere man could ever have done this_
but by virtue of the union of divine
and human natures in himself; Jesus was able to bear all the wrath of God
against sin and bear it tO the end. Isaiah predicted that God
shall see the fruit
of the travail of his soul and be satisfied" (Isa. 53.11). When Jesus knew that
he had paid the full penalty for our sin, he said, "It is finished " (John 19.30).
If Christ had not paid the full penalty, there would still be condemnation left
for WS_
But since he has paid the full penalty that is due to uS,
There is
therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom:
8.1).
It should help us at this point to realize that
in the eternal character of
God and nothing in the laws God had given for mankind required that there
be eternal suffering
pay for man'$ sins_
In fact,
there is eternal
suffering_
it simply shows that the penalty has never been fully
and that the
evildoer continues t0 be
sinner by nature
But when Christ'$ sufferings at

of God
wrath against sin and there was no penalty left [O pay: It also showed

paid;
that he was himself righteous before God In this way the fact that Christ
suffered for
limited time rather than eternally shows that his suffering was
sufficient payment for sins. The author of Hebrews repeats this theme again
and again,
emphasizing the completion and the finality of Christ's redemptive
work:
Nor was
tO offer himself repeatedly; as the
priest enters the
Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; for then he would have had
suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world_
But as it is, he
has appeared once for all at the end of the age to
away sin by the
sacrifice of himself.
Christ;
been offered once t0 bear the
sins of many; will appear
second time
nOr [0 deal with sin but t0
save those who are eagerly
waiting for him: (Heb 9.25-28)
This New Testament emphasis on the completion and finality of Christ' $
sacrificial death stands in contrast t0 the Roman Catholic teaching that in the
Mass
there is
repetition of the sacrifice of Christ -
Because of this official
of the Roman Catholic Church; many Protestants since the
Reformation_
and still today; are convinced that they cannot in good
conscience actually participate in the Roman Catholic mass_
because it would
seem [0 be an endorsement of the Catholic view that the sacrifice of Christ is
repeated every time the mass
offered:
The New Testament emphasis on the completion and finality of Christ' $
sacrifice of himself for US has much practical application_
because
assures
uS that there is no more penalty for sin left for US t0 pay: The penalty has
entirely been
by Christ, and we should have no remaining fear of
condemnation or punishment:
(3) The Meaning of the Blood of Christ: The New Testament frequently
connects the blood of Christ with our redemption For example; Peter says
"You know that You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your
fathers
not with perishable
such as silver or
but with the precious
blood of Christ; like that of
lamb without blemish or
(1 Peter 1.18-
19).
The blood of Christ is the clear outward evidence that his life blood was
poured out when he died
sacrificial death t0 pay for Our redemption
"the
blood of Christ" means his death in its saving aspects:
Although we may
think that Christ $ blood (as evidence that his life had been given) would have
exclusive reference t0 the removal of our judicial
before God
for this is
its primary reference
the New Testament authors also attribute [0
several

other effects- By the blood of Christ our consciences are cleansed (Heb. 9.14),
we gain bold access t0 God in worship and prayer (Heb. 10:19), we are
progressively cleansed from remaining sin (1 John 1:7; cf. Rev: 1:5b), we are
able
conquer the accuser of the brethren (Rev: 12.10-11), and
we are
rescued out of
sinful way of life
Peter 1.18-19).
Scripture
So much about the blood of Christ because its
shedding
was
very clear evidence that his life was being given in judicial execution (that is,
he was condemned t0 death and died paying
penalty imposed both by an
earthly human judge and by God himself in heaven) . Scripture
emphasis on
the blood of Christ also shows the clear connection berween Christ $ death
and the many sacrifices in the Old Testament that involved the pouring out of
the life blood of the sacrificial animal. These sacrifices all pointed forward
and
prefigured the death of Christ.
(4) Christ's Death as "Penal Substitution
The view of Christ'$ death
presented here has frequently been called the
penal substitution:
Christ'$ death was "penal" in that he bore
penalty when he died His death
was also
substitution" in that he was
substitute for US when he died This
has been the orthodox understanding of the atonement held by
evangelical
theologians_
in contrast tO other views that attempt to explain the atonement
apart from the idea of the wrath of God or payment of the penalty for sin (see
below)
This view of the atonement is sometimes called the theory of vicarious
atonement:
vicar " is someone who stands in the place of another or who
represents another: Christ'$ death was therefore "vicarious'
because he stood
in our place and represented uS
As our representative, he took the penalty that
we deserve_
New Testament 'Terms

The
work of Christ is

It can therefore be viewed from severaB

The New Testament
uses different words

important terms:

3. We are separated from God by our sins_
We are in bondage to sin and to the kingdom of Satan:
These four needs are met by Christ'$ death in the
following ways:
Sacrifice: To pay the penalty of death that we deserved because of our
sins
Christ died as
sacrifice for Us. "He has appeared once for all at the end
of the age t0 put away sin by the sacrifice of himself"
(Heb: 9.26).
(2) Propitiation: To remove US from the wrath of God that we deserved,
Christ died as
propitiation for our sins_
"In this is love
not that we loved
God
but that He loved us and sent His Son t0 be the propitiation for 0uI sins'
John 410 NASB):
Reconciliation: To overcome OUr separation from God,
needed
someone t0
provide reconciliation and thereby bring us back into fellowship
with God. Paul says that God "through Christ reconciled us to himself and
gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that
in Christ God was
reconciling
the world t0 himself" (2 Cor: 5.18-19).
Redemption: Because we as sinners are in bondage

we need someone [0

speak of redemption, the idea of
"ransom"
comes into
view:
ransom is the price paid to redeem someone from bondage or
captivity. Jesus said of himself; "For the Son of man also came not tO be
served but [0 serve
and t0 give his life as
ransom for many
(Mark 10.45).
It we ask t0 whom the ransom was paid_
we realize that the human analogy of
ransom payment does not fit the atonement of Christ in every detail. Though
we were in
sin and t0 Satan; there was no "ransom'
either 0
"sin'
or' t0 Satan himself, for
did not have power t0 demand such
payment; nor was Satan the one whose holiness was offended by sin and who
required
penalty to be paid for sin.
As we saw earlier; the penalty for sin
was paid by Christ and received and accepted by God the Father: But we
hesitate to speak of paying
"ransom'
to God the Father; because it was not
he who held US
bondage but Satan and Our Own sins_
Therefore at this point
the idea of
ransom payment cannot be pressed in every detail: It is sufficient
[0 note that
was
(the death of Christ) and the result was that we
were
redeemed" from bondage_
We were redeemed from
to Satan because "the whole world is in the
power of the evil one" (1 John 5.19), and when Christ came he died to
"deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage
bondage
paid
they
price
paid
bondage
(Heb. 2.15). In fact; God the Father "has delivered us from the dominion of
darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son" (Col. 1:13)
As for deliverance from
to sin, Paul says
So you also must consider
yourselves dead tO sin and alive t0 God in Christ Jesus_
For sin will have
no dominion over YOu, since YOu are not under law but under grace
(Rom:
6.11, 14). We have been delivered from bondage to the
of sin and from
bondage t0 its ruling power in our lives_
Other Views of the Atonement: In contrast t0 the
substitution view
of the atonement presented in this chapter;
Severa
other views have been
advocated in the history of the church:
(1) The Ransom to Satan
This view was held by Origen (c. AD_
185
254),
theologian from Alexandria and later Caesarea, and after him
by some others in the early history of the church_
According -
[0 this view, the
ransom Christ paid tO redeem US was paid to Satan, in whose kingdom all
people were by virtue of sin.
This theory finds no direct confirmation in Scripture and has few supporters
in the history of the church: It falsely thinks of Satan rather than God as the
one who
required that
payment be made for sin and thus completely
neglects the demands of God'$ justice with respect tO sin_
It views Satan as
having much more power than he actually does, namely; power to demand
whatever he wants trom God, rather than as one who has been cast down from
heaven and has no right to demand
anything of God. Nowhere does Scripture
say that we as sinners Owe anything to Satan_
but it repeatedly says that God
requires of uS
payment for OuI sins_
This view also fails t0 deal with the
texts that speak ot Christ'$ death as
propitiation offered to God the Father
for OuI sins;
with the fact that God the Father represented the Trinity in
accepting the payment for sins from Christ (see discussion above)
(2) The Moral Influence Theory: First advocated by Peter Abelard (1079_
1142),
French theologian
the moral influence theory of the atonement holds
that God did not require the payment of
penalty for sin; but that Christ'$
death was simply
way in which God showed how much he loved human
beings by identifying with their sufferings,
even [0 the
point of death Christ'$
death therefore becomes
great
example that shows God's love t0 uS
and draws from US
response, SO thar
loving him we are forgiven.
The great difficulty with this viewpoint is that
is contrary t0 50 many
passages of Scripture that speak of Christ dying for sin;
OuI Sin_
dying as
propitiation. Moreover; it robs the atonement of itS objective
bondage
guilt
penal
Theory:

bearing
character; because it holds that the atonement had no effect on God himself:
Finally; it has no way of
dealing with our guilt-_if Christ did not die to pay
for 0ur sins,
have no right tO trust in him for forgiveness of sins:
(3) The Example Theory: The example theory of the atonement was taught
by the Socinians
the followers of Faustus Socinus (1539-1604), an Italian
theologian who settled in Poland in 1578 and attracted
wide following:
The example theory, like the moral influence theory; also denies that God's
justice requires payment for sin;
says that Christ $ death simply provides uS
with an example of how we should trust and
God perfectly; even
that
trust and obedience leads t0
horrible death: Whereas the moral influence
theory says thar Christ'$ death teaches US how much God loves uS_
example theory says that Christ's death teaches us how we should live_
Support for this view could be found in
Peter 2.21,
"For tO this you have
been called_
because Christ also suffered for you,
you an example
that You should follow in his steps.
While it is true that Christ is an example for uS even in his death, the question
is whether this fact is the complete explanation of the atonement The
example theory fails t0 account for the many Scriptures that focus on Christ' $
death as -
payment for sin_
the fact that Christ bore 0ur sins_
and the fact that
he was the propitiation for 0uI sins_
These considerations alone mean that the
theory must be rejected_
Moreover; this view really ends up arguing that man
can save
himself by following Christ'$ example and by trusting and obeying
God just as Christ did:
Thus
fails t0 show how the
our sin can be
removed_
because it does not hold that Christ actually
the penalty for our
sins or made provision for Our guilt when he died
(4) The Governmental Theory: The governmental theory of the atonement
was first taught by
Dutch theologian and jurist;
Grotius (1583-1645).
This theory holds that God did not actually have to require payment for sin,
since he was omnipotent God, he could have set aside that requirement
and simply
forgiven sins without the payment of
penalty. Then what was the
purpose of Christ'$ death? It was God $ demonstration of the fact that his laws
had been broken; that he is the moral lawgiver and governor of the universe,
and that some kind of penalty would be required whenever his laws were
broken. Thus Christ did not exactly pay the penalty for the actual sins of any
people_
but simply suffered t0 show that when God s laws are broken there
must be some penalty
The problem with this view
is that it fails t0 account adequately for all
the Scriptures that speak of Christ bearing our sins on the cross, of God laying

on Christ the iniquity of us all; of Christ dying specifically for our sins; and of
Christ being the propitiation for our sins. Moreover; it takes away the
objective character of the atonement by making its purpose not the
satisfaction of God $ justice but simply that of
influencing
uS t0 realize that
God has laws that must be kept: This view also implies that we cannot rightly
trust in Christ's completed work for forgiveness of sin, because he has nOt
actually made payment for those sins. Moreover; it makes the actual
forgiveness for us something that happened in God s own mind apart from
the death of Christ on the crOsS
he had already decided to forgive us without
requiring any penalty from us and then punished Christ only t0 demonstrate
that he was still the moral govemor of the universe_
But this means that Christ
(in this view) did not actually earn
forgiveness Or salvation for US, and thus
the value of his redemptive work is greatly minimized. Finally; this theory
fails t0 (ake
adequate account of the unchangeableness of God and the infinite
purity of his justice.
To say that God can
forgive sins without requiring any
penalty (in spite of the fact that throughout Scripture sin always requires the
payment of
penalty) is seriously t0 underestimate the absolute character of
the justice of God.
Did Christ Descend Into Hell?
It is sometimes
that Christ
descended into hell after he died_
The phrase "he descended into hell" does
not occur in the Bible_
But the widely used Apostles
Creed reads
"was
crucified, dead, and buried, he descended into hell; the third day he rose
from the dead
Does this mean that Christ endured further suffering after his
death on the cross? As we shall see below, an examination of the biblical
evidence indicates that he did nOt: But before looking at the relevant biblical
texts
it is appropriate t0 examine the phrase "he descended into hell" in the
Apostles
Creed_
(1) The Origin of the Phrase; "He Descended Into Hell" :
murky
background lies behind much of the
of the phrase itself: Its origins,
where
can be found, are far from praiseworthy: The great church
historian Philip Schaff has summarized the development of the Apostles'
Creed in an extensive chart; which is reproduced on the
following pages:
This chart shows that, unlike the Nicene Creed and the Chalcedonian
Definition, the Apostles' Creed was not written 0r approved by
single
church council at one specific time. Rather;

in any of the early versions of the Creed (in the versions used in Rome; in the
rest of Italy, and in Africa) until it appeared in one of two versions from
Rufinus in AD. 390. Then it was not included again in any version of the
Creed until AD:
650. Moreover; Rufinus, the only person who included it
before A.D. 650, did not think that it meant that Christ descended into hell,
but understood the phrase simply to mean that Christ was "buried
In other
words
he took it t0 mean that Christ
descended into the grave:
(The Greek
form has hadzs, which can mean just
grave
not geenna; "hell, place of
punishment
We should also note that the phrase only appears in one of the
[WO versions of the Creed that we have from Rufinus: it was not in the Roman
form of the Creed that he preserved
This means, therefore; that until AD. 650 no version of the Creed included
this phrase with the intention of saying that Christ
descended into hell"_
the
only version t0 include the phrase before AD. 650 gives it
different
meaning: At this point one wonders if the term apostolic can in any sense be
applied to this phrase_
or if

claims for itself descent from the earliest apostles of Christ
This survey of the historical development of the phrase also raises the
possibility that when the phrase first began to be more commonly used, it may

expression

But latel
when the phrase was
incorporated into different versions of the Creed that already had the phrase

some other explanation had to be given t0 it: This mistaken
insertion of the phrase after the words
and buried"
apparently done by
someone around AD
650
led to all sorts of attempts t0 explain "he
descended into hell" in some way that did not contradict the rest of Scripture:

Some have taken it to mean that Christ suffered the pains of hell while on the
crOSS.
Calvin, for example, says that "Christ'$ descent into hell" refers t0 the
fact that he not only died
bodily death but that "it was expedient at the same
time for him to undergo the severity of God'$ vengeance, to appease his wrath
and satisfy his just judgment "2
Similarly, the
Heidelberg Catechism, Question 44,
asks
Why is it added: He descended into Hades?
Answer: That in my greatest temptations
may be assured that Christ;
my Lord, by his inexpressible anguish; pains, and terrors which he
suffered in his soul on the cross and before_
has redeemed me from the
anguish and torment of hell.
But is this
satisfactory explanation of the phrase
"he descended into hell"
While it is true that Christ suffered the outpouring of God $ wrath on the
cross, this explanation does not really fit the phrase in the Apostles' Creed
"descended" hardly represents this idea, and the placement of the phrase
after
was crucified, dead, and buried" makes this an artificial and
unconvincing interpretation.
Others have understood it t0 mean that Christ continued in the
state of death"
until his resurrection. The Westminster Larger Catechism; Question 50, says_
Christ'$ humiliation after his death consisted in his being buried, and
continuing in the state of the dead
and under the power of death till
the third day; which hath been otherwise expressed in these words_
descended into hell.
Though it is true that Christ continued in the state of death until the third day,
once again it is
strained and unpersuasive explanation of "he descended into
hell,
for the placement of the phrase would then give the awkward sense, "he
was crucified
dead, and buried; he descended [0 being dead
This
interpretation does not explain what the words first meant in this sequence but
is rather an unconvincing attempt t0 salvage some theologically acceprable
sense out of them
Moreover; the English word "hell" has no such sense as simply "being dead"
(though the Greek word hades can mean this), so this becomes
doubly
artificial explanation for English-speaking people:
Finally; some have
argued that the phrase means just what
appears
mean
on first
reading: that Christ actually did descend into hell after his death on
the cross_
It is easy to understand the Apostles' Creed tO mean just this
(indeed, that is certainly the natural sense), but then another question arises:
Can this idea be supported from Scripture?
(2) Possible Biblical Support for
Descent Into Hell: Support for the idea
that Christ descended into hell has been found primarily in five passages:
Acts 2.27; Romans 10.6-7; Ephesians 4.8-9;
Peter 3.18-20; and
Peter
4.6. (A few other passages have been appealed tO, but less convincingly )
On closer inspection, do any of those passages clearly establish this teaching?
(a) Acts 2.27. This is
of Peter
sermon on the Day of Pentecost; where
he is quoting Psalm 16.10. In the
James Version the verse reads:
"because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine
Holy One t0 see corruption.
Does this mean that Christ entered hell after he died? Not necessarily; because
another sense is
certainly possible for these verses_
The word "hell" here
represents
New Testament Greek term (hades) and an Old Testament
Hebrew term (she '6l, popularly translated as sheol) that can mean simply "the
grave
death" (the state of
dead)
Thus, the NIV translates:
"Because You will not abandon me [0 the grave_
will you let your Holy
One see decay'
(Acts 2.27). This sense
preferable because the context
emphasizes that Christ' s body rose from the grave
unlike David' $, which
remained
the grave: The reasoning is: "My body also will live in
26), "because YOu will not abandon me to the grave" (v 27). Peter is using
David =
psalm t0 show that Christ' s body did not decay
he is therefore
unlike David_
who "died and was buried_
and his tomb is here t0 this day"
29 NIV) Therefore this passage about Christ =
resurrection from the grave
does not convincingly support the idea that Christ descended into hell
Romans 10.6-7. These verses contain tWo rhetorical questions
again Old
Testament quotations (from Deut: 30.13): "Do not say in your heart;
Who
will ascend into heaven?
(that is
Lo bring Christ down) or
Who will descend
into the
abyss?' (that is_
to bring Christ up from the dead)
But this passage
hardly teaches that Christ descended into hell. The point of the passage is that
Paul is
people not to ask these questions, because Christ is not far
away
he is near
and faith in him is as near as
confessing with OUr mouth
and
believing in our heart (v 9).
These prohibited questions are questions of
unbelief,
not assertions of what Scripture teaches_
However; some may object
that Paul would not have anticipated that his readers would ask such questions
part
King
being
hope
telling
unless it was widely known that Christ did in fact descend "into the abyss_
However; even if this were true, Scripture would not be saying or implying
that Christ went into "hell" (in the sense of
place of punishment for the
dead, ordinarily expressed by Gk geenna); but rather that he went into "the
abyss
(Gk abyssos_
term which often in the LXX is used of the depths of
the ocean [Gen: 1.2; 7:11; 8.2; Deut: 8.7; Ps. 106(107).26], but it can also
apparently refer just to the realm of the dead [Ps. 70(71).20]).
Paul here uses the word "deep'
(abyssos) as
contrast to "heaven" in order t0
give the sense of
place that is unreachable, inaccessible to human beings:
The contrast is not; "Who shall go to find Christ in a place of great blessing
(heaven) or
place of great punishment (hell)?" but rather;
Who shall go to
find Christ in
place that is inaccessibly high (heaven) 0r in
place that
inaccessibly low (the
O1 the realm of death)?" No clear affirmation or
denial of
descent into hell" can be found in this passage.
Ephesians 4.8-9
Here Paul writes, "In saying; 'He ascended,
what does
mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Does this mean that Christ "descended" to hell? It is at first unclear what is
meant by "the lower parts of the earth;
but another translation seems
give
the best sense: "What does
he ascended' mean except that he also descended
t0 the lower; earthly
regions?
(NIV) Here the NIV takes "descended" to
refer to Christ'$ coming to earth as
baby (the Incaration). The last four
words are an
acceptable understanding of the Greek text;
the phrase
"the lower regions of the earth" to mean "lower regions which are the earth"
(the grammatical form in Greek would then be called
genitive of
apposition). We do the same thing
English
example, in the phrase "the
city of Chicago_
we mean "the city which is Chicago_
'The
rendering is preferable in this context because Paul is saying that the
Christ who went up to heaven (in his ascension) is the same one who earlier
came down from heaven (v 10). That
descent" from heaven occurred, of
course, when Christ came t0 be born as
man. So the verse speaks of the
incarnation_
nOr of
descent into hell:
3.18-20. For many people this is the most puzzling passage on
this entire subject
Peter tells us that Christ was

Does this refer t0
Christ
preaching in hell?
Some have taken "he went and preached t0 the spirits
prison"
t0 mean that
Christ went into hell and preached to the spirits who were there
either
proclaiming the gospel and
second chance t0 repent; Or just
proclaiming that he had triumphed ovel
them and that they were eternally
condemned
But these interprerations fail to explain adequately either the passage itself or
its setting in this context. Peter does not say that Christ preached to spirits
generally; but only to those
who
formerly did not

building of the ark
Such
limited audience

and preach t0. If Christ proclaimed his triumph; why only to these sinners and
not [0 all? And if he offered

sinners and nOt t0 all? Even more difficult for this view is the fact thar
Scripture elsewhere indicates that there is no opportunity for repentance after
death (Luke 16.26; Heb. 10.26-27).
Moreover; the context of
Peter
makes
preaching in hell" unlikely Peter is
encouraging his readers t0 witness boldly to hostile unbelievers around them:
He just told them to "always be prepared tO give an answer to everyone who
asks you" (1 Peter 3.15 NIV) This evangelistic motif would lose its urgency
were [eaching

And
would
not fit at all with
"preaching

Does it refer to Christ preaching to fallen
angels?
To give
better explanation for these difficulties, several commentators have
proposed
spirits in prison'
to mean demonic spirits, the spirits of
fallen angels
and have said that Christ proclaimed condemnation t0 these
demons_
This (it is claimed) would comfort Peter'$ readers by showing them
that the demonic forces oppressing them would also be defeated by Christ:
However; Peter'$ readers would have t0 g0 through an incredibly complicated
reasoning process
draw this conclusion when Peter does not explicitly
teach it; Thev would have t0 reason from

and conclude all this (points
2-5) from the simple statement that Christ

farfetched to say that Peter knew his readers would read all this into the text?
Moreover; Peter emphasizes hostile persons
not demons
in the context ( 1
Peter 3.14, 16).
And where would Peter'
readers get the idea that angels
sinned
the building of the ark"
There is
of that in the
Genesis
about the
building of the ark
And (in spite of what some have
claimed), if we look at all the traditions of Jewish interpretation of the flood
story; we find no mention of
angels
specifically
the
building
of the ark:
Therefore the view that Peter
speaking of Christ'$
proclamation of judgment to fallen angels is really not persuasive either:
Does it refer to Christ'$
proclaiming release to Old Testament saints?
Another explanation is that Christ; after his death; went and proclaimed
release t0 Old Testament believers who had been unable t0 enter heaven until
the completion of Christ $ redemptive work
But
we may question whether this view adequately accounts for what
the text actually says_
Ic does not say that Christ preached t0 those who were
believers or faithful to God
but t0 those
who formerly did not obey
-the
emphasis is on their disobedience. Moreover; Peter does not specify Old
Testament believers generally; but only those who were disobedient "in the
of Noah;
the building of the ark"
Peter 3.20)
Finally; Scripture gives uS no clear evidence tO make us think that full access
[0 the
in God'$ presence in heaven were withheld from Old
Testament believers when
died-
-indeed
several passages suggest that
believers who died before Christ's death did enter into the presence of God at
once because their sins were forgiven by trusting in the Messiah who was t0
come (Gen: 5.24;
Sam. 12.23; Pss. 16.11; 17:15; 23.6; Eccl
12.7
Matt.
22.31-32; Luke 16.22; Rom: 41-8; Heb. 11.5).
4 more
satisfying explanation.
The most satisfactory explanation of
Peter 3.19-20 seems rather t0 be one
proposed (but not really defended)
ag0 by Augustine: the passage refers
not [0
something Christ did between his death and resurrection; but tO what he
did "in the spiritual realm of existence
(or "through the Spirit"
at the time of
Noah:
When Noah was

This view gains support from Lwo ther statements of Peter: In
Peter 1.11,
he says that the "Spirit of Christ" was
speaking in the Old Testament
prophets. This suggests that Peter could readily have thought that the
Spirit

speaking through Noah as well. Then in
Peter 2.5_
he calls
Noah
preacher of righteousness'
(NIV);
the noun (keryx) that comes
from the same root as the verb "preached"
(ekeryxen) in
Peter 3.19. So it
seems likely that when Christ
preached t0 the spirits in prison'
he did s0
through Noah in the
before the flood:
The people
whom Christ preached through Noah were unbelievers on the
earth at the time of Noah, but Peter calls them

So "Christ preached t0 the spirits in

This interpretation is very appropriate to the larger context of

puzzling passage. Yet this means that our fourth possible support for
descent of Christ into hell also turns up negative
the text speaks rather of
something Christ did on earth at the time of Noah:
(e) 1 Peter 4:6. This fifth and final passage says
For this is why the gospel
was preached even t0 the dead, that though judged in the flesh like men; they
might live in the spirit like God.
Does this verse mean that Christ went to hell and preached the gospel to those
who had died? If so, it would be the only passage in the Bible that taught
second chance
for salvation after death and would contradict passages such
as Luke 16.19-31 and Hebrews 9.27
which clearly seem t0
this
possibility Moreover; the passage does not explicitly say that Christ preached
people after they had died, and could rather mean that the gospel
generab
was
preached (this verse does nOt even say that Christ preached) to people
who are nOw dead_
but that it was preached to them while

on earth:
This is
common explanation, and
seems [0 fit this verse much better: It
finds support in the second word of the verse, "this,
which refers back t0 the
final judgment mentioned at the end of verse
Peter is saying that it was
because of the final judgment that the gospeL
was
preached t0 the dead.
This
comfort the readers concerning their Christian friends who had
already died: They may have wondered, "Did the gospel benefit them, since it
didn
save them from death?" Peter answers that the reason the gospeL
was
preached t0 those who had died was not
save them from physical death
(they were
"judged in the flesh like men'
but
save them from final
judgmenc (they
"live in the spirit like God" ) Therefore, the fact that they
had died did not indicate that the gospeL
had failed in its purpose
would surely live forever in the spiritual realm
Thus
"the dead" are people who have died and are now dead
even
though
they were alive and on earth when the gospeL
was
preached t0 them: (The
NIV translates; "For this is the reason the gospel was preached even [0 those

and NASB has "those who are dead:

At this point; people on all sides of the question of whether Christ actually
descended into hell should be able to agree at least that the idea of Christ $
descent into hell" is not taught clearly or explicitly in any passage of
Scripture _
And many people (including the present author) will conclude that
this idea is not taught in Scripture at all_
But beyond the question of whether
any passage positively teaches this idea,
must ask whether
is contrary t0
any passages of Scripture_
Biblical Opposition to
"Descent Into Hell" =
In addition t0 the fact that
there is little if any biblical support for
descent of Christ into hell_
there are
some New Testament texts that argue against the possibility of Christ' $ going
hell after his death:
Jesus
words t0 the thief on the cross
Today you will be with me in
Paradise"
(Luke 23.43), imply that after Jesus died his soul (or spirit) went
immediately to the presence of the Father in heaven_
even though his body
remained on earth and was buried Some people deny this by arguing that
"Paradise'
place distinct from heaven_
but in both of the other New
Testament uses the word clearly means "heaven'
in 2 Corinthians 12.4 it is
the place
which Paul was caught up in his revelation of heaven, and in
Revelation 2.7 it is the place where
find the tree of life
which is clearly
heaven in Revelation 22.2 and 14.
In addition, the cry of Jesus, "It is finished" (John 19.30) strongly suggests
that Christ' $
suffering was finished at that moment and s0 was his alienation
from the Father because of
bearing
sin. This implies that he would not
descend into hell, but would go at once into the Father"
presence_
Finally, the cry; "Father; into your hands
commit my spirit" (Luke 23.46),
also suggests that Christ expected (correctly) the immediate end of his
suffering and estrangement and the
lcoming of his spirit into heaven by
God the Father (note Stephen s similar cry in Acts 7.59).
These texts indicate_
then
that Christ in his death experienced the same things
believers
this present age experience when they die
his dead body
remained on earth and was buried (as ours will be); but his spirit (or soul)
passed immediately into the presence of God in heaven (just as OurS will)_
Then on the first
Easter morning, Christ's spirit was reunited with his body
and he was raised from the dead
as Christians who have died will (when
Christ returns) be reunited tO their bodies and raised in their perfect
resurrection bodies t0 new life.
Jjust
This fact has pastoral encouragement for uS:
need not fear death; not only
because eternal life lies on the other side; but also because
know thar our
Savior himself has gone through exactly the same experience we will go
through
he has prepared,
even
sanctified the way; and we follow him with
confidence each step of that way: This is much greatel
comfort regarding
death than could ever be given by any view of
descent into hell:
(4) Conclusion Regarding the Apostles' Creed and the Question of
Christ'$ Possible Descent Into Hell: Does the phrase "he descended into
hell" deserve to be retained in the Apostles' Creed alongside the great
doctrines of the faith on which all can
agree? The single argument in its favor
seems t0 be the fact that it has been around s0
But an old mistake is still
mistake
and as
as it has been around there has been confusion and
disagreement over its meaning
On the other side
there are several
compelling
reasons
against
the
phrase. It has no clear warrant from Scripture and indeed seems to be
contradicted by some passages in Scripture: It has no claim to being
apostolic" and no support (in the sense of
descent into hell" E
from the first
six centuries of the church:
was not
the earliest versions of the Creed and
Wds
only included in
ater
because of an
apparent misunderstanding about
its meaning-
Unlike every other phrase in the Creed, it represents not some
major doctrine on which all Christians agree, but rather
statement about
which most Christians seem
disagree_
It is at best
confusing and in most
cases misba
for modern Christians. My own judgment is that there would
be all gain and no loss if it were dropped from the Creed once for all.
Concerning the doctrinal question of whether Christ did descend into hell
after he died, the answer from several passages of Scripture seems clearly t0
be no:
Wnhe ueni
Kennement
One of the differences berween Reformed
theologians and other Catholic and
Protestant theologians has been the question of the extent of the atonement
The question may be put this way: when Christ died on the cross, did he pay
for the sins of the entire human race 0r only for the sins of those who he knew
would ultimately be saved?
Non-Reformed people argue that the gospel offer in Scripture is repeatedly
made to all people, and for this offer to be genuine, the payment for sins must
have already been made and must be actually available for all people. They
long
long
keeping
leading-
also say that if the people whose sins Christ paid for are limited, then the free
offer of the gospel also is limited, and the offer of the gospel cannot be made
to all mankind without exception:
On the other hand, Reformed people argue that if Christ'$ death actually paid
for the sins of every person who ever lived, then there is no penalty left for
anyone [0 pay; and
necessarily follows that all people will be saved_
without
exception
For God could not condemn tO eternal punishment anyone whose
sins are already paid for: that would be demanding double payment and
would therefore be unjust: In answer t0 the objection that this compromises
the free offer of the gospel to every person, Reformed people answer that we
do not know who they are who will come t0 trust in Christ, for only God
knows that:
As far as
are concered, the free offer of the gospel is to be
made t0 everybody without exception:
We also know that everyone who
repents and believes in Christ will be saved, s0 all are called to repentance (cf:
Acts 17.30). The fact that God foreknew who would be saved, and that he
accepted Christ'$ death as payment for their sins only; does not inhibit the free
offer of the gospel, for who will respond to it is hidden in the secret counsels
of God
That we do not know who will respond no more constitutes
reason
for not offering the gospel to all than not knowing the extent of the harvest
prevents the farmer from sowing seed in his fields_
Finally,
Reformed people argue that God's purposes in redemption are agreed
upon within the Trinity and they are certainly accomplished. Those whom
God planned to save are the same people for whom Christ also came to die,
and to those same people the Holy Spirit will certainly apply the benefits of
Christ'$ redemptive work, even awakening their faith (John 1:12; Phil. 1.29;
cf: Eph: 2.2) and calling them tO trust in him
What God the Father purposed_
God the Son and the Holy Spirit agreed to and surely carried out:
Scripture Passages Used to Support the Reformed View. Several
Scripture passages speak of the fact that Christ died for his people. "The good
shepherd lays down his life for the
(John 10.11).
lay down my life
for the sheep" (John 10.15).
Paul
of "the church of God which he
obtained with the blood of his own Son" (Acts 20.28). He also says; "He who
did not spare his Own Son but gave him up for 4S all, will he not also give 4S
with him?" (Rom: 8.32).
This passage indicates
connection
between God $ purpose
giving up his Son "for Us all" and giving us "all
things'
that pertain
salvation as well_
In the next sentence Paul clearly
limits the application of this to those who will be saved because he says
"Who shall
any
against God's elect?" (Rom: 8.33) and in the
next verse mentions Christ'$ death as
reason why no one shall bring
sheep
speaks
things
bring
charge
against the elect (8.34). In another passage, Paul says
Husbands
love
your wives, as Christ loved the church and
himself up for her
(Eph
5.25).
Moreover; Christ
his earthly ministry is aware of -
group of people
whom the Father has given to him:
All that the Father gives me will come to
me; and him who comes t0 me
will not cast out
this is the will of him
who sent me
that
should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it
up at the last day" (John 6.37-39). He also says,
am not praying fOr the
world but for those whom YOu have given me_
for they are yours'
(John 17.9).
He then goes on from this specific reference t0 the disciples t0 say;
do not
pray for these only; but also for those who believe in me through their Word"
(John 17.20).
Finally, some passages speak of
definite transaction between the Father and
the Son when Christ died,
transaction that had specific reference t0 those
who would believe: For example; Paul says, "God shows his love for US in
that while we were yet sinners Christ died for uS
(Rom: 5.8). He adds,
For
if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his
much more
now thar
are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life" (Rom:
5.10). This reconciliation to God occured with respect t0 the specific people
who would be saved, and
occurred "while
we were enemies
Similarly,
Paul says_
"For our Sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, SO that in
him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor: 5.21; cf: Gal
1.:4;
Eph: 1:7). And "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; having become
curse for uS
(Gal. 3.13).
Further support for the Reformed view is found in the consideration that all
the blessings of salvation, including faith, repentance; and all of the works of
the Holy Spirit in applying redemption, were also secured by Christ'$
redemptive work specifically for his people
Those fOr whom he earned
forgiveness also have had those other benefits earned for them (cf: Eph: 1.3_
4; 2.8; Phil. 1.29).
What
have called "the Reformed view" in this section is commonly referred
[0 as "limited atonement:
However; most
theologians who hold this
position today do not prefer the term "limited atonement" because it is SO
easily subject to misunderstanding
as if this
somehow held that Christ' $
atoning work was deficient in some way. The term that is usually preferred is
particular redemption, since this view holds that Christ died for particular
people (specifically; those who would be saved and whom he came
charge
gave
during '
Son;
View
redeem), that he foreknew each one of them individually (cf: Eph: 1.3-5) and
had them individually
mind in his atoning work
The opposite position_
that Christ $ death actually paid for the sins of all
people who ever lived, is called "general redemption'
or "unlimited
atonement:
2. Scripture Passages Used to Support the Non-Reformed View (General
Redemption
Unlimited Atonement):
number of Scripture passages
indicate that
some sense Christ died for the whole world_
John the Baptist
said, "Behold, the Lamb of God
who takes away the sin of the worldl " (John
1.29).
And John 3.16 tells us that "God so loved the world that he gave his
only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal
life.
Jesus said, " The bread which
shall give for the life of the world is my
flesh" (John 6.51)_
Paul says that in Christ "God was
reconciling
the world to
himself" (2 Cor: 5.19). We read of Christ that "he is the expiation [lit.
propitiation
for 0ur sins
and not for OurS only but also for the sins of the
whole world"
John 2.2). Paul writes that Christ Jesus
gave himself as
ransom for all" (1 Tim. 2.6). And the author of Hebrews says that Jesus was
for
little while made
ower than the angels
'so that by the grace of God he
might taste death for every one
(Heb: 2.9).
Other passages appear
speak of Christ dying for those who
nor be
saved_
Paul says, "Do not let what YOu eat cause the ruin of one for whom
Christ died" (Rom: 14.15). In
similar context he tells the Corinthians not [0
eat publicly at an idol'$ temple because they might encourage those who are
weak in their faith t0 violate their consciences and eat food offered
Idols_
He then says,
And s0 by your knowledge this weak man
destroyed, the
brother for whom Christ died'
(1 Cor: &11) . Peter writes about false teachers
as follows: "But false prophets also arose among the people; just as there will
be false teachers among yOu; who will secretly bring in destructive heresies
even
denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift
destruction"
(2 Peter 2.1; cf. Heb. 10.29).
3. Some Points of Agreement and Some Conclusions About Disputed
Texts_
It would be helpful first to list the points on which both sides agree:
1. Not all will be saved:
2. A free offer of the gospel
rightly be made t0 every person ever born.
completely tnue that "whoever will" may come to Christ for salvation
and
no one who comes to him will be turned away. This free offer of the gospel is
will
extended in
faith to every person:
All agree that Christ'$ death in itself; because he is the infinite Son of God,
has infinite merit and is in itself sufficient t0 pay the penalty of the sins of as
many O1 as few aS the Father and the Son decreed. The question is not about
the intrinsic merits of Christ'$ sufferings and death; but about the number of
people for whom the Father and the Son thought Christ's death to be
sufficient payment at the time Christ died:
Beyond these points of agreement; however;
difference remains concerning
the
following question: "When Christ died, did he actually pay the penalty
only for the sins of those who would believe in him, or for the sins of every
person who ever lived?" On this question
seems that those who hold t0
particular redemption have stronger arguments 0n their side.
First, an
important point that is not generally answered by advocates of the general
redemption view is that people who are eternally condemned to hell suffer the
penalty for all of their own sins_
and therefore their penalty could not have
been fully taken by Christ Those who hold the general redemption view
sometimes answer that people suffer in hell because of the sin of rejecting
Christ; even though their other sins
paid for: But this is hardly
satisfactory position_
for (1) some have never rejected Christ because they
have never heard of him; and (2) the emphasis of Scripture when
eternal punishment is nOt on the fact that the people suffer because they have
rejected Christ; but on the fact that they suffer because of their own sins
this life (see Rom. 5.6-8, 13-16,et al.). This significant point seems to tip the
argument decisively in favor of the particular redemption position
Another
significant point in favor of particular redemption is the fact that
Christ completely earned our salvation; paying the penalty for all our sins. He
did not just redeem us potentially; but actually redeemed us as individuals
whom he loved_
third weighty point in favor 0f particular redemption is that
there is eterna
unity in the counsels and plans of God and in the work of the
Father; Son, and Holy Spirit in accomplishing their plans (see Rom. 8.28-30).
with
t0 Scripture passages used
support general redemption, the
following may be said: Several passages that speak about "the world" simply
mean that sinners generally will be saved, without implying that every single
individual in the world will be saved. So the fact that Christ is the Lamb of
God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1.29) does not mean (on
anybody'$ interpretation) that Christ actually removes the sins of every single
person in the world, for both sides agree that not all are saved. Similarly; the
fact that God was in Christ
reconciling the world
himself (2 Cor: 5.19) does
good
Were
speaks
regard
not mean that every
single person in the world was reconciled t0 God, but that
sinners generally were reconciled to God_
Another way of putting these two
passages would be t0 say that Jesus was the Lamb of God who takes away the
sin of sinners_
or that God was in Christ
reconciling sinners to himself This
does not mean that all sinners will be saved or were reconciled_
but simply
that these groups in general, but not necessarily
single person in them;
were the objects of God $
redeeming `
WOrk:
essentially means that "God s0
loved sinners that he gave his only Son
without implying that every
sinner in the whole world will be saved_
The passages that speak about Christ dying "for" the whole world are best
understood t0 refer [0 the free offer of the
gospel that is made t0 all people
When Jesus says_
The bread which
shall give for the life of the world is my
flesh" (John 6.51), it is in the context of speaking of himself as the Bread that
came down from heaven; which is offered to people and which they may; if
they are
willing
receive for themselves_
Earlier in the same discussion Jesus
said that "the bread of God
that which comes down from heaven, and gives
life to the world" (John 6.33). This may be understood in the sense of
bringing redeeming life into the world but not
that every single
person in the world
have that redeeming life_
Jesus then speaks of himself
as inviting others t0 come and take up this
living bread: "He who comes to me
shall nor
hunger; and he who believes in me shall never thirst:
This is the
bread which comes down from heaven, thar
man may eat of it and nOL die.
am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this
bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which
shall give for the life of the

life into

eternal life to the world (a point on which both sides agree) is nOt to say that

that iS
separate question:
When John says that Christ "is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ourS
only but also for the sins of the whole world"
John 2.2, author'$
translation), he may simply be understood t0 mean that Christ is the atoning
sacrifice that the gospel
now makes available for the sins of everyone in the
world:
The preposition "for" (Gk
plus genitive)
ambiguous with
respect t0 the
specific sense in which Christ is the propitiation "for" the sins
of the world. Peri simply means
concerning'
or "with respect to
but is not
specific enough to define the exact way in which Christ is the sacrifice with
respect t0 the sins of the world_
would be entirely consistent with the
language of the verse t0 think that John is simply saying that Christ is the
sacrifice who is available t0 pay for the sins of anyone in the world:
every
meaning

atoning:
Likewise
when Paul says that Christ
gave himself as
ransom for all" (1
Tim: 2.6) ,
we are t0 understand this t0 mean
ransom available for all people,
without exception:
When the author of Hebrews says that Christ was made lower than the angels
so that by the grace of God he might taste death for
one'
(Heb: 2.9),
the passage is best understood tO refer to every one of Christ's people, every
one who
redeemed. It does not say everyone "in the whole world" or any
such expression, and in the immediate context the author is certainly speaking
of those who are redeemed (see
~bringing many sons to glory" [v: 10]; "those
who are sanctified" [v 1l]; and "the children God has given me
[v: 13]) The
Greek word pas; here translated
one,
is also used in
similar sense [0
mean "all of God's people'
in Hebrews 8.11, "for all shall know me_
and in
Hebrews 12.8, "If you are left without discipline; in which all have
participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
In both cases
the "all" is not explicitly restricted by
specific phrase such as "all of God's
people;
buc this is clearly the sense in the overall context: Of course, in other
contexts, the same word "all" can mean
all people without exception;
but
this must be determined from the individual context
each case.
When Paul speaks in Romans 14.15 and
Corinthians &.11 about the
possibility of destroying one for whom Christ died, it seems best here as well
to think of the word "for
the sense that Christ died
to make salvation
available for
these people 0r
bring the free offer of the gospel
these
people who are associated with the fellowship of the church: He does not
seem t0 have in mind the specific question of the inter-trinitarian decision
regarding whose sins the Father counted Christ'$ death as
payment fOr:
Rather; he is speaking of those to whom the gospel has been offered. In
another passage, when Paul calls the weak man
"brother for whom Christ
died"
Corinthians &.11_
he is nOt necessarily pronouncing on the inward
spiritual condition of
person's heart, but is probably just speaking according
tO what is often called the "judgment of charity" by which people who are
participating in the fellowship of the church can rightly be referred to as
brothers and sisters.
When Peter speaks of false teachers who
in destructive heresies_
even
denying the Master who bought them'
(2 Peter
it is unclear whether the
word "Master " (Gk despotos) refers t0 Christ (as in Jude 4) 0r to God the
Father (as in Luke 2.29; Acts 4.24; Rev: 6.10). In either case
the Old
Testament allusion is probably to Deuteronomy 32.6
where Moses says t0 the
rebellious people who have turned away from God; "Is not he your Father
every
every
FO
bring
21)
who has boughtyou?
(author
translation):
Peter is drawing an analogy
between the past false prophets who arose among the Jews and those who will
be false teachers within the churches [0 which he writes:
But false prophets
also arose among the people; just as there will be false teachers among You,
who will secretly bring in destructive heresies
even
denying the
who
bought them" (2 Peter 2.1). In line with this clear reference to false prophets
in the Old Testament; Peter also alludes t0 the fact that the rebellious Jews
turned away from God who
"bought" them out of Egypt in the exodus.
From
the time of the exodus onward_
any Jewish person would have considered
himself or herself one who was "bought" by God in the exodus and therefore
person of God $ Own possession: In this sense, the false teachers
among the people were denying God their Father; t0 whom they rightfully
belonged_
So the text means not that Christ had redeemed these false
prophets, but simply that they were rebellious Jewish people (01 church
attenders in the same position as the rebellious Jews)
who were rightly owned
by God because they had been brought out of the land of Egypt (or their
forefathers had), but they were ungrateful to him: Christ's specific redemptive
work on the CrOss is nOt in view in this verse_
With regard t0 the verses that talk of Christ'$
dying for his sheep, his church;
his people
non-Reformed people may answer that these passages do not
that he died to pay the penalty for others as well. In response, while it is
true that they do not explicitly
that Christ died for others as well, their
frequent reference to his death for his people would at least strongly suggest
that this is
correct inference.
Even if they do not absolutely imply such
particularizing of redemption, these verses do at least seem to be most
naturally interpreted in this way:
In conclusion;
seems
me that the Reformed position of "particular
redemption'
is most consistent with the overall
teaching of Scripture:
But
once that has been said_
several points of caution need
be raised:
Points
Clarification and Caution Regarding This Doctrine_
It is
important to state some points of clarification and also some areas in which
we can
rightly object to the way in which some advocates of particular
redemption have expressed their arguments. It is also important t0 ask what
the pastoral implications are for this teaching:
1. lt seems
mistake
state the question as Berkhof does
and focus
on the purpose of the Father and the Son, rather than on what actually
happened in the atonement: If we confine the discussion to the purpose of the
Master
arising
deny
deny
atonement; then this is just another form of the larger dispute between
Calvinists and Arminians over whether God'$ purpose is (a) t0 save all
people,
purpose that is frustrated by man'$ will to rebel
the Arminian
position
whether God's purpose is (b) tO save those whom he has chosen
the Calvinist
position: This question will not be decided at the narrow point
of the question of the extent
the atonement; for the specific scriptural texts
on that point are too few and can hardly be said t0 be conclusive on either
side:
One' $ decisions on these passages will tend to be determined by one"
view of the
question as t0 what Scripture as
whole teaches about the
nature of the atonement and about the broader issues of God's providence
sovereignty; and the doctrine of election. Whatever decisions are made on
those
larger topics will apply specifically t0 this point; and people will come
[O their conclusions accordingly:
Rather than
focusing on the purpose of the atonement; therefore, the question
rightfully asked about the atonement itself: Did Christ pay for the sins of all
unbelievers who will be eternally condemned, and did he pay for their sins
fully and completely on the cross?
seems that we have t0 answer no [0 that
question:
2. The statements
Christ died for his people only" and "Christ died for all
people" are both tnue in some senses_
and too often the argument over this
issue has been confused because of various senses that can be given tO the
word "for" in these tWO statements_
The statement
Christ died for his people only" can be understood to mean
that "Christ died to actually pay the penalty for all the sins of his people
only:
that sense it is true. But when non-Reformed people hear the
sentence "Christ died for his people only;'
they often hear in it, "Christ died
so that he could make the gospel available only t0
chosen few;
and
troubled over what they see as
real threat to the free offer of the gospel to
every person_
Reformed people who hold t0 particular redemption should
recognize the potential
for
misunderstanding that arises with the sentence
"Christ died for his people only;
and, out of concern for the truth and out of
pastoral concemn t0 affirm the free offer of the gospel and t0 avoid
misunderstanding
in the body of Christ;
should be more precise in saying
exactly what they mean. The simple sentence
"Christ died for his people
only;
[ue
the sense explained above
is seldom understood in thal
way when people unfamiliar with Reformed doctrine hear iL, and
therefore
is better not to use such an ambiguous sentence at all
On the other hand, the sentence, "Christ died for all people;
is true if it
larget =
they
they
while
means
Christ died to make salvation available to all people'
0r' if it means,
"Christ died to bring the free offer of the gospel to all people.
In fact; this is
the kind of language Scripture itself uses in passages
John 6.51;
Timothy 2.6; and
John 2.2.
It really seems to be only
nit-picking that
creates controversies and useless disputes when Reformed people insist on
being such purists in their speech that
object any time someone says that
"Christ died for all people_
There are certainly acceptable ways of
understanding that sentence that are consistent with the speech of the
scriptural
authors themselves.
Similarly;
do not think we should rush tO criticize an evangelist who tells an
audience of unbelievers, "Christ died for your sins
if it is made clear in the
context that it is necessary t0 trust in Christ before one can receive the
benefits of the gospel offer: In that sense the sentence
simply understood to
mean "Christ died t0 offer YOu
forgiveness for your sins" or "Christ died tO
make available forgiveness for your sins_
The important point here is that
sinners realize that salvation
available for everyone and that payment of
sins is available for everyone.
At this point some Reformed theologians will object and will warn 4S that if
we say t0 unbelievers
"Christ died for your sins,
the unbelievers will draw
the conclusion, " Therefore
am saved no matter what
But this does not
seem [0
problem
actual fact; for whenevel
evangelicals (Reformed or
non-Reformed)
about the gospel
unbelievers, they are always
clear on the fact that the death of Christ has no benefit for
person unless that
person believes in Christ: Therefore
the
problem seems to be more something
that Reformed people think unbelievers should believe (if they were
consistent in reasoning back into the secret counsels of God and the
relationship between the Father and Son in the counsels of the Trinity at the
point of Christ' =
propitiatory sacrifice on the cross)
But unbelievers simply
do not reason that way: they know that they must exercise taith
Christ
before
will experience any benefits from his saving work Moreover; it is
far more likely that people will understand the sentence "Christ died for your
sins" in the doctrinally correct sense that "Christ died in order
offer you
forgiveness for your sins" rather than in the doctrinally incorrect sense,
"Christ died and completely paid the penalty already for all your sins.
3. In terms of the practical, pastoral effects of Our words, both those who hold
particular redemption and those who hold to general redemption agree at
several key points:
likc
they
speak
very
they
Both sincerely want t0 avoid
implying that people will be saved whether

Reformed people of saying that the elect will be saved irrespective of
responding

misrepresentation of the
Reformed position.
Un the other hand_
Reformed people think that those who
hold to generaba
redemption are in danger of implying that everybody will be
saved whether

should hold that position if they were consistent with their other views:
b. Both sides want [0 avoid
implying that there might be some people who
come t0 Christ for salvation but are turned away because Christ did not die
for them. No one wants tO say 0r imply to an unbeliever; "Christ might have
died for your sins (and then again he might not havel)
Both sides want [0
clearly affirm that all who come t0 Christ for salvation will
tact be saved:
"Him who comes t0 me
will not cast out" (John 6.37)_
Both sides want [O avoid
implying that God is hypocritical or insincere
when he makes the free offer of the gospel. It is _
genuine offer; and it is
always true that all who wish
come
Christ for salvation and who do
actually come to him will be saved_
Finally;
may ask why this matter is S0 important after all. Although
Reformed people have sometimes made belief in particular redemption
test
of doctrinal orthodoxy; it would be healthy tO realize that Scripture itself
never
singles this out as
doctrine of major importance, nor does
once
make it the subject of any explicit theological discussion
Our knowledge of
the issue comes only from incidental references tO it in passages whose
concern is with other doctrinal 0r practical matters_
In fact; this is really
question that probes into the inner counsels of the Trinity and does S0 in an
area in which there is very little direct scriptural
testimony
fact that should
cause S [0 be cautious_
A balanced pastoral perspective would seem to be to
say that this
of particular redemption seems t0 US t0 be true; that it
gives logical consistency t0 OuI theological system, and that
can be helpful
in assuring people of Christ's love for them individually and of the
completeness of his redemptive work for them; but that it also is
subject that
almost inevitably leads [0 some
confusion, some
misunderstanding; and often
some wrongful argumentativeness and divisiveness among God's people
of which are negative pastoral considerations Perhaps that is why the apostles
such as John and Peter and Paul;
their wisdom, placed almost no emphasis
on this question at all. And perhaps we would do well to ponder their
they
teaching
example_
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL
APPLICATON
In what ways has this chapter enabled you to appreciate Christ'$ death
more than you did before? Has it given YOu more 0r less confidence in
the fact that your sins have actually been paid for by Christ?
If the ultimate cause of the atonement is found in the love and justice of
God, then was there
anything in YOu that required God to love YOu Or to
take steps to save YOu (when he looked forward and thought of you as
sinner in rebellion against him)? Does your answer t0 this question help
you [0
appreciate the character of God's love for YOu as
person who did
not at all deserve that love? How does that realization make you feel in
your relationship t0 God?
Do you think that Christ'$
were enough t0 pay for your sins?
Are you willing to rely on his work t0 pay for all your sins? Do you
think he is
sufficient Savior; worthy of yOur trust? When he invites
YOW,
Come 0 me
and
will give YOu rest" (Matt: 11:28) , do you
now trust him? Will yOu now and always rely on him with your whole
heart for complete salvation?
If Christ bore all the guilt for our sins, all the wrath of God against sin,
and all the penalty of the death that we deserved_
then
God ever turn
his wrath
you as
believer (see Rom: 8.31-39)? Can any of the
hardships 0r
sufferings that You experience in life be due to the wrath of
God against
If not; then why do we as Christians experience
difficulties and sufferings in this life (see Rom. 8.28; Heb. 12.3-11)?
Do you think Christ's life was good enough to deserve God's approval?
Are yOU
willing to rely on it for YOur eternal destiny? Is Jesus Christ a
reliable enough and good enough Savior for YOu tO trust him? Which
would YOu rather trust in for YOur eternal standing before God: your own
life or Christ' s?
If Christ has indeed redeemed you
bondage [0 sin and t0 the
kingdom of Satan; are there areas of your life in which you could more
fully realize this to be true? Could this realization give YOu more
encouragement
your Christian life?
Do You think it was fair for Christ tO be your substitute and t0 pay your
penalty? When You think about him acting as YOur substitute and dying
for YOu_
what attitude and emotion is called forth in your heart?

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
Romans %.23-26: Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God_
they are justified Dy his grace as
gift, through the redemption which is in
Christ Jesus
whom God put forward as an expiation [lit propitiation "
his blood, to be received by faith:
This was t0 show God $ righteousness,
because
nis divine forbearance ne had passed over former sins;
was
prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him
who has faith in Jesus:
HYMN
"when
Survey the Wondrous Cross'
When
survey the wondrous CrOSS
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest
count but loss;
And pour contempt on all my pride_
Forbid it, Lord_
thac
should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God:
All the vain
that charm me most,
sacrifice them to his blood_
from his head,
his hands, his
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did
er such love and SOrTow meet;
Or thorns compose s0 rich
crown?
gain _
things
See,
fecl,
His dying crimson; like
robe,
Spread
er his body on the tree;
Then am
dead to all the globe_
And all the globe is dead t0 me.
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were
present far t00 small;
Love S0 amazing; SO divine,
Demands my soul, my life_
my all.

Resurrection and Ascension
What was Christ $ resurrection body like? What is its significance
for us? What happened
Christ when he ascended into heaven?
What
meant by the states 0f Jesus Christ?
EXPLANATION
SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Resurrecion
New Testament Evidence. The Gospels contain abundant testimony
the
resurrection of Christ (see Matt: 28.1-20; Mark 16.1-8; Luke 24.1-53; John
20:1-21.25). In addition to these detailed narratives in the four gospels, the
book of Acts is
story of the apostles' proclamation of the resurrection of
Christ and of continued prayer to Christ and trust in him as the one who is
alive and reigning in heaven. The Epistles depend entirely on the assumption
that Jesus
living; reigning Savior who is nOw the exalted head of the
church; who is to be trusted, worshiped, and adored_
and who will some day
return in power and great glory tO reign as King over the earth. The book of
Revelation repeatedly shows the risen Christ reigning in heaven and predicts
his retum t0 conquer his enemies and reign in glory Thus the entire New
Testament bears witness t0 the resurrection of Christ
2. The Nature of Christ' $ Resurrection: Christ'$ resurrection was not
simply
coming back from the dead
as had been experienced by others
before_
such as Lazarus (John 1:1-44), for then Jesus would have been
subject t0 weakness and aging and eventually would have died again just as
all other human beings die_
Rather; when he rose from the dead Jesus was the
"first fruits'
Cor: 15.20, 23) of
new kind of human life;
life in which
his body was made perfect; no longer subject t0 weakness, aging_
death;
but able to live eternally
It is true that tWo of Jesus
disciples did not recognize him when they walked
with him on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24.13-32), but Luke specifically tells
us that this was because "their eyes were kept from recognizing him" (Luke
24:16), and later "their eyes were opened and they recognized him" (Luke
AND
24.31). Mary Magdalene failed to recognize Jesus only for
moment (John
20.14-16), but it may have been still quite dark and she was not at first
at him
she had come the first time
while
was still dark" (John
20.1), and she
'turned" to speak to Jesus once she
recognized him (John
20.16).
On other occasions the disciples seemed to have recognized Jesus fairly
quickly (Matt: 28.9, 17; John 20.19-20,
26-28; 21.7, 12). When Jesus
appeared to the eleven disciples in Jerusalem; they were initially startled and
frightened (Luke 24.33,37), yet when they saw Jesus' hands and his feet and
watched him eat
piece of fish;
were convinced that he had risen from
the dead_
These examples indicate that there was
considerable
degree of
continuity between the physical appearance of Jesus before his death and after
his resurrection. Yet Jesus did not look exactly as he had before he died, for in
addition to the initial amazement of the disciples at what they apparently
thought could not happen
there was probably sufficient
difference in his
physical appearance for Jesus not t0 be immediately recognized _
Perhaps that
difference in appearance was simply the difference between
man who had
lived
life of suffering, hardship, and
and one whose body was restored
its full youthful appearance of perfect health: though Jesus' body was still
physical body, it was raised as
transformed body; never able again to suffer;
be weak or ill, or die; it had
'put on immortality" ( 1 Cor: 15.53). Paul says the
resurrection body is raised "imperishable
in glory
in power
spiritual body" (1 Cor: 15.42-44)
The fact that Jesus had
physical
that could be touched and handled
after the resurrection is seen in that the disciples "took hold of his feet" (Matt.
28.9)_
that he appeared to the disciples on the road to Emmaus to be just
another traveler on the road (Luke 24.15-18, 28-29), that he took bread and
broke it (Luke 24.30), that he ate
piece of broiled fish to demonstrate clearly
that he had
physical body and was not just
spirit; that
thought him to
gardener (John 20.15), that "he showed them his hands and his side'
(John 20.20), that he invited Thomas t0 touch his hands and his side (John
20.27), that he prepared breakfast for his disciples (John 21:12-13), and that
he explicitly told them; "See my hands and my feet; that it is [ myself; handle
me, and see
spirit has not flesh and bones aS YOu see that
have
(Luke
24.39).
Peter said that the disciples
ate and drank with him after he rose from
the dead" (Acts 10.41).
It is true that Jesus apparently was able to appear and disappear out of sight
suddenly (Luke 24.31,36; John 20.19,26). Yet we should be careful not
draw too many conclusions from this fact, for not all the passages affirm
looking
they
griet,
body
Mary
quite
that Jesus could suddenly appear
disappear; some just say that Jesus came
and stood among the disciples. When Jesus suddenly vanished from the sight
of the disciples in Emmaus, this may have been
special miraculous
occurrence, such as happened when "the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip;
and the eunuch saw him nO more
(Acts 8.39). Nor should we make too much
of the fact that Jesus came and stood among the disciples 0n Lwo occasions
when the doors were
shut'
(John 20.19, 26), for no text says that Jesus
passed through walls
anything like that: Indeed, on another
occasion in
the New 'Testament where someone needed t0 pass through
locked door; the
door miraculously opened (see Acts 12.10).
Murray Harris has recently proposed an alternative interpretation [0 the verses
quoted above, especially the verses showing Jesus appearing and disappearing
at different times: he says that these verses show that while Jesus could
sometimes materialize into
physical body; his customary existence was in
nonphysical or nonfleshly form of his
spiritual body:
Moreover; when he
ascended into heaven after
Jesus permanently gave up any more
materializing into
physical body. Professor Harris says:
The resurrection of Jesus was not his transformation into an
immaterial body but his acquisition of
spiritual body" which could
materialize 0r dematerialize at will. When, on occasion, Jesus chose
appear
various persons in material form; this was just aS really
the
spiritual body" of Jesus as when he was not visible 0r
tangible.
After the
days, when his appearances on earth were
ended, Jesus assumed the sole mode of being visible to the inhabitants
of heaven but
nonfleshly body:
In his risen state he
transcended the normal laws of physical existence.
He was no
longer
bound by material 0r spatial limitations
It is important tO realize that Harris definitely affirms the physical, bodily
resurrection of Jesus from the dead:
He says that the same body that died was
also raised
but then it was transformed into
spiritual body'
with new
properties.
In response
while
do not consider this
doctrinal question of major
significance (since it is simply
question about the nature of the resurrection
body; about which we now know very little),
nevertheless think the
Testament provides some persuasive evidence that would lead uS t0 differ
with Harris $ view: Harris agrees that at several times Jesus had
physical
forty
days
forty
having
New
body that could eat food and be touched and that had flesh and bones. He
even agrees that at Jesus
ascension into heaven; "It was
real Jesus of *flesh
and bones' (Luke 24.39) who was taken up before the eyes of his disciples
The only question is whether this body of Jesus at other times existed in
nonphysical, nonfleshly form; as Harris claims
To answer that; we have t0
ask whether the New Testament texts about Jesus appearing and disappearing
require this conclusion. It does not seem that they do.
Luke 24.31, which says that after Jesus broke bread and gave it t0 the Lwo
disciples_
~he disappeared from their sight" (NIV); does not require this_
The
Greek expression used here for "disappeared" (aphantos egeneto)
not
occur
Isewhere in the New Testament; but when found in Diodorus Siculus
historian who wrote from 60-30 B.C.); it is used once of
Mal
named
Amphiaraus who
with his chariot; fell into
chasm and "disappeared from
sight;
and the same expression is used in another place t0 talk about Atlas
who was blown off
mountaintop by high winds and "disappeared_
neither case does the expression mean that the person became immaterial or
even invisible
but only that he was moved t0
place hidden from people' $
sight:
So in Luke 24.31
we can conclude is that the disciples no
longer
cave
Jesus
perhaps the Spirit of the Lord took him away (as with Philip in
Acts 8.39), 01 perhaps he was
ust hidden again from their sight (as with
Moses and Elijah on the Mount of
Transfiguration, Matt: 17.8,
O1 aS with the
heavenly army around Elisha
6.17,
[apparently] as with the
disciples
walking past the prison guards in Acts 5.19-23; 12.6, 10). In neither
case do we need
conclude that Jesus' physical
body became nonphysical,
any more than we need to conclude that the disciples
bodies became
nonphysical when
walked past the
(Acts 5.23; 12:10) and escaped
from prison. So Luke 24.31 does not say that any transformation happened to
Jesus' body; it merely says that the disciples could no longer see him:
As for the claim that Jesus passed through material substances_
this is not
substantiated in the New Testament As explained above; the fact that Jesus
appeared in
room when the doors had been shut or locked (John 20.19, 26)
may Or may not mean that he passed through
door or wall. Especially
relevant here is the first deliverance of the apostles from prison: they did not
walk through the doors_
but
an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and
brought them out"
(Acts 5.19); yet the next morning the prison officers
reported; "We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at
the doors
but when we opened
we found n0 one
inside" (Acts 5.23). The
angel had opened the doors, the apostles had passed through, and the angel
does
Kings
they
guards
had closed and locked the doors again. Similarly; when Peter was rescued
from prison, he did not dematerialize in order to pass through the locked
chains around him, but "the chains fell off his hands-
(Acts 12.7).
In the
same way; it is certainly possible that the door miraculously opened for Jesus
or even that he had entered the room
the disciples but was temporarily
hidden from their eyes.
with
[0 the nature of Jesus' resurrection body; much more decisive
than the texts about Jesus' appearing and
disappearing
the texts that show
that Jesus clearly had
physical body with "flesh and bones'
(Luke 24.39),
which could eat and drink; break bread_
prepare breakfast; and be touched
Unlike the texts on Jesus' appearing and disappearing
these texts are nOr
capable of an alternative explanation that denies Jesus' physical body
Harris
himself agrees that in these texts Jesus had
body of flesh and bones_
But
what were these physical appearances intended to teach the disciples if not
that Jesus' resurrection body was definitely
physical body? If Jesus rose
from the dead in the same
physical body that had died, and if he repeatedly
appeared to the disciples in that physical body; eating and
with them
(Acts 10.41) over forty days; and if he ascended into heaven in that same
physica
body (Acts 1.9), and if the angel
immediately told the disciples that
"this Jesus, who was taken up from YOu into heaven, will come in the same
way as YOu saw him g0 into heaven'
(Acts 1.11) , then Jesus was clearly
teaching them that his resurrection body was
physical body If the
customary form
of his resurection body was nonphysical; then in these
repeated physical appearances Jesus would be guilty of
misleading
the
disciples (and all subsequent readers of the New Testament) into thinking that
his resurrection body remained physical when
did not: If he was
customarily nonphysical and was going
become nonphysical forever at the
ascension, then
would be very
misleading for Jesus to say;
See my hands
and my feet; that it is
myself; handle me, and see; for
spirit has not flesh
and bones as YOu see that
have" (Luke 24.39). He did not say;
flesh and
bones, as YOu see that
temporarily have
It would have been wrong
teach
the disciples that he had
physical body when in his customary mode of
existence he really did nOt.
If Jesus had wanted t0 teach them that he could materialize and dematerialize
at will (as Harris argues), then he could easily have dematerialized before
their eyes, so that they could clearly record this event. Or he could easily have
passed through
wall while
watched_
rather than just suddenly
standing
among them: In short; if Jesus and the New Testament authors had wanted tO
teach us that the resurection body was customarily and essentially
nonmaterial;
could have done SO
but instead they gave many clear

body that was perfected, made forever free from weakness, sickness, and
death:
Finally; there
larger doctrinal consideration. The physical resurrection of
Jesus, and his eternal possession of
physical resurrection body; give clear
affirmation of the goodness of the material creation that God originally made:
And God saw everything that he had made_
and behold, it was very good
(Gen: 1.31). We as resurrected men and women will live forever in
new
heavens and
new earth in which righteousness dwells" (2 Peter 3.13). We
will live in .
renewed earth that
will be set free from its bondage t0 decay'
(Rom: 8.21) and become like
new Garden of Eden_
There will be
new
Jerusalem, and people "shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the
nations'
(Rev: 21:26), and there will be "the river of the water of life, bright
crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the
middle of the street of the city; also_
on either side of the river; the tree of life
with its twelve kinds of fruit; yielding its fruit each
(Rev: 22.1-2). In
this very material, physical, renewed universe_
seems that we will need [0
live as human
with physical
bodies; suitable for life in God $ renewed
physical creation_
pecifically, Jesus
physical resurrection body affirms the
goodness of God's original creation of man not as
mere spirit like the
angels
but as
creature with
physical body that was
very good.
We must
not fall into the error of thinking that nonmaterial

when God made us as the pinnacle of
his creation
he gave us physical bodies. In

Jesus

himself forever:
3. Both the Father and the Son Participated in the Resurrection: Some
texts affirm that God the Father specifically raised Christ from the dead (Acts
2.24; Rom. 6.4;
Cor: 6.14; Gal: 1:1; Eph: 1.20), but other texts speak of
Jesus a5
participating in his own resurrection. Jesus says:
The reason my
Father loves me is that
lay down my life
only to take it up
No one

lay it down of my Own accord

down and authority t0 take
up again: This command
received from my
Father" (John 10.17-18 NIV; cf: 2.19-21). It is best t0 conclude that both the
Father and the Son were involved in the resurrection.
Indeed, Jesus says,
am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25; cf. Heb: 7:16).

Christ'$ Resurrection Insures Our Regeneration: Peter says that "we
have been born anew t0
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3). Here he explicitly connects Jesus' resurrection
with our regeneration Or new birth:
When Jesus rose from the dead he had
new quality of life_
"resurrection life
human body and human spirit
that were perfectly suited for fellowship and obedience to God forever: In his
resurrection; Jesus eared for uS
new life just like his. We do not receive all
of that new
resurection life" when we become Christians_
for our bodies
remain as they were, still subject t0 weakness, aging; and death
But in our
spirits
we are made alive with new resurrection power:
Thus it is through his
resurection that Christ earned for uS the new kind of life we receive when we
are "born
This is why Paul can say that God "made us alive together
with Christ (by grace yOu have been saved), and raised uS Up with him " (Eph_
2.5-6; cf:
Col: 3.1)
When God raised Christ from the dead he thought of us
as somehow being raised "with Christ" and therefore deserving of the merits
of Christ'$ resurrection_
Paul says his
in life is "that
may know him and
the power of his resurection
(Phil. 3.10). Paul knew that even in this life
the resurrection of Christ gave new power for Christian ministry and
obedience
God:
Paul connects the resurrection of Christ with the spiritual power at work
within uS when he tells the Ephesians that he is
praying that they would know
what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in US who believe,
according
[0 the
of his great might which he accomplished in Christ
when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the
heavenly places'
(Eph: 119-20). Here Paul says that the power by which
God raised Christ from the dead is the same
dower
at work within uS.
Paul
further sees us as raised in Christ when he says_
"We were buried therefore
with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father; we too might walk in newness of life:
So you also
must consider yourselves dead t0 sin and alive t0 God in Christ Jesus
(Rom:
6.4, 11). This new resurrection power in us includes power t0 gain more and
more victory over remaining sin in our lives
sin will have no dominion
over you'
(Rom: 6.14; ci.
Cor: 15.17)
even though we will never be
perfect in this life.
This resurrection power also includes power for ministry in
the work of the kingdom: It was after Jesus
resurrection that he promised his
disciples_
You shall receive power when the
Spirit has come upon YOu;
and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and
the end of the earth" (Acts 1.8).

proclaiming the gospe)
and working miracles and triumphing over the
opposition of the enemy was given to the disciples after Christ'$ resurrection

Holy
from the dead and was part of the new resurrection power that characterized
their Christian lives.
Christ'$ Resurrection Insures Our Justification: In only one passage
does Paul explicitly connect Christ'
resurection with our justification (or our
receiving
declaration that we are not guilty but righteous before God)
Paul says that Jesus
Was
put to death for our trespasses and raised for our
justification "
(Rom. 4.25). When Christ was raised
the dead, it was
God'$ declaration of approval of Christ'$ work of redemption. Because Christ
"humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on
CrOSS
(Phil. 2.8), "God has highly exalted him
(Phil. 2.9). By
Christ
from the dead, God the Father was in effect saying that he approved of
Christ $ work of
suffering and dying for our sins_
that his work was
completed
and that Christ no
longer had any need t0 remain dead There was
no penalty left to pay for sin
no more wrath of God t0 bear; nO more
liability t0 punishment
all had been completely paid for; and no guilt
remained. In the resurrection, God was saying t0 Christ;
approve of what
you have done_
and you find favor in my sight
This explains how Paul can say that Christ was "raised for Our justification"
(Rom: 4.25). If God "raised us up with him'
(Eph: 2.6) , then; by virtue of our
union with Christ; God's declaration of approval of Christ is also his
declaration of approval of us.
When the Father in essence said t0 Christ; "All
the penalty for sins has been paid and
find you not guilty but righteous in
my sight;
he was thereby
the declaration that would also apply tO us
once
trusted in Christ for salvation:
way Christ'$ resurrection also
gave final proof that he had earned our justification.
Christ'$ Resurrection Insures That We Will Receive Perfect
Resurrection Bodies As Well: The New Testament several times connects
Jesus
resurrection with our final bodily resurrection.
And God raised the
Lord and will also raise uS up by his power" (1 Cor: 6.14). Similarly; "he who
raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring US with you into
his presence
(2 Cor: 4.14). But the most extensive discussion
the
connection berween Christ $ resurrection and OuI Own is found in
Corinthians 15.12-58. There Paul says that Christ is the "first fruits of those
who have fallen asleep'
(1 Cor: 15.20). In calling Christ the "first fruits" (Gk:
aparche), Paul uses
metaphor
agriculture t0 indicate that we will be
like Christ_ Just as the "first fruits'
or the first taste of the ripening crop show
what the rest of the harvest will be like for that crop_
so Christ as the "fiSt
fruits"
shows what our resurrection bodies will be like when, in God' s final

After Jesus"
resurection, he still had the nail prints in his hands and feet and
the mark from the spear in his side (John 20.27). People sometimes wonder if
that indicates that the scars of serious injuries that we have received
this
life
also remain on Our resurrection bodies. The answer is that we
probably will not have any scars from injuries Or wounds received in this life,
but our bodies will be made perfect; "incorruptible'
and raised "in glory:-
The
scars from Jesus' crucifixion are unique because they are an eternal reminder
of his
and death for uS_
The fact that he retains those scars does
not necessarily mean that we shall retain ours. Rather; all will be healed
and
all will be made perfect and whole_
5. Ethical Significance of the Resurrection
Paul also sees thar the
resurrection has application t0 OuI obedience to God in this life. After
discussion of the resurrection, Paul concludes by encouraging his readers
Therefore; my beloved brethren, be steadfast; immovable; always
abounding
in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor
not in vain"
Cor: 15.58). It is because Christ was raised
the dead, and
too shall be
raised from the dead, that we should continue steadfastly in the Lord'$ work:
This is because everything that we do t0
people into the kingdom and
build them Up will indeed have eternal significance,
because
shall all be
raised 0n the day when Christ returns_
and
shall live with him forever:
Second
Paul encourages 4S,
when we think about the resurrection; [0 focus
on our future heavenly reward as Our
He sees the resurrection as
time
when all the struggles of this life will be repaid. But if Christ has not been
raised and
there
no resurrection, then
your faith is futile and you are still

Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished_
If for this life only
have hoped in Christ,

32). But because Christ has been raised_
and
because we have been raised with him, we are [0 seek for

When Paul says we are t0 consider ourselves

immediately
say;

and said, "Men of Galilee; why do you stand
into
heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from YOu into heaven, will
CuME
in the same way as YOu saw him go into heaven_
(Acts 1.9-I1)
These narratives describe an event that is clearly designed to show the
disciples that Jesus went to
place. He did not suddenly disappear from them,
neven
to be seen by them
but gradually ascended as
were
watching; and then _
cloud (apparently the cloud of God $ glory) took him
from their sight:
But the angels immediately said that he would come back in
the same way
which he had gone into heaven. The fact that Jesus had
resurrection body that was subject t0
limitations (it could be at only
one place at one time
means that Jesus went somewhere when he ascended
into heaven:
It is
surprising that even some evangelical theologians hesitate to affirm that
heaven is
place or that Jesus ascended to
definite location somewhere in
the space-time universe. Admittedly we cannot nOw see
where Jesus is, but
that is not because he passed into some ethereal "state of being'
that has nO
location at all in the space-time universe_
but rather because our eyes are
unable to see the unseen spiritual
world that exists all around us. There are
angels around uS
but
simply cannot see
them because our eyes do not
have that capacity: Elisha was surrounded by an army of angels and chariots
of fire
protecting him from the Syrians at Dothan
but Elisha-
servant was not
~lifting 5
they
looking
again;
they
spatial
able
see those angels until God opened his eyes S0 that he could see
that existed in that spiritual dimension (2
6.17). Similarly, when
Stephen was dying
God gave him
special ability to see the world that is
now hidden from our eyes, for he "gazed into heaven and saw the glory of
God
and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said,
Behold,
see
the heavens opened_
and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God'
(Acts 7.55-56).
And Jesus himself said, "In my Father'
house are many
rooms; if it were not SO,
would
have told you that
g0 t0 prepare
place for
you? And when
g0 and prepare
place for you_
will come
and will
take you t0
myself; that where
am YOu may be also
(John 14.2-3).
Of course we cannot nOW say exactly where heaven is. Scripture often
pictures people as
ascending Up into heaven (as Jesus did, and Elijah) or
coming down
heaven (as the angels in Jacob's dream, Gen. 28.12) , so
we are
justified in
of heaven as somewhere
above
the earth:
Admittedly the earth is round and
rotates, SO where heaven is we are simply
unable t0 say more precisely
Scripture does not tell us. But the repeated
emphasis on the fact that Jesus went somewhere (as did Elijah_
2.11) ,
and the fact that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God
(Rev:
21.2) , all indicate that there is clearly
localization of heaven in the
space-time universe. Those who do not believe in Scripture may scoff at such
an idea and wonder how
can be S0, just as the first Russian cosmonaut who
came back trom space and declared that he did not see God
heaven
anywhere
but that simply points to the blindness of their eyes toward the
unseen spiritual world; it does not indicate that heaven does not exist in
certain place. In
the ascension of Jesus into heaven is designed t0 teach
uS that heaven does exist as
place in the space-time universe. (See chaprer
57 for
further discussion of the nature of heaven )
2. Christ Received Glory and Honor That Had Not Been His Before As
the God-Man:
When Jesus ascended into heaven he received glory; honor;
and authority that had never been his before as one who was both God and
man_
Before Jesus died, he prayed, "Father; glorify me in your own presence
with the glory which
had with you before the world was made
(John
17.5).
In his sermon at Pentecost Peter said that Jesus was
exalted at the
right hand of God" (Acts 2.33), and Paul declared that
God has highly
exalted him" (Phil. 2.9) , and that he was "taken up in glory
Tim. 3.16; cf:
Heb_
1.4). Christ is nOw in heaven with the
choirs singing praise
him with the words, "Worthy
the Lamb who was slain, to receive power
and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!'
(Rev:
5.12).

3. Christ Was Seated at God's Right Hand (Christ's Session). One specific
aspect of Christ $ ascension into heaven and receiving of honor was the fact
that he sat down at the right hand of God. This is sometimes called his session
at God'$ right hand:
The Old Testament predicted that the Messiah would sit at the right hand of
God: "The LORD says t0 my lord: *Sit at my right hand, till
make your
enemies your footstool'
(Ps. 110.1). When Christ ascended back into heaven
he received the fulfillment of that promise:
When he had made purification
for sins
he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high" (Heb: 1.3)
This web
into the presence of God and
at God $ right hand is
dramatic indication of the completion of Christ'$ work of redemption: Just as
human being
sit down at the completion of
large task [0 enjoy the
satisfaction of having accomplished it, so Jesus sat at the right hand of God,
visibly demonstrating that his work of redemption was completed.
In addition
showing the completion of Christ's work of redemption, the act
of sitting at God'$ right hand is an indication that he received authority over
the universe. Paul says that God
raised him from the dead and made him sit
at his right hand in the heavenly places_
far above all rule and authority and
power and dominion_
and above every name that is named" (Eph:
1.20-21).
Similarly, Peter says that Jesus "has gone into heaven and is at the right hand
of God_
with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him" (1 Peter 3.22).
Paul also alludes t0 Psalm 110:1 when he says that Christ "muSt reign until he
has put all his enemies under his feet"
Cor: 15.25).
One additional aspect of the authority that Christ received from the Father
when he sat at his right hand was the authority t0 pour out the Holy Spirit on
the church_
Peter says on the Day of Pentecost;
Being therefore exalted at the
right hand of God_
and having received from the Father the promise of the
Holy Spirit; he has poured out this which you see and hear" (Acts 2.33).
The fact that Jesus nOw sits at the right hand of God in heaven does not mean
that he is perpetually "fixed" there or that he is inactive. He is also seen as
standing at God s right hand (Acts 7.56) and as walking among the seven
lampstands in heaven (Rev: 2.1). Just as
human
sits on his
royal
throne at his accession to the kingship, but then engages in many other
activities throughout each day; so Christ sat at the right hand of God as
dramatic evidence of the completion of his redemptive work and his reception
of authority over the universe_
but he is certainly engaged in other activities in
heaven as well:

Christ's Ascension Has Doctrinal Significance for Our Lives. Just as the
resurrection has profound implications for our lives_
so Christ' $ ascension has
significant implications for US. First, since we are united with Christ in every
aspect of his work of redemption;
Christ'$ going Up into heaven
foreshadows our future ascension into heaven with him: "We who are alive;
who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the
Lord in the air; and S0 we shall always be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4.17)
The
author of Hebrews wants US [0 run the race of life with the knowledge that we
are following
Jesus' steps and will eventually arrive at the blessings of life
in heaven that he is now enjoying: "Let US run with perseverance the race that
is ser before uS,
to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who
for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame_
and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. 12.1-2).
And Jesus
himself says that he will one day take us t0 be with himself (John 14.3)
Second;
Jesus
ascension gives US assurance that our final home will be in
heaven with him. "In my Father
house are many rooms; if it were not SO,
would
have told you that
g0 t0 prepare
place for you? And when
go and
prepare
place fOr YOU,
come again and will
take you t0
myself; that
where
am YOu may be also"
(John 14.2-3). Jesus was
Mdm
like us in every
way yet without sin, and he has gone before US SO that eventually we might
follow him there and live with him forever: The fact that Jesus has already
ascended into heaven and achieved the
set before him gives great
assurance
uS that we will eventually go there also.
Third, because of our union with Christ in his ascension; we are
to share
now (in part) in Christ'$ authority over the universe_
and we will later share
it more fully. This is what Paul points tO when he says that God
raised us up
with him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"
(Eph 2.6). We are not physically present in heaven, of course
for we remain
here on earth at the present time. But if Christ'$ session at God'$ right hand
refers t0 his reception of authority, then the fact that God has made us sit with
Christ means that we share in some measure in the authority that Christ has,
authority to contend against "the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places
(Eph
6.12; cf:
vv: 10-18) and to do battle with weapons that "have
divine power
destroy strongholds" (2 Cor: 10.4).
This sharing in Christ $
authority over the universe will be made more fully our possession in the age
t0 come: "Do you not know that we are
judge angels?"
Cor: 6.3).
Moreover; we will share with Christ in his authority over the creation that
God has made (Heb. 2.5-8).
Jesus promises, "He who conquers and who
keeps my works until the end
will give him power over the nations
and he
looking
will
goal
able
shall rule them with
rod of iron; as when earthen pots are broken in pieces_
even as

my Father" (Rev 2.26-27). He
also promises; "He who conquers_
grant hin t0 sit with me on my
throne_
myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne
(Rev. 3.21). These are amazing promises of Our future sharing in Christ's
sitting atthe right hand of God, promises that we will not fully understand
until the age
come_
sutes ol Jal Christ
In talking about the life, death, and resurrection of Christ; theologians have
sometimes talked about the
states of Jesus Christ
By this they mean the
different relationships Jesus had to God's law for mankind_
to the possession
of authority, and t0
receiving honor for himself. Generally two states
(humiliation and exaltation) are distinguished. Thus, the doctrine of "the
rwofold state of Christ" is the
that Christ experienced first the state
of humiliation, then the state of exaltation:
Within the humiliation of Christ are included his incarnation, suffering; death;
and burial. Sometimes
fifth aspect (descent into hell) is included
but as
explained above; the position taken in this book is that that concept is nOt
supported in Scripture
In the exaltation of Christ, there are also four aspects: his resurrection,
ascension into heaven, session at the right hand of God
and return in glory
and power: Many systematic theologies use the state of humiliation and the
state of exaltation as broad categories
organize their discussion of Jesus
work:
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
As yOu read this chapter; what aspects of the Bible

body make you feel?
What
would you like t0 do now but find yourself unable t0 do
because of the weakness or limitations of your own physical body? Do
you think these activities would be appropriate
your life in heaven?
Will you be able t0 do them then?
When yOu were born again, YOu received new spiritual life within. If yOu
think of this new spiritual life as
of the resurrection power of Christ

The Offices of Christ
How is Christ prophet; priest; and king?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
There were three major offices among the people of Israel in the Old
Testament: the prophet (such as Nathan,
Sam: 7.2), the priest (such as
Abiathar;
Sam: 30.7)
and the king (such as
David,
Sam: 5.3). These
three offices were distinct The prophet spoke God'
words t0 the people; the
priest offered sacrifices_
prayers_
and praises to God on behalf of the people;
and the
ruled over the people as God $ representative_
These three offices
foreshadowed Christ'$ own work in different ways. Therefore we can look
at Christ'
work; nOw
thinking about the perspective of these three
offices 01
categories_
Christ fulfills these three offices in the
following ways:
as prophet he reveals God tO us and speaks God's words t0 us; as priest he
both offers
sacrifice t0 God on our behalf and is himself the sacrifice that is
offered; and as
he rules over the church and over the universe as well.
We nOw

discuss each of these offices

The Old Testament prophets
God's words to the people. Moses was the
first major prophet; and he wrote the first five books of the Bible_
the
Pentateuch After Moses there was
succession of other prophets who spoke
and wrote God $ words_
But Moses predicted that sometime another prophet
like himself would come_
The LORD your God will raise up for YOu
prophet like me from
among You; from your brethren
him you shall heed
~just as YOu
desired of the LORD your God.
And the LORD said t0 me
will raise up for them
prophet like you from among their brethren;
and
will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all
that
command him.
(Deut: 18.15-18)

spoke
However; when we look at the gospels we see that Jesus is not
primarily viewed as
prophet or as the prophet like Moses, though
there are occasional references t0 this effect_ Often those who call
Jesus
propher" know very little about him
For instance
various
opinions of Jesus
circulating:
Some say John the Baptist,
others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets -
(Matt: 16.14; cf: Luke 9.8).
When Jesus raised the son of the widow
of Nain from the dead, the people were afraid and said,
A great
prophet has arisen among us! " (Luke 7:16). When Jesus told the
Samaritan woman at the well something of her past life, she
immediately responded; "Sir;
perceive that you are
prophet'
(John 4.19). But she did not then know very much at all about him:
The reaction of the man born blind who was healed in the temple
similar:
He
prophet" (John 9.17; note that his belief in
Jesus' messiahship and deity did not come until v 37, after
subsequent conversation with Jesus)
Therefore,
prophet" is not
primary designation of Jesus Or one used frequently by him or
about him:
Nevertheless, there was still an expectation that the prophet like
Moses would come (Deut: 18.15, 18).
For instance, after Jesus had
multiplied the loaves and fish, some people exclaimed, "This is
indeed the prophet who is t0 come into the worldl" (John 6.14; cf:
7.40) . Peter also identified Christ as the prophet predicted by Moses
(see Acts 3.22-24, quoting Deut: 18.15). So Jesus is indeed the
prophet predicted by Moses:
Nevertheless, it is significant that in the Epistles Jesus is never
called
prophet or the prophet: This
especially significant in the
opening chapters of Hebrews, because there was
clear opportunity
identify Jesus as
prophet if the author had wished to do so. He
begins by saying,
"In many and various ways God
of old t0
our fathers by the prophets; but in these last
he has spoken t0
uS by
Son "
(Heb 1:1-2). Then after discussing the greatness of
the
chapters 1-2, the author concludes this section not by
saying
"Therefore_
consider Jesus
the greatest prophet of all;" or
something like that; but rather by saying; "Therefore, holy brethren,
who share in
heavenly call_
consider Jesus_
the apostle and high
priest of our confession"
(Heb: 3.1).
Why did the New Testament epistles avoid calling Jesus
prophet?
Apparently because, although Jesus is the prophet whom Moses
Were
spoke
days
Son,
predicted
yet he is also far greater than any of the Old Testament
prophets
in [WO ways:
1. He is the one about whom the prophecies in the Old Testament
were made.
When Jesus
with the two disciples on the road t0
Emmaus, he took them through the entire Old Testament, showing
how the prophecies pointed t0 him:
And beginning with Moses
and all the prophets, he interpreted tO them in all the scriptures the
things concerning himself"
(Luke 24.27). He told these disciples
that
were
slow of heart t0 believe all that the prophets had
spoken,
that it was
necessary that the Christ should
suffer these
and enter into his glory" (Luke 24.25-26; cf:
Peter 1.HL
which says that the Old Testament prophets were
predicting the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory'
Thus, the Old Testament prophets looked forward to Christ in what
they wrote, and the New Testament apostles looked back to Christ
and interpreted his life for the benefit of the church:
2. Jesus was not merely
messenger of revelation from God (like
all the other prophets ) , but was himself the source of revelation
from God. Rather than saying_
as all the Old Testament prophets
did,
Thus says the LORD_
Jesus could begin divinely authoritative
teaching with the
statement; "But
say unto
(Matl:
5.22; et al.) The word of the Lord came t0 the Old Testament
prophets
but Jesus spoke on his Own authority as the eternal Word
of God (John 1:1) who perfectly revealed the Father t0 us (John
14.9; Heb. 1.1-2).
In the broader sense of prophet; simply
one who reveals
God t0 us and
[0 uS the words of God_
Christ is of course
truly and fully
prophet. In fact; he is the one whom all the Old
Testament prophets prefigured in their speech and in their actions.
Chrit j5 Priest
In the Old Testament; the priests were appointed by God t0 offer
sacrifices
also offered prayers and praise to God on behalf of
the people
In so doing they "sanctified" the people or made them
acceptable
come into God'$ presence, albeit in
limited way
during the Old Testament
period. In the New Testament Jesus
becomes our great high priest: This theme is developed extensively
in the letter t0 the Hebrews, where we find that Jesus functions as
priest in [WO ways:
spoke
they
showing
things
anazing
You"
meaning
speaks
They
Jesus Offered
Perfect Sacrifice for Sin: The sacrifice which Jesus
offered for sins was not the blood of animals such as bulls 0r goats: "For it is
impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins" (Heb_
10.4) . Instead, Jesus offered himself as
perfect sacrifice: "But as it is_
he has
appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself" (Heb. 9.26). This was
completed and
sacrifice
never [0 be
repeated_
theme frequently emphasized in the book of Hebrews (see 7.27;
9.12, 24-28; 10.1-2, 10, 12, 14; 13.12). Therefore Jesus fulfilled all the
expectations that were prefigured, not only in the Old Testament sacrifices
but also in the lives and actions of the priests who offered them: he was both
the sacrifice and the priest who offered the sacrifice. Jesus
now the
great
high priest who has passed through the heavens'
(Heb_
4.14) and who has
appeared "in the presence of God on our behalf" (Heb. 9.24) , since he has
offered
sacrifice that ended for all time the need for any further sacrifices:
Jesus Continually Brings Us Near to God: The Old Testament priests nOt
only offered sacrifices_
but also in
representative way they
into the
presence of God from time to time on behalf of the people: But Jesus does
much more than that.
As Our perfect high priest; he continually leads US into
God'$ presence S0 that we no longer have need of a Jerusalem temple, or of a
special
priesthood tO stand between uS and God. And Jesus does not come
into the inner part (the holy of holies) of the earthly temple in Jerusalem, but
he has
into the heavenly equivalent t0 the holy of holies_
the very
presence of God himself in heaven (Heb: 9.24). Therefore we have
hope
that follows him there: "We have this as
sure and steadfast anchor of the
soul;
that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain; where Jesus
has gone as
forerunner on our behalf; having become
high priest for ever"
(Heb. 6.19-20). This means that we have
far greater privilege than those
people who lived at the time of the Old Testament temple_
could not
even enter into the first room of the temple; the holy place
for only the priests
could go there. Then into the inner room of the temple
the holy of holies_
only the high priest could go, and he could only enter there once
year (Heb
9.1-7).
But when Jesus offered
perfect sacrifice for sins, the curtain or veil
of the temple that closed off the holy of holies was torn in two from top
bottom (Luke 23.45), thus indicating in
symbolic way on earth that the way
of access t0 God in heaven was opened by Jesus"
death: Therefore the author
of Hebrews can make this amazing exhortation to all believers:
Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence t0 enter the sanctuary
[lic: 'the
places;' meaning both the
place
and the 'holy of
holies' itself] by the blood of Jesus
and since
have
priest over the house of God_

of faith: (Heb_
10.19-22)
Jesus has opened for US the way of access
God s0 that we can continually
"draw near" into God $ very presence without fear but with
confidence-
and
in "full assurance of faith:
3. Jesus as Priest Continually Prays for Us.
Une other priestly function in
the Old Testament was t0 pray on behalf of the people:
The author of
Hebrews tells us that Jesus also fulfills this function: "He is able for all time
tO save those who draw near t0 God through him, since he always lives t0
make intercession for them
(Heb: 7.25). Paul affirms the same point when he
says Christ Jesus
the one "who indeed intercedes for uS
(Rom: 8.34).
Some have
that this work of
priestly intercession is
only the act of remaining in the Father
presence as
continual
reminder that he himself has
the penalty for all our sins.
According
this view, Jesus does not actually make specific
prayers t0 God the Father about individual needs
lives_
but
"intercedes
only in the sense of remaining in God'$ presence as
our high priestly representative_
However; this view does not seem to fit the actual language used in
Romans 8.34 and Hebrews 7.25. In both cases; the word intercede
translates the Greek term entygchano. This word does not mean
merely
[0 stand as someone
representative before another
person,
but clearly has the sense of
specific requests 0r"
petitions before someone.
For example, Festus uses this word to say
Agrippa
You see this man about whom the whole Jewish
people petitioned me'
(Acts 25.24)_
Paul also uses
of Elijah when
he "pleads with God against Israel" (Rom: 11.2). In both cases the
requests are very
specific, not just general representations_
We may conclude, then; that both Paul and the author of Hebrews
saying that Jesus continually lives in the presence of God
make
requests and
bring specific petitions before God on
our behalf:
This is
role that Jesus
as God-man;
uniquely
qualified t0 fulfill Although God could care for all 0ur needs in
response t0 direct observation (Matt: 6.8), yet
has pleased God, in
his relationship to the human race; t0 decide t0 act instead in
response tO prayer; apparently so that the faith shown through
prayer might glorify him. It is especially the prayers of men and
women created in his image that are pleasing in God s sight: In
high
argued
paid ,
making
King
specilic
Christ;
have
true man,
perfect man, praying and thereby
continually glorifying God through prayer: Thus
human manhood
is raised [0
highly exalted position: "There is one God
and there
is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"
Tim: 2.5).
Yet in his human nature alone Jesus could not of course be such
great high priest for all his people all over the world_
He could nOr
hear the prayers of persons far away; nor could he hear prayers that
were only spoken in
person`
mind. He could not hear all requests
simultaneously (for in the world at any one moment there are
millions of people praying t0 him) Therefore_
in order t0 be the
perfect high priest who intercedes for uS
he must be God as well as
man. He must be one who in his divine nature can both know all
and
them into the presence of the Father: Yet because
he became and continues t0 be man he has the right t0 represent uS
before God and he can express his petitions from the viewpoint of
sympathetic high priest; one who understands by experience what
we go through
Therefore, Jesus is the only person in the whole universe for all
eternity who can be such
heavenly high priest; one who is truly
God and truly man, exalted forever above the heavens_
The thought that Jesus
continually praying for us should give 4S
great encouragement He always prays for uS
according
[0 the
Father
will, 5O we can know that his requests will be granted
Berkhof says:
It is
consoling thought that Christ is praying for US,
even when we are
negligent in our prayer life-
that He is presenting t0 the Father those
spiritual needs which were not present to OUI minds and which we often
neglect t0 include in our prayers; and that He prays for 0ur protection
against the dangers of which we are not even conscious, and against the
enemies which threaten uS, though we d not notice iL. He is praying
that our faith may not cease, and that we may
out victoriously in
the end-
CHLtARI
In the Old Testament the
has authority [0 rule over the nation
of Israel. In the New Testament; Jesus was born t0 be
of the
things
bring
come
king "
King
Jews (Matt: 2.2), but he refused any attempt by people t0 try to
make him an earthly king with earthly military and political
Wutei
(John 6.15). He told Pilate,
My
kingship is not of this world; if my
kingship were of this world, my servants would fight that
might
not be handed over t0 the Jews
but my kingship is not from the
world" (John 18.36). Nonetheless, Jesus did have
kingdom whose
arrival he announced in his
preaching (Matt: 4:17, 23; 12.28, et al.)
He is in fact the tNue
of the new people of God: Thus, Jesus
refused tO rebuke his disciples who cried out at his triumphal entry
into Jerusalem; "Blessed is the
who comes in the name of the
Lord!" (Luke 19.38; cf: vV 39-40; also Matt. 21.5; John 1.49; Acts
17.7).
After his resurrection, Jesus was given by God the Father far
greater authority over the church and over the universe_
God raised
him 4p and
him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and
above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that
which is to come; and he has put all
under his feet and has
made
the head over all
for the church" (Eph: 1.20-22;
Matt_ 28.18;
Cor: 15.25). That authority over the church and over
the universe will be more fully
recognized by people when Jesus
returns t0 earth
power and great glory to reign (Matt. 26.64;
Thes. 1.7-10; Rev: 19.11-16). On that day he will be acknowledged
and Lord of lords" (Rev: 19.16) and every knee
shall bow t0 him (Phil. 2.10).
Dur Rolsi Proplt
King'
If we look back at the situation of Adam before the fall and forward
to our future status with Christ in heaven for eternity; we can see
that these roles of prophet; priest, and
had
parallels in the
experience that God originally intended for man, and will be
fulfilled in our lives in heaven:
In the Garden of Eden
Adam was
'propher" in that he had tnue
knowledge of God and always spoke truthfully about God and
about his creation. He was
'priest" in that he was able freely and
openly to offer prayer and praise to God. There was no need of
sacrifice
pay for sins, but in another
sense of sacrifice Adam and
Eve $ work would have been offered to God
gratitude and
thanksgiving; and so would have been _
sacrifice" of another sort
king ,
King
"made

hin

~King

king
(cf: Heb: 13.15).
Adam and Eve were also "kings" (or
and
queen) in the sense of having been given dominion and rule over
the creation (Gen. 1.26-28)
After sin entered into the world, fallen human
longer
functioned as prophets, for they believed false information about
God and spoke falsely about him to others. They no longer had
priestly access to God because sin cut them off from his presence_
Instead of ruling over the creation as kings_
they were subject t0 the
harshness of the creation and tyrannized by flood, drought; and
unproductive land; as well as by tyrannical human rulers_
The
nobility of man as God had created him
t0 be
true prophet;
priest; and king
was lost through sin
There was
partial recovery of the purity of these three roles in the
establishment of the three offices of prophet; priest; and
in the
kingdom of Israel. From time t0 time godly men occupied these
offices.
But there were also false prophets_
dishonest priests, and
ungodly
and the
original purity and holiness with which God
intended man t0
these offices were never fully realized.
When Christ came;
we saw for the first time the fulfillment of these
three roles, since he was the
perfect prophet; who most fully
declared God s words
4S, the perfect high priest, who offered the
supreme sacrifice for sins and who brought his people near to God
and the true and rightful
of the universe
who will reign
forever with
scepter of righteousness over the new heavens and
new earth:
But amazingly
we as Christians even now begin to imitate Christ in
each of these roles, though in
subordinate way We have
prophetic" role as we proclaim the gospel to the world and thereby
bring God'$ saving Word to people_
whenever we speak
truthfully about God to believers or to unbelievers we are
fulfilling
prophetic" function (using the word prophetic in
very broad
sense).
We are also priests_
because Peter calls uS
royal priesthood"
Peter 2.9). He invites US t0 be built into
spiritual temple and "to
holy priesthood" as well as "to offer spiritual sacrifices
acceptable
God through Jesus Christ" ( 1 Peter 2.5)
The author of
Hebrews also views US as priests who are able
enter into the holy
king
beings =
king
kings,
fulfil
king `
facl
of holies (Heb: 10.19,22) and able t0
continually offer up
sacrifice of praise t0 God, that is_
the fruit of lips that acknowledge
his name
(Heb 13.15). He also tells us that our good works are
sacrifices
pleasing to God: "Do not neglect to do good and t0 share
what yOu have
for such sacrifices are pleasing to God" (Heb_
13.16). Paul also has
priestly role in mind for US when he writes
appeal to you therefore; brethren; by the mercies of God
present your bodies as
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to
God, which is your spiritual worship
(Rom: 12.1).
We also share in part nOw in the kingly reign of Christ, since we
have been raised to sit with him in the heavenly places (Eph: 2.6),
thus sharing to some degree in his authority over evil spiritual
forces that may be arrayed against us (Eph: 6.10-18; James 4.7;
Peter 5.9;
John 44). God has even nOw committed t0 uS authority
Uvei
various areas in this world 0r in the church; giving
some
authority over much and
some authority over little: But when the
Lord returns those who have been faithful over little will be given
authority over much (Matt: 25.14-30).
When Christ returns and nules over the new heavens and new earth;
we will once
be true
prophets
because our knowledge will
then be perfect and we shall know as
we are known
Cor: 13.12)
Then we
speak only truth about God and about his world_
and
in 4S the original prophetic purpose which God had for Adam will
be fulfilled: We will be priests forever; for we will eternally
worship and offer prayer to God as we behold his face and dwell in
his presence (Rev: 22.3-4). We will continually offer ourselves and
all that we do or have as sacrifices t0 Our most worthy
Yet we shall also_
in subjection [0 God, share in
ruling
Ovei
the
universe, for with him we shall "reign forever and ever'
(Rev:
22.5). Jesus says, "He who conquers,
will grant him to sit with me
on my throne
myself conquered and sat down with my Father
on his throne"
(Rev 3.21). In fact; Paul tells the Corinthians,
you not know that the saints will judge the world?
Do you not
know that we are [0 judge
angels?" (1 Cor: 6.2-3).
Therefore for
all eternity; we shall forever function as subordinate prophets_
priests_
and kings, yet always subject t0 the Lord Jesus, the supreme
prophet; priest; and

Chapter 30
The Work of the Holy Spirit
What are the distinctive activities of the Holy Spirit throughout the
history of the Bible?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In the previous chapters we have discussed at some length the
person and work of God the Father; and, more recently, the person
and work of God the Son, Jesus Christ. We have also examined the
biblical evidence for the deity and distinct personality of the Holy
Spirit (in connection with the doctrine of the Trinity). It is
appropriate nOW in this chapter that we focus on the distinctive
work of the Holy Spirit Among the different activities of the
members of the Trinity; what activities are said to be especially the
work of God the Holy Spirit?
We should realize at the outset that other chapters in this book deal
more or less directly with certain aspects of the Holy Spirit'$ work
The chapters on baptism in and
filling with the Holy Spirit (39) and
the gifts of the Holy Spirit (52-53) deal almost entirely with
specific works of the Holy Spirit Moreover; the chapters on the
authority of Scripture
prayer (18) , the gospel call (33),
regeneration (34), sanctification (38) , perseverance (40),
glorification (42), church discipline (46), the means of grace within
the church (48), and worship (51) all treat various aspects of the
Holy Spirit' $ work
the worid, and especially in the lives of
believers
Nonetheless
in this chapter we shall attempt to gain an
overview of the teaching of all of Scripture on the work of the Holy
Spirit in order t0 understand more fully what kinds of activities
have been especially delegated to the Holy Spirit by God the Father
and God the Son:
We may define the work of the Holy Spirit as follows: The work of
the Holy Spirit
[0 manifest the active presence of God in the
world, and especially in the church: This definition indicates that
the Holy Spirit is the member of the Trinity whom the Scripture
most often represents as
present t0 do God's work in the
world. Although this is true tO some extent throughout the Bible, it
is particularly true in the new covenant age. In the Old Testament;
the presence of God was many times manifested in the glory of God
and
theophanies
and in the
gospels Jesus himself manifested the
presence of God among men. But after Jesus ascended into heaven,
and
continuing through the entire church age, the
Spirit is now
the primary manifestation of the presence of the Trinity among uS_
He is the one who is most prominently present with us now:
From the very beginning of creation we have an indication that the
Holy Spirit $ work is t0 complete and sustain what God the Father
has planned and what God the Son has begun; for in Genesis 1.2,
"the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters:
And at
Pentecost; with the beginning of the new creation in Christ; it is the
Holy Spirit who comes t0 grant power [0 the church (Acts 1.8; 2.4,
17-18). Because the Holy Spirit is the person of the Trinity through
whom God particularly manifests his presence in the new covenant
age, it is appropriate that Paul should call the Holy Spirit the
fnuits'
(Rom_
8.23) and the
guarantee
down payment;
Cor: 1.22; 5.5) of the full manifestation of God $ presence that we
know in the new heavens and new earth (cf: Rev 21.3-4).
Even in the Old Testament; it was predicted that the presence of the
Holy Spirit would bring abundant blessings from God: Isaiah
predicted
time when the Spirit would bring great renewal
For the palace will be forsaken; the populous city deserted
until
the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes
fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed
forest: Then justice
will dwell in the wilderness_
and righteousness abide in the fruitful
field:
And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of
righteousness, quietness and trust for ever: My people will abide in a
peaceful habitation, in secure
dwellings, and
quiet resting places_
(Isa_
32.14-18)
Similarly, God prophesied through Isaiah t0 Jacob, "For
will pour water 0n
the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground;
will pour my Spirit upon
your descendants, and my
on your
offspring"
(Isa. 44.3).
By contrast; the departure of the Holy Spirit removed the blessing
being
Holy
"first
Will
blessing
of God fiom
people:
But they rebelled and grieved his holy
Spirit; therefore he turned to be their enemy; and himself fought
against them" (Isa. 63:10). Nonetheless, severa
prophecies in the
Old Testament predicted
time when the Holy Spirit would come
in greater fullness
time when God would make
ewy
covenant
with his people (Ezek: 36.26-27; 37:14; 39.29; Joel 2.28-29).
In what specific ways does the Holy Spirit
God $ blessing?
We may distinguish four aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit to
bring evidence of God's presence and to bless:
the Holy Spirit
empowers;
the Holy Spirit purifies; (3) the Holy Spirit reveals;
the Holy Spirit unifies. We will examine each of these four
activities below. Finally; we must recognize that these activities of
the
Spirit are not to be taken for granted, and they do not just
happen automatically among God'$ people. Rather; the
Spirit
reflects the pleasure 0r displeasure of God with the faith and
obedience
unbelief and disobedience
of God $ people.
Because of this
we need t0 look at
fifth aspect of the Holy
Spirit'$ activity: (5) the Holy Spirit gives stronger or weaker
evidence of the presence and blessing of God, according
response t0 him_
The Hoh
Spirit Empoiaet:
1. He Gives Life_
In the realm of nature it is the role of the Holy Spirit t0 give
life to all animate creatures
whether on the ground or in the sky and sea
for
"When you send forth your Spirit; they are created" (Ps. 104.30). Conversely;
if God "should take back his spirit to himself, and gather to himself his
breath;
all flesh would perish together; and man would return t0 dust" (Job
34.14-15). Here
see the role of the Spirit in the giving and sustaining of
human and animal life.
Parallel with this is the role of the
Spirit t0 give uS new life in
regeneration:
Jesus told Nicodemus
That which is born of the
flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit: Do not
marvel that
said t0 you;
You must be born anew
(John 36-7;
cf: vv: 5, 8; 6.63; 2 Cor: 3.6)_
He also said, "It is the Spirit who
gives life; the flesh profits nothing
(John 6.63 NASB; cf: 2 Cor:
3.6; Acts 10.44-47; Titus 3.5).
Consistent with this life-giving
function of the Holy Spirit is the fact that it was the Holy Spirit who
conceived Jesus in the womb of Mary his mother (Matt: 1:18, 20;
Luke 1.35). And on the day when Christ returns, it is the same Holy
bring
Holy
Holy
Holy
Spirit who will complete this life-giving work by giving new
resurrection life t0 our mortal bodies_
"Ifthe Spirit of him who
raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you
he who raised Christ
Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also
through his Spirit which dwells in you
(Rom_
8.11).
2. He Gives Power for Service_
Old Testament: In the Old Testament; the Holy Spirit frequently
empowered people for special service. He empowered Joshua with leadership
skills and wisdom (Num. 27:18; Deut 34.9), and empowered the judges to
deliver Israel
from their oppressors (note how "the Spirit of the LORD came
uduM
Othniel in Judg: 3.10, Gideon in 6.34, Jephthah in 11:29
and Samson
in 13.25; 14.6, 19; 15.14). The Holy Spirit came mightily upon Saul to arouse
him to battle against the enemies of Israel
Sam: 11.6), and when David was
anointed as
"the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that
day forward"
Sam: 16.13) , equipping David to fulfill the task of kingship
which God had called him:
slightly different kind of empowering
the
Holy Spirit endowed Bezalel with artistic skills for the construction of the
tabernacle and its equipment (Ex 31.3; 35.31), and with the ability
teach
these skills t0 others (Ex: 35.34).
The Holy Spirit also protected God'$ people and enabled them
overcome their enemies_
For example_
God put his Spirit in the
midst of them at the time of the exodus (Isa: 63.11-12) and
after their return from exile
put his Spirit in the midst of them tO
protect them and keep them from fear (Hag: 2.5). When Saul was
attempting t0 capture David by force; the Holy Spirit came upon
Saul '$ messengers
Sam. 19.20) and eventually upon Saul himself
23) , causing them involuntarily to fall to the ground and
prophesy for hours, thus defeating Saul $ purpose and
humiliating
him in response to his malicious show of force against David and
Samuel. In
similar way; while Ezekiel was prophesying judgment
by the power of the Holy Spirit against some of the leaders of Israel
(Ezek: 11.5), one of the leaders named Pelatiah actually died (Ezek:
11.13). In this way the
Spirit brought immediate judgment on
him.
Finally; the Old Testament predicted
time when the Holy Spirit
would anoint
Servant-Messiah in
and power:
And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
king:
later;
Holy
fullness
grear
and
understanding; the spirit of counsel and might; the spirit of
knowledge and the fear of the LORD. And his delight shall be in the
fear of the LORD. (Isa. 11.2-3)
Isaiah prophesied that God would say of this coming Servant;
have put my
Spirit upon him" (Isa. 42:1), and he himself would say; "The Spirit of the
Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me'
(Isa. 61:1; cf:
Luke 4.18).
Before leaving this discussion of the empowering of the Holy Spirit
in the Old Testament; we should note that it sometimes
said that
there was no work of the Holy Spirit within people in the Old
Testament. This idea has mainly been inferred from Jesus' words t0
the disciples in John 14.17, "He dwells with you, and will be in
you.
But we should nor conclude from this verse that there was nO
work of the Holy Spirit within people before Pentecost: Although
the Old Testament does not frequently speak of people who had the
Holy Spirit in them or who were filled with the Holy Spirit; there
are
few examples: Joshua is said to have the Holy Spirit within
him (Num 27:18; Deut: 34.9),as are Ezekiel (Ezek 2.2; 3.24),
Daniel (Dan. 4.8-9,
18; 5.11), and Micah (Mic. 3.8).
This means
that when Jesus says t0 his disciples that the Holy Spirit
dwells
with you and will be in you'
(John 14.17), he cannot mean that
there was an absolute
'withinfwithout" difference between the old
and new covenant work of the Holy Spirit:
Nor can John 7.39
yet the
pirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet
glorified"
mean that there was no activity of the
Spirit in
people $ lives before Pentecost: Both of these passages must be
different ways of saying that the more powerful, fuller work of the
Holy Spirit that is characteristic of life after Pentecost had not
begun
the lives of the disciples. The Holy Spirit had not come
within them in the way in which God had promised t0 put the Holy
Spirit within his people when the new covenant would come (see
Ezek: 36.26, 27; 37:14), nor had the Holy Spirit been poured out in
the great abundance and fullness that would characterize the new
covenant age (Joel 2.28-29). In this powerful new covenant sense _
the Holy Spirit was not yet at work within the disciples_
New 'Testament: The empowering work of the Holy Spirit in the New
Testament is seen first and most fully in his anointing and empowering of
Jesus as the Messiah: The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at his baptism
Holy
Yet
(Matt: 3.16; Mark 1:11; Luke 3.22). John the Baptist said,
saw the Spirit
descend as
dove from heaven, and
remained on him" (John 1.32)
Therefore Jesus entered into the temptation in the wilderness "full of the Holy
Spirit" (Luke 4.1), and after his temptation,
beginning of his ministry;
Jesus retumed in the power of the Spirit into Galilee
(Luke 4.14). When
Jesus came
the synagogue at Nazareth; he declared that Isaiah's
prophecy was fulfilled in himself: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
because
he has anointed me t0 preach
news t0 the poor: He has sent me to
proclaim release t0 the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at
liberty those who are oppressed
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord"
(Luke 4.18-19). The power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus
life was then seen in
his subsequent miracles_
as he cast ouL demons with
word and healed all
who came
him (Luke 4.36_
40-41). The Holy Spirit was pleased t0 dwell
Jesus and empower him; for he fully delighted in the absolute moral purity of
Jesus
life. In the context of talking about his own ministry, and the Father' $
blessing on that
Jesus says, "It is not by measure that he gives the
Spirit; the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand" (John
3.34-35). Jesus had an anointing of the Holy Spirit without measure
and this
anointing
remained on him'
(John 1.32; cf: Acts 10.38).
The
Spirit also empowered Jesus' disciples for various kinds
of ministry. Jesus had promised them
You shall receive power
when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my
witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and t0 the end
of the earth" (Acts 1.8).
There are several specific examples of the
Holy Spirit s empowering the early Christians
work miracles as
they proclaimed the gospel
(note Stephen in Acts 6.5, 8; and Paul in
Rom: 15.19;
Cor: 2.4) But the Holy Spirit also gave great pOwer
t0 the
preaching of the early church so that when the disciples were
filled with the Holy Spirit they proclaimed the Word boldly and
with great power (Acts 4.8, 31; 6.10;
Thess_
1.5;
Peter 1.12). In
general,
We Cai
say that the
Spirit speaks through the gospel
message as it is effectively proclaimed to people
hearts.
The New
Testament ends with an invitation from both the
Spirit and the
church, who
together call people to salvation: "The Spirit and the
Bride say;
Come.
And let him who hears say;
Come"
(Rev:
22:17). In fact, not only in the preaching of the gospel
message_
but
also in the reading and teaching of Scripture, the Holy Spirit
continues t0
speak to people's hearts each
(see Heb_
3.7 and
10.15,
where the author quotes an Old Testament passage and says
that the Holy Spirit is now speaking that passage
eaders).

Another aspect of
empowering Christians for service is the
Spirit'$ activity of giving spiritual gifts to equip Christians for
ministry. After listing
variety of spiritual
Paul says, "But
One
and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each
one individually just as He wills
Cor: 12.11 NASB) Since the
Holy Spirit is the one who shows 0r manifests God'$ presence in
the world, it is nOr
surprising that Paul can call spiritual gifts
"manifestations'
of the Holy Spirit ( 1 Cor: 12.7)
spiritual
gifts are active, it is another indication of the presence of God the
Holy Spirit in the church:
In the prayer lives of individual believers_
we find that the
Spirit empowers prayer and makes it effective_
We do not know
how to pray as
ought; but the Spirit himself intercedes for US
with sighs tOo deep for words'
(Rom: 8.26)_
And Paul says that
we "have access in one Spirit to the Father" (Eph: 2.18). One
specific kind of prayer that the New Testament says is empowered
by the Holy Spirit is the gift of prayer in tongues
Cor: 12.10-H;
14.2, 14-17).
Yet another aspect of the
Spirit' $ work in empowering
Christians for service is empowering people t0 overcome spiritual
opposition to the preaching of the gospel and to God'$ work in
people's lives. This pOwer in spiritual warfare was first seen in the
life of Jesus; who said, "If it is by the Spirit of God that
cast ouL
demons; then the kingdom of God has come upon
(Matt:
12.28). When Paul came t0 Cyprus he encountered opposition
Elymas the magician, but he, "filled with the_
Spirit; looked
intently at him and said,
You son of the devil, you enemy of all
righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy; will you not stop
making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? And now; behold;
the hand of the Lord is upon you; and you shall be blind and unable
[O see the sun for

Immediately mist and darkness fell upon
him and he went about

(Acts 13.9-11). The gift of "distinguishing between spirits
(1 Cor:
12.10), given by the
Spirit; is also to be
tool in this warfare
against the forces of darkness; as is the Word of God, which
functions as the
word of the Spirit" (Eph: 6.17) in spiritual
conflict

Since this member of the Trinity is called the Holy Spirit; it is not
surprising t0 find that one of his primary activities is [0 cleanse LS
from sin and t0
sanctify us" Or make Us more holy in actual
conduct of life. Even in the lives of unbelievers there is some
restraining influence of the
Spirit as he convicts the world of
sin (John 16.8-11; Acts 7.51). But when people become Christians
the Holy Spirit does an initial cleansing work in them;
decisive break with the patterns of sin that were in their lives
before.
Paul says of the Corinthians
You were washed, you
were sanctified, YOu were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ and in the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor: 6.11; see also Titus
3.5). This cleansing and purifying work of the Holy Spirit is
apparently what is symbolized by the metaphor of fire when John
the Baptist says that Jesus will baptize people
with the Holy Spirit
and with fire
(Matt: 3.11; Luke 3.16).
After the initial break with sin that the Holy Spirit
about in
our lives at conversion, he also produces in US growth in holiness of
life. He brings forth the "fruit of the Spirit" within uS
love, joy;
peace, patience_
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness
self-
control;
Gal. 5.22-23), those qualities that reflect the character of
God:
As we continually
changed into his likeness from
one degree of glory to another;'
should be reminded that "this
comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Cor: 3.18). Sanctification
comes by the power of the Holy Spirit (2 Thess. 2.13;
Peter 1.2;
cf: Rom 8.4, 15-16), s0 that
is "by the Spirit" that we are able t0
put to death the deeds of the body" and grow

(Rom: 8.13; see 7.6; Phil. 1.19).
Some people today say
purifying (or healing) work of the Holy
Spirit occurs when

which they suddenly fall to the ground in
semi-conscious state
and remain there for minutes 0r hours. Although the phrase
"slaying in the Spirit" is nowhere in Scripture;

when people fell to the ground, or fell into

of God:

Revelation to Prophets and Apostles_
In chapter
we discussed in great
detail the work of the Holy Spirit in revealing God*$ words to the Old
Testament prophets and New Testament apostles, in many cases S0 that these
words could be put into Scripture (see; for example, Num: 24.2; Ezek: 11.5;
Zech: 7.12; et al.) The whole of the Old Testament Scriptures came about
because "men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit"
Peter 1.21 NIV) Several other passages mention this work of the Holy
Spirit in Old Testament prophets (see Matt: 22.43; Acts 1.16; 4.25; 28.25;
Peter 1.21). The New Testament apostles and others who wrote words of
Testament Scripture were also guided "into all the truth" by the Holy Spirit
(John 16.13), who also spoke to the apostles what he heard from the Father
and the Son;
and declared t0 them "the
thal are t0 come
(John 16.3; cf:
Eph: 3.5). Others who were filled with the Holy Spirit also spoke or sang
words that became part of Scripture, such as Elizabeth (Luke 1.41) , Zechariah
(Luke 1.67), and Simeon (Luke 2.25).
2. He Gives Evidence of God's Presence: Sometimes
has been said that
the work of the Holy Spirit is not to call attention t0 himself but rather tO give
glory tO Jesus and t0 God the Father: But this seems t0 be
false dichotomy;
not supported by Scripture: Of course the Holy Spirit does glorify Jesus (John
16.14) and bear witness t0 him (John 15.26; Acts 5.32;
John 23;
John
4.2).
But this does not mean that he does not make his Own actions and words
known! The Bible has hundreds of verses talking about the work of the Holy
Spirit; making his work known; and the Bible is itself spoken or inspired by
the Holy Spirit?
Moreover; the Holy Spirit frequently made himself known by
phenomena that indicated his activiry; both in the Old Testament
and in the New Testament periods_
This was true when the Holy
Spirit came upon the seventy elders with Moses and
prophesied (Num: 11.25-26), and when the Holy Spirit came upon
the judges t0 enable them to do great works of power (Judg
14.6,
19; 15.14, et al.) In these instances people could see the effect of
the Holy Spirit coming on the Lord's servants. This was also true
when the Holy Spirit came mightily upon Saul and he prophesied
with
band of prophets
Sam:
10.6, 10), and it was frequently
true when he
empowered the Old Testament prophets to give public
prophecies:
The Holy Spirit also made his presence evident in
visible way
when he descended as
dove on Jesus (John 1.32), or came as
sound of
rushing wind and with visible tongues of fire on the
New
things
they
disciples at Pentecost (Acts 2.2-3). In addition, when people had
the Holy Spirit poured out on them and began to speak in tongues
praise God in
remarkable and spontaneous way (see Acts 2.4;
10.44-46; 19.6), the Holy Spirit certainly made his presence known
as well
And Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit within us would be
so powerful he would be like
river of living water flowing out
from our inmost
(see John 7.39)
simile that suggests that
people would be aware of
presence that would somehow be
perceptible:
In the lives of individual believers; the Holy Spirit does not entirely
conceal his work, but makes himself known in various ways. He
bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom:
8.16) , and cries_
Abba! Father!" (Gal 4.6). He provides
guarantee OF
down payment of our future fellowship with him in
heaven
Cor: 1.22; 5.5), and reveals his desires
uS S0 thar we
be led by those desires and follow them (Rom 8.4-16; Gal:
5.16-25). He gives gifts that manifest his presence
Cor: 12.7
11). And from time tO time he works miraculous signs and wonders
that strongly attest to the presence of God in the preaching of the
gospel (Heb. 2.4; cf:
Cor: 2.4; Rom: 15.19)
seems more accurate,
therefore
to say that although the Holy
Spirit does glorify Jesus, he also frequently calls attention to his
work and gives
recognizable evidences that make his presence
known Indeed, it seems that one of his primary purposes in the new
covenant age is
manifest the presence of God, to give indications
that make the presence of God known:
And when the
Spirit
works in various ways that can be perceived by believers and
unbelievers, this encourages people $ faith that God is near and that
he is working to fulfill his purposes in the church and to bring
blessing to his people:
3. He Guides and Directs God's People. Scripture gives many examples of
direct
guidance from the Holy Spirit to various people:
In fact; in the Old
Testament; God said that it was sin for the people to enter into agreements
with others when those agreements were
not of my Spirit" (Isa: 30.1).
Apparently the people had been deciding on the basis of their own wisdom
and common sense rather than seeking the guidance of God $
Spirit
before
entered into such agreements_
In the New Testament; the Holy
Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for his period of temptation (Matt: 41;
Luke 4.1); in fact, so strong was this
leading of the Holy Spirit that Mark can
beings ,

say that
The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness
(Mark
1.12).
In other contexts the Holy Spirit gave direct words of
guidance
people, saying
Philip
for example; "Go up and join this chariot"
(Acts 8.29) , Or telling Peter to go with three men who came to him
from Cornelius
household (Acts 10.19-20; 11.12), or
directing the
Christians at Antioch; "Set apart for me
Barabas and Saul for the
work t0 which
have called them" (Acts 13.2).
Also in the category of
"giving guidance,
but of
much more
direct and compelling kind, are several examples where the Holy
Spirit actually transported
person from one place to another:
was S0 when "the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the
eunuch saw him no more.
But Philip was found at Azotus"
(Acts 8.39-40)
the guidance in this case could hardly have been
more clear! But similar things happened tO some Old Testament
prophets_
for those who knew Elijah seemed to expect that the
Spirit of God would snatch him up and transport him somewhere (1
Kings 18.12
2.16: "It may be that the Spirit of the LORD
has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain Or into some
valley'
The Spirit of the Lord several times
Ezekiel says_
"lifted
me up
and brought him
one place or another (Ezek: 1:1; 37:1;
43.5), an experience that was also part of John' s later visions
Revelation (Rev 17.3; 21:10).
But in the vast majority of cases the leading and guiding by the
Holy Spirit is not nearly as dramatic as this. Scripture talks rather
about
day-tO-day guidance by the
Spirit
being "led" by the
Holy Spirit (Rom. 8.14; Gal. 5.18), and walking according to the
Spirit (Rom 8.4; Gal 5.16). Now it is possible t0 understand Paul
here
be referring only t0 obedience
the moral commands of
Scripture, but this interpretation seems quite unlikely, especially
since the entire context is
dealing with emotions and desires which
perceive in
more subjective way; and because Paul here
contrasts
being led by the Spirit with following the desires of the
flesh or the sinful nature:
Buc
say; walk by the Spirit; and do not gratify the desires of the flesh:
For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the
Spirit are against the flesh:
Now the works of the flesh are plain:

fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry; sorcery; enmity; strife;
jealousy; anger:
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-

If we live by the Spirit; let 4s also walk by the Spirit: Let
us have no self-conceit; no provoking of one another; no envy of one

The contrast between
desires of the flesh'
and
desires of the Spirit" implies
that our lives should be responding moment by moment [0 the desires of the
Holy Spirit, not to the desires of the flesh. Now it may be that
responding to those desires is the intellectuab

Holy Spirit in relating t0 us as persons and
and directing uS_
There are specific examples of the Holy Spirit guiding people
directly in the book of Acts_
After the decision of the Jerusalem
council, the leaders wrote in their letter (0 the churches, "It has
seemed good to the
Spirit and to US t0 lay upon YOu no greater
burden than these necessary things"
(Acts 15.28).
Verse
suggests that the council must have had
sense of the good
pleasure of the Holy Spirit in these areas:
knew what
seemed
t0 the
Spirit.
On Paul's second missionary journey;
Luke writes that they were "forbidden by the
Spirit tO speak
the word in Asia" and then that "they attempted to g0 into Bithynia,
but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" (Acts 16.6-7) . Of
LuuISE
written principle from the Old Testament Scriptures
would have led them t0 conclude that -
could not preach in Asia
Bithynia
The Holy Spirit must rather have communicated his
direct guidance to them in some specific way; whether through
words heard audibly 0r in the mind
through strong subjective
impressions of
lack of the Holy Spirit'$ presence and blessing as
they attempted t0 travel to these different areas_

in the Spirit; not knowing what shall befall me there; except that the
Holy Spirit testifies t0 me in every city that imprisonment and
afflictions await me
(Acts 20.22-23). Paul did not think he had
another choice
-so clearly did the Holy Spirit manifest his
presence and desires
him, that Paul could speak of having been
"bound" in the Spirit:
In other cases the Holy Spirit gave guidance t0 establish people in
various ministries Or church offices: So the
Spirit said to some
in the church at Antioch; "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for
the work t0 which
have called them" (Acts 13.2). And Paul could
say that the Holy Spirit had established the elders of the Ephesian
church in their office because he said_
Take heed to yourselves and
to all the flock; in which the Holy Spirit has made You overseers'
(Acts 20.28). Finally, the Holy Spirit did provide some guidance
through the means of spiritual gifts such as prophecy
Cor: 14.29
33).
He Provides
Godlike Atmosphere When He Manifests His Presence:
Because the Holy Spirit is fully God, and shares all the attributes of God, his
influence will be to bring
Godlike character Or atmosphere to the situations
in which he is active. Because he is the
Spirit he
at times bring
about
conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16.8
11).
Because God is love, the
Spirit pours God s love into our hearts (Rom:
5.5; 15.30; Col. 1.8) and often the strongly manifested presence of the Holy
Spirit will create an atmosphere of love_
Because God is
not
God of
confusion but of peace
Cor: 14.33), the Holy Spirit
an atmosphere
of peace into situations: "The kingdom of God is not food and drink; but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom: 14:17; cf. Gal:
5.22). This last verse also teaches that the Holy Spirit imparts an atmosphere
of joy (see also Acts 13.52;
Thess. 1:6). Although the list is not exhaustive
Paul summarized many of these Godlike qualities that the Holy Spirit
produces when he listed the various elements of the fruit of the Spirit in
Galatians 5.22-23.
Other elements of the atmosphere that the Holy Spirit can impart
truth (John 14.17; 15.26; 16.13;
John 5.7), wisdom (Deut:
34.9; Isa. 11.2), comfort (Acts 9.31), freedom (2 Cor: 3.17),
righteousness (Rom: 14.17),
(Rom: 15.13; cf: Gal: 5.5), an
awareness of sonship Or adoption (Rom. 8.15-16; Gal. 4.5-6) , and
evem

Cor: 3.8). The Holy Spirit also

Cor: 2.4; 2 Tim: 1:7; cf: Acts 1.8). All
of these elements of the
Spirit $ activity indicate the various
aspects of an atmosphere in which he makes his Own presence
and thereby his own character
known to the people:
He Gives Us Assurance. The Holy Spirit bears witness
with our spirits
that we are children of God" (Rom: 8.16), and gives evidence of the work of
God within us:
And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which
he has given us"
(1 John 3.24). "By this we know that -
abide in him and he
in 4S, because he has given us of his own Spirit"
John 413). The Holy
Spirit not only witnesses tO uS that we are God $ children, but also witnesses
that God abides in us and that we are
in him. Once
more than
our intellect is involved: the Spirit works t0 give uS assurance at the
subjective level of spiritual and emotional perception as well.
6. He Teaches and Illumines.
Another aspect of the Holy Spirit' $
revealing
work is
teaching certain
God's people and illumining them so that
they can understand
Jesus promised this
function especially
his disciples when he said that the
Spirit
will teach you all
and bring t0 yOur remembrance all that
have said tO you" (John 14.26), and
said, ~he will guide YOu into all the truth" (John 16.13)-
Moreover; he
promised that when his disciples were put on trial
because of persecution_
the
Holy Spirit would teach them at that time what to say (Luke 12.12; cf. Matt:
10.20; Mark 13.11) At other times the Holy Spirit revealed specific
information t0 people
showing Simeon that he would not die until he saw
the Messiah, for example (Luke 2.26) , 0r revealing to Agabus that
famine
would occur (Acts 11:28) or that Paul would be taken captive in Jerusalem
(Acts 21.11).
In other cases the Holy Spirit revealed t0 Paul that he would
suffer in Jerusalem (Acts 20.23; 21:4) and expressly said t0 Paul
thac
would happen in the latter
(1 Tim: 4.1), and revealed t0 him what God
has prepared for those who love him (1 Cor: 2:10).
The
illuminating
work of the Holy Spirit is seen in the fact that he
enables us t0 understand: "We have received not the spirit of the
world
but the Spirit which is from God_
that we might understand
the gifts bestowed on us by God"
Cor: 2.12). Therefore_
The
unspiritual man does not receive the gifts (literally,
of the
Spirit of God" but
The spiritual man judges all things'
Cor:
2.14-15).
We should pray that the Holy Spirit would give us his
illumination and thereby help us to understand rightly when we
study Scripture or when we ponder situations in our lives. Although
he did not mention the Holy Spirit specifically; the psalmist prayed

for such illumination when he asked God, "Open my eyes_
that
may behold wondrous

(Ps. 119.18).
Similarly, Paul prayed for the Christians in and around Ephesus
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory; may give
you
spirit [or: "the Spirit;'
NIV] of wisdom and of revelation in the
knowledge of him; having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you
may know what is the

what are the

and what is the

the
of his great might: (Eph: 1.17-19)
D.The Holv nirit Unilz
When the Holy Spirit was poured out on the church at Pentecost;
Peter proclaimed that the prophecy of Joel 2.28-32 was fulfilled:
But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
And in the last days
shall be, God declares_
that
will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;
and your sons and yOur daughters shall prophesy;
and your young men shall see visions,
and your old men shall dream dreams;
yes_
and on my menservants and my maidservants in those days
will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:-
(Acts 2.16-18)
There is an emphasis on the Holy Spirit
community of believers
not just
leader like Moses or Joshua
but sons and daughters, old men and
young men, menservants and maidservants
-all will receive the outpouring of
the Holy Spirit in this time.
In the event of Pentecost; the Holy Spirit created
new community
which was the church: The community was marked by
unprecedented unity; as Luke reminds uS:
And all who believed were together and had all things in common;
things

and
sold their possessions and goods and distributed them t0 all,
as any had need. And day by day; attending the temple together and
breaking bread in their homes
partook of food with
and
generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people
(Acts 2.44-47)
Paul blesses the Corinthian church with
blessing that seeks the
unifying fellowship of the Holy Spirit for all of them when he says,
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all" (2 Cor: 13.14). It is
significant that in this trinitarian verse he especially attributes the
deepening of fellowship among believers not tO the Father or the
Son but to the Holy Spirit;
statement consistent with the overall
unifying work of the Spirit in the church:
This unifying function of the Holy Spirit is also evident when Paul
tells the Philippians, "[f therefore there
any
encouragement
Christ; if there is any consolation of love; if there is any fellowship
of the Spirit
make my joy complete by being of the same mind
maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose'
(Phil. 2.1-2 NASB)
similar way; when he emphasizes the
new unity between Jews and Gentiles in the church; he says that
"through him we both have access in one Spirit t0 the Father" (Eph.
2.18) , and says that in the Lord they are built into the one new
house of God "in the Spirit" (Eph: 2.22)
When he wants
remind
them of the unity they should have as Christians he exhorts them to
eager t0 maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace'
(Eph: 4.3)
Paul's discussion of spiritual gifts also repeats this theme of the
unifying
work of the Holy Spirit: Whereas
might think that
people who have
differing gifts would not readily get
well
with each other; Paul's conclusion is just the opposite: differing
gifts draw uS [ogether; because we are forced t0 depend on each
other:
The eye cannot say t0 the hand,
have no need of you;
the head t0 the
have no need of
(1 Cor: 12.21).
These differing gifts_
Paul tells US

same Spirit; who apportions tO each one individually as he wills" (1
Cor: 12:11), s0 that in the church; "To each is given the
manifestation of the Spirit for the common good" (1 Cor:

translation).
The idea that the Holy Spirit unifies the church is also evident in
the fact that
disputes_
dissensions, factions" (Gal: 5.20
NASB) are desires of the flesh that are opposed to being "led by the
Spirit" (Gal: 5.18; cf: v 25). The Holy Spirit is the one who
produces love in our hearts (Rom: 5.5; Gal. 5.22; Col. 1:8) , and this
love "binds everything together in perfect harmony" (Col. 3.14).
Therefore when the Holy Spirit is working strongly in
church t0
manifest God'$ presence_
one evidence will be
beautiful harmony
in the church community and
overflowing love for one another:
E. The Holy Spirit Gives Stronger or Weaker Evidence of the Presence
and
Blessing of God According to Our Response to Him
Many examples in both the Old and New Testament indicate that
the Holy Spirit will bestow Or withdraw
according-
whether or not he is pleased by the situation he sees
It is
noteworthy that Jesus was completely without sin and the Holy
Spirit
remained on him" (John 1.32) and was given t0 him without
measure (John 3.34). In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit came
mightily upon Samson several times (Judg: 13.25; 14.6, 19; 15.14).
but ultimately left him when he persisted in sin (Judg: 16.20).
Similarly, when Saul persisted in disobedience the Holy Spirit
departed from him (1 Sam: 16.14). And when the people of Israel
rebelled and grieved the
Spirit he turned against them (Isa_
63.10).
Also in the New Testament the Holy Spirit can be grieved and cease
bring blessing in
situation. Stephen rebuked the Jewish leaders_
saying_
You always resist the Holy Spirit'
(Acts 7.51). Paul warns
the Ephesian Christians_
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in
whom YOu were sealed for the day of redemption
(Eph. 4.30), and
exhorts the Thessalonian church; "Do not quench the Spirit"
Thess_
5.19; cf. the metaphor of delaying
open the door and
thereby disappointing one'$ lover in Song of Sol. 5.3,6). In a
similar vein, Paul gives
serious warning
Christians not t0 defile
their bodies by joining them to
prostitute because the Holy Spirit
lives within their bodies:
Do you not know that your body
temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have
God?
You are not YOur own; YOu were bought with
price. So glorify
strife
blessing
Holy
from
God in your body" (1 Cor: 6.19-20).
Even more serious than grieving Or quenching the Holy Spirit is
deeper; more hardened disobedience to him that
strong
judgment When Peter rebuked Ananias; "Why has Satan filled
heart t0 lie t0 the Holy Spirit and to keep back
of the
proceeds of the land?" (Acts 5.3), he fell down dead. Similarly,
when Peter said t0 Ananias "
wife Sapphira
How is it that you
have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?" (Acts 5.9),
she immediately fell down dead as well: The book of Hebrews
warns those who are in
danger of
away that severe
punishment is deserved by the man "who has spured the Son of
God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was
sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace
(Heb: 10.29). For such
person there only remains
fearful prospect of judgment" (Heb_
10.27).
Finally; there remains one more level of offense
the Holy
Spirit
kind of offense is even more serious than grieving him
acting with the hardened disobedience to him that brings
discipline 0r judgment: It is possible s0 to offend the Holy Spirit
that his
convicting
work will not be brought to bear again in a
person '$ life.
Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men; but the blasphemy
against the Spirit will not be
forgiven.
And whoever says
word
against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against
the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
either
this age Or in the age
come_
(Matt. 12.31-32; cf. Mark 3.29; Luke 12.10)
These statements are made in
context in which the Pharisees willfully and
maliciously attribute t0 Satan the powerful work of the Holy Spirit that was
evident in the ministry of Jesus. Since the Holy Spirit s0 clearly manifested
the presence of God, those who willfully and maliciously spoke against him
and attributed
activity instead to the power of Satan were guilty, Jesus
said, "of an eternal sin" (Mark 3.29).
All of these passages indicate that we must be very careful not to
offend the Holy Spirit: He will not force himself on uS
against our wills (see
Cor: 14.32) , but if we resist and quench and
oppose him; then his empowering will depart and he will remove
much of the blessing of God from our lives:

On the other hand_
in the life of Christians whose conduct is
pleasing to God, the Holy Spirit will be present to bring
blessing: The
Spirit was
poured out" in fullness at Pentecost
(see Acts 2.17-18) and he now dwells within all tnue believers_
making them temples of the living God (1 Cor: 3.16; 6.19-20). We
can know close fellowship and partnership with the Holy Spirit in
our lives (2 Cor: 3.14; Phil. 2.1). He entrusts gifts (1 Cor: 12.11)
and truth (2 Tim: 1:14) and ministries (Acts 20.28) tO uS_
In fact; SO
full and abundant will be his presence that Jesus could promise that
he will flow out of our inmost being
"rivers of living
(John 7.38-39). Peter promises that his presence especially rests on
those who suffer for the sake of Christ: "If you are reproached for
the name of Christ, YOu are blessed, because the spirit of glory and
of God rests upon
Peter 4.14).
Therefore it is important that all our ministry be done in the Holy
Spirit; that
that we consciously dwell in the Godlike atmosphere
created by the Holy Spirit
the atmosphere of power; love; joy;
truth
holiness, righteousness; and peace_
But greater than these
characteristics of the atmosphere created by the Holy Spirit is the
sense of the presence of the
Spirit himself
t0 be in the
Spirit is really t0 be in an atmosphere of God $ manifested presence:
is why people in the
Testament can walk in the comfort
of the Holy Spirit (Acts 9.31), and why it is possible just to be "in
the Spirit" as John was on the Lord'$
(Rev: 1.10; cf. 4.2).
It is surprising how many particular activities are said in the New
Testament to be done "in" the Holy Spirit: it is possible t0 rejoice in
the Holy Spirit (Luke 10.21), t0 resolve or decide
something
in the
Holy Spirit (Acts 19.21), to have one'$ conscience bear witness in
the Holy Spirit (Rom. 9:1), to have access to God in the Holy Spirit
(Eph 2:18) , to pray in the Holy Spirit (Eph: 6.18; Jude 20), and to
love in the Holy Spirit (Col: 1.8). In the light of these texts_
might ask ourselves, for how many of these activities during each
day are we consciously aware of the Holy Spirit's presence and
blessing?
is also possible to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph 5.18; cf:
Luke 1.15,41,67; 4.1; Acts 2.4; 4.8; 6.3,5; 7.55; 9.17; 11.24;
13.9). To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with the
immediate presence of God himself; and it therefore will result in
feeling what God feels, desiring what God desires, doing what God

speaking by God*s power; praying and ministering in God's
strength, and knowing with the knowledge which God himself
gives.
In times when the church experiences revival the Holy
Spirit produces these results in people'$ lives in especially powerful
ways_
Therefore in our Christian lives it is important that we depend on
the Holy Spirit $ power; recognizing that any significant work is
done
Not by might, nor by power; but by my Spirit; says the LORD
of hosts"
(Zech: 4.6). Paul is emphatic in
the Galatians that
the Holy Spirit was received by faith in the beginning of their
Christian life (Gal. 3.2) and would continue t0 work according

conversion: "Having begun
with the Spirit; are YOu now
with the flesh?
Does he who
supplies the Spirit to You and works miracles among yOu do so by

Therefore we are t0 walk
according 5
t0 the
guidance of the Holy
Spirit (Rom. 8.12-16; Gal. 5.16-26) and set our minds on the
things of the Spirit (Rom. &.4-6). All our ministry; whatever form it
may take, is to be done in the power of the Holy Spirit:

This is one of the oldest hymns in any hymnal, written by an

Common Grace
What are the undeserved blessings that God gives t0 all people,
both believers and unbelievers?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Introduction and Definition
When Adam and Eve sinned,
became worthy of eternal
punishment and separation from God (Gen: 2.17). In the same way;
when human beings sin today they become liable t0 the wrath of
God and to eternal punishment: "The wages of sin is death" (Rom:
6.23). This means that once people sin
God'$ justice would require
only one thing
that they be eternally separated from God, cut off
from experiencing any
from him, and that they live forever in
hell, receiving only his wrath eternally: In
this was what
happened to angels who sinned, and it could justly have happened
LO 4S as well: "God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but
cast them into hell and committed them t0 pits of nether gloom to
be kept until the judgment"
(2 Peter 2.4).
But in fact Adam and Eve did not die at once (though the sentence
of death began to be worked out in their lives on the
thev
sinned). The full execution of the sentence of death was delayed for
many years. Moreover; millions of their descendants even
this
do not die and g0 to hell as soon as
sin; but continue [0
live for many years, enjoying countless
in this world:
How can this be? How can God continue tO give blessings I0
sinners who deserve only death
~not only
those who
ultimately be saved, but also to millions who will never be saved_
whose sins will never be forgiven?
The answer t0 these questions is that God bestows common grace:
We may define common grace as follows: Common grace is the
grace of God by which he gives people innumerable blessings that
are nOc
part of salvation: The word common here means something
they
good
fact;
day -
day
they -
blessings _
Will
that is common t0 all people and is not restricted t0 believers 0r to
the elect only:
In distinction from common grace; the grace of God that brings
people to salvation
often called "saving grace:
Of course_
when
we talk about
common grace
and "saving grace
Ke 4rE
not
implying that there are two different kinds of grace in God himself;
but only that God $ grace manifests itself in the world in two
different ways:
Common grace is different from saving grace in its
results (it does not bring about salvation), in its recipients (it is
given to believers and unbelievers alike). and in its source (it does
not directly flow from Christ $ atoning work; since Christ $ death
did not eam any measure of
forgiveness for unbelievers, and
therefore did not merit the blessings of common grace for them
either) However; on this last point it should be said that common
grace does
indirectly from Christ'$ redemptive work; because
the fact that God did not judge the world at once when sin entered it
was primarily or perhaps exclusively due to the fact that he planned
eventually to save some sinners through the death of his Son.-
Erample
OIIn Arjcr
If we look at the world around us and contrast it with the fires of
hell that the world deserves, we can immediately see abundant
evidence of God's common grace in thousands of examples in
everyday life_
We can distinguish several specific categories in
which this common grace is seen:
The Physical Realm. Unbelievers continue t0 live in this world solely
because of God $ common grace
every breath that people take is of grace
for the wages of sin is death, not life.
Moreover; the earth does not produce
only thorns and thistles (Gen. 3.18) , or remain
parched desert; but by God $
common grace it produces food and materials for clothing and shelter; often
in great abundance and diversity Jesus said, "Love your enemies and pray for
those who persecute YOu, s0 that yOu may be sons of your Father who is in
heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the
and on the good, and sends rain
on the just and on the unjust-
(Matt: 5.44-45).
Here Jesus appeals t0 God's
abundant common grace as an encouragement t0 his disciples that
[0O
should bestow love and prayer for blessing on unbelievers (cf: Luke 6.35-36).
Similarly, Paul told the people of Lystra,
In past generations he allowed all
the nations t0 walk in their Own ways; yet he did not leave himself without
witness
for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons,
flow
evile
they
satisfying your hearts with food and gladness
(Acts 14.16-17).
The Old Testament also
of the common grace of God that
comes
unbelievers aS well as t0 believers
One specific example
is Potiphar; the Egyptian captain of the guard who purchased
Joseph as
slave:
The LORD blessed the Egyptian $ house for
Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in
house and field" (Gen: 39.5).
David speaks in _
much more
general
way about all the creatures God has made:
The LORD is good
all, and his compassion is ver all that he has made:
The eyes of
all look t0 you_
and you give them their food in due season.
You
open your hand;
you satisfy the desire of every living thing" (Ps.
145.9,15-16).
These verses are another reminder that the
goodness that is found in
the whole creation is due to God's goodness and compassion:
We even see evidence of God'$ common grace in the beauty of the
natural world. Though nature itself is in
decay" and
has been
subjected to futility" (Rom: &.21,
20) because of the
curse of the fall (Gen. 3.17-19), much beauty still remains in the
natural world_
The beauty of multicolored flowers, of grass and
woodlands, of rivers and lakes and mountains and ocean shores
still remains as
daily testimony to the continuing common grace
of God: Unbelievers deserve
enjoy none of this beauty; but by
God'$ grace they can enjoy much of it for their whole lives
2. The Intellectual Realm. Satan is "a liar and the father of lies" and "there is
truth in him
(John 8.44) , because he is fully given over t0 evil and to the
irrationality and commitment to falsehood that accompanies radical evil
But
human
in the world today; even unbelievers_
are not totally given over
lying; irrationality, and ignorance_
All people are able to have some grasp
of truth; indeed_
some have great intelligence and understanding:
This also
must be seen as
result of God $ grace. John speaks of Jesus as "the true light
that enlightens every man
(John 1.9),for in his role as creator and sustainer
of the universe (nOt particularly in his role as redeemer) the Son of God
allows enlightenment and
understanding
to come t0 all people in the
world =
God'$ common grace in the intellectual realm is seen in the fact that
all people have
knowledge of God:
Although they knew God
they did not honor him as God 0r give thanks to him" (Rom: 1.21).
This means that there is
sense of God
existence and often
speaks
~bondage
beings
hunger
to know God that he allows t0 remain in people $ hearts_
evem
though
often results in many
differing man-made religions_
Therefore ,
even when speaking t0 people who held to false
religions, Paul could find
point of contact
regarding knowledge of
God '$ existence_
as he did when speaking t0 the Athenian
philosophers: "Men of Athens_
perceive that in every way YOU are
very religious_
What therefore YOu worship as unknown; this
proclaim t0 you" (Acts 17.22-23)
The common grace of God in the intellectual realm also results in
an ability tO grasp truth and distinguish it from error; and t0
experience growth in knowledge that can be used in the
investigation of the universe and in the task of subduing the earth.
This means that all science and technology carried out by non-
Christians is
result of common grace, allowing them to make
incredible discoveries and inventions_
[O develop the earth '$
resources into many material goods,
produce and distribute those
resources
and t0 have skill in their productive work: In
practical
sense this means that every time we walk into
grocery store OF
ride in an automobile 0r enter
house we should remember that we
experiencing the results of the abundant common grace of God
poured out s0 richly on all mankind_
3. The Moral Realm. God also by common grace restrains people from being
as evil as they could be.
Once again the demonic realm; totally devoted to evil
and destruction, provides
clear contrast with human society in which evil is
clearly restrained. If people persist hard-heartedly and repeatedly in following
sin over
course of time; God will eventually
give them up
to greater and
greater sin (cf. Ps. 81:12; Rom: 1.24,26, 28), but in the case of most human
they do not fall to the depths to which their sin would otherwise take
them_
because God intervenes and puts restraints on their conduct One very
effective restraint is the force of conscience: Paul says, "When Gentiles who
have not the law do by nature what the law
requires,
are
law t0
themselves;
even
though they do not have the law: 'They show that wnat tne
law requires
written on Iheir hearts
while their conscience also bears
witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse Or perhaps excuse them" (Rom:
2.14-15).
inward sense of right and wrong that God gives t0 all people
means that
will frequently approve of moral
standards that
reflect many of the mora
standards in
Scripture:
Even those who
are given up to the most base sin, Paul says, "Know God $ decree
beings
they
This
they
that those who do such
deserve t0 die'
(Rom: 1.32).
And in
many other cases this inward sense of conscience leads people to
establish laws and customs in society that are, in terms of the
outward behavior they approve or prohibit; quite like the moral
laws of Scripture: people often establish laws or have customs that
respect the sanctity of marriage and the family, protect human life,
and prohibit theft and falsehood in speech:
Because of this, people
will frequently live in ways that are morally upright and outwardly
conform [0 the moral
standards found in Scripture. Though their
moral behavior cannot earn merit with God (since Scripture clearly
says thal
nO man iS
justified before God by the law;
Gal. 3.11, and
"AlL have turned aside, together they have gone wrong; no one does
good,
not even one_
Rom. 3.12) , nevertheless in some sense less
than earning God's eternal approval or merit, unbelievers do
good.
Jesus implies this when he says, "If yOu do
those
who do
to YOu, what credit is that `
you? For even sinners do
the same
(Luke 6.33; cf. 2
12.2 and
Chron:
24.2, where
Joash is said to have done good during his reign as
with 2
Chron. 24.17-25
where he did such evil as to make it apparent that
there was not saving faith in his life). Of course, in areas where the
gospel has had great influence and the church is strong_
will have
stronger
moral influence on society than in places where the
gospel has never reached,
where it has little restraining influence
(for example_
in cannibalistic societies
~Or even in modern Westem
society where belief in the gospel
and moral absolutes have both
been abandoned by the dominant culture).
God also demonstrates his common grace by giving warnings of
final judgment
the operation of the natural world. God has so
ordered the world that living according to his moral standards
often brings rewards in the natural realm, and
violating God s
standards often brings destruction t0 people
in both cases
indicating the eventual
direction of the final judgment: Honesty;
hard work; showing love and kindness
others;
and faithfulness in
and family will (except in the most corrupt societies
much more material and emotional reward in this life than
dishonesty; laziness, cruelty; marital infidelity; and other wrongs
such as drunkenness, drug abuse
theft; and s0 forth_
These normal
consequences of sin Or righteousness should serve as
warning of

The Creative Realm: God has allowed significant measures of skill in
artistic and musical areas_
as well as in other spheres in which creativity and
can be expressed, such as athletics_
cooking, writing; and s0 forth:
Moreover; God gives t0 us an ability to appreciate beauty in many areas of
life.
And in this area as well as in the physical and intellectual realm; the
blessings of common grace are sometimes poured out on unbelievers even
more
abundantly than on believers. Yet in all cases it is
result of the grace of
God
The Societal Realm God $ grace is also evident in the existence of various
organizations and structures in human society: We see this first in the human
family, evidenced in the fact that Adam and Eve remained husband and wife
after the fall and then had children_
both sons and daughters (Gen. 5.4). Adam
and Eve's children married and formed families for themselves (Gen. 4.17
19,26). The human family persists today; not simply as an institution for
believers_
but for all people:
Human government is also
result of common grace. It was
instituted in principle by God after the flood (see Gen. 9.6), and is
clearly stated to be given by God in Romans 13:1:
There
authority except from God,
and those that exist have been instituted
by God:
Ic is clear that government is
gift from God for mankind
generally; for Paul says the ruler is "God's servant for your
and that he is "the servant of God t0 execute his wrath on the
wrongdoer" (Rom: 13.4)
One of the primary means God uses to
restrain evil in the world is human government: Human laws and
police forces and judicial systems provide
powerful deterent tO
evil actions
and these are necessary; for there is much evil in the
world that is irrational and that can only be restrained by force_
because
will not be deterred by reason or education. Of course,
the sinfulness of man can also affect goverments themselves, so
that they become corrupt and actually encourage evil rather than
encourage good. This
just to say that human government; like all
the other blessings of common grace that God gives
can be used
either for
tor evil purposes_
Other organizations in human sociery include educational
institutions_
businesses and corporations, voluntary associations
(such as many charitable and public service groups), and countless
examples of ordinary human friendship_
All of these function t0

6. The Religious Realm_
Even in the realm of human religion, God' s
common grace brings some blessings to unbelieving people. Jesus tells uS_
"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
(Matt: 5.44), and
since there is no restriction in the context simply t0 pray for their salvation,
and since the command t0 pray for OUI persecutors
coupled with
command [0 love them,
seems reasonable [0 conclude that God intends [0
answer OUI prayers even for OuI persecutors with
regard to many areas of life
Paul specifically commands that we pray "for
and all who are in
high positions'
Tim. 2:1-2). When we seek good for unbelievers it is
consistent with God's Own practice of granting sunshine and rain
on the just
and on the
unjust" (Matt: 5.45) and also consistent with the practice of Jesus
during his earthly ministry when he healed every person who was brought t0
him (Luke 4.40). There is no indication that he required all of them to believe
in him 0r t0 agree that he was the Messiah before he granted physica_
[0 them:
Does God answer the prayers of unbelievers? Although God has not
promised t0 answer the prayers of unbelievers as he has promised
to answer the prayers of those who come in Jesus' name, and
although he has no obligation t0 answer the prayers of unbelievers
nonetheless, God may out of his common grace still hear and grant
the prayers of unbelievers; thus
demonstrating his mercy and
goodness in
another way (cf: Ps. 145.9, 15; Matt. 7.22; Luke
6.35-36). This is apparently the sense of
Timothy 4.10, which
says that God is "the Savior of all men, especially of those who
believe_
Here "Savior " cannot be restricted in meaning tO
one
who forgives sins and gives eternal life_
because these things are
not given to those who do not believe;
Savior" must have
more
general sense here, namely;
one who rescues from distress_
one
who delivers _
In cases of trouble 0r distress God often does hear
the prayers of unbelievers_
and graciously delivers them from their
trouble. Moreover; even unbelievers often have
sense of
gratitude
toward God for the
goodness of creation, for deliverance from
danger; and for the blessings of family; home, friendships, and
country. In addition, unbelievers who come in close contact with
the church and perhaps associate with it for
time can have some
religious experiences that seem very close t0 the experience of
those who are saved (see Heb 4.4-6
Matt: 7.22-23).
Finally; even the proclamation of the gospeL
t0 those who do not
ultimately accept it is
clear declaration of the mercy and grace of
God, which gives clear witness tO the fact that God does not delight
facl,
kings
healing
Yet
in the death or condemnation of any of his creatures (cf. Ezek:
33.11;
Tim. 2.4).
Common Grace and Special Grace Influence Each Other: Common
grace, of course, influences and enriches the church, since apart from God'$
common grace given t0 carpenters and other kinds of craftsmen_
there would
be no church
buildings; apart from common grace given to printers and
typesetters and bookbinders (and even t0 those who work in paper mills 0r cut
trees trom forests
make paper), there would be no Bibles. In countless ways
in everyday activities the church benefits from common grace
On the other hand_
the special grace that God gives to those who are
saved brings more of the blessings of common grace t0 unbelievers
living in the realm of the church'$ influence: Unbelievers benefit
from the example of Christian lives that
see in society, from
the prayers and the acts of mercy that Christians do for the
communicy, from the knowledge of the teachings of Scripture and
its wisdom in which they find some intellectual and moral benefit;
and from the influence on laws, customS
and beliefs of
society
that comes through the social and politica
activities 0f Christians.
Historically it has often been the powerful presence of those whose

that has resulted in freedom for
slaves (in the British colonies and the United States), rights for
women, widespread public education, technological and scientific
progress, increased productivity in the economy;
high value
placed on work and thrift and honesty; and so forth:
8. Common Grace Does Not Save People_
In spite of all of this,
must
realize that common grace is different from saving grace.
Common grace does
not

it cannot and does not save
(though in the intellectua
and moral
sphere
can give some preparation t0 make people more disposed toward
accepting the gospel) Common grace restrains sin but does not change
anyone'$ foundational disposition t0 sin, nor does
in any significant
measure purify fallen human nature
We must also
recognize that the actions of unbelievers performed
by virtue of common grace do not in themselves merit God $
approval or favor: These actions do not spring from faith
"Whatever does nOt proceed from faith is sin;
Rom: 14.23), nor
they motivated by
love for God (Matt: 22.37), but rather love

people
say that the works of unbelievers that externally conform to the
laws of God are
in some sense, they nonetheless are not
in terms of meriting God
approval nor of making God
obligated t0 the sinner in any way:
Finally;
should recognize that unbelievers often receive more
common grace than believers
may be more skillful, harder
working;
more
intelligent, more creative; or have more of the
material benefits of this life to enjoy. This in no way indicates that
they are more favored by God in an absolute sense or that they will
any share in eternal salvation, but only that God distributes the
blessings of common grace in various ways, often granting very
significant blessings to unbelievers_
In all of this, they should, of
LuuISE
acknowledge God's goodness (Acts 14:17), and should
recognize that God
revealed will is that "God s kindness'
should
eventually lead them "to repentance
(Rom: 2.4).

Lammen AATO
Why does God bestow common grace on undeserving sinners who
will never come
salvation? We can suggest at least four reasons
1. To Redeem Those Who Will Be Saved: Peter says that the day of
judgment and final execution of punishment is being delayed because there
are yet more people who will be saved: "The Lord is not slow about his
promise as some count slowness_
but is forbearing toward yOu, not wishing
that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
But the day of
the Lord will come like
thief" (2 Peter 3.9-10). In fact; this reason was true
from the beginning of human history; for if God wanted to save any people
out of the whole mass of sinful humanity, he could not have destroyed all
sinners
immediately (for then there would be no human race left). He chose
rather t0 allow sinful humans [0 live for some time
that they might have an
opportunity
and also s0 that they would bear children and enable
subsequent generations to live and then hear the gospel and repent:
To Demonstrate God 's Goodness and Mercy: God $
goodness and mercy
are not only seen in the salvation of believers_
but also in the blessings he
gives
undeserving sinners.
When God "is kind to the ungrateful and the
selfish" (Luke 6.35), his kindness is revealed
the universe, to his glory

has made

Berkhof says that God
showers untold
blessings upon all men and also clearly indicates that these are the
expressions of
favorable disposition in God, which falls short however of
the positive volition to pardon their sin, to lift their sentence, and to grant
them salvation
It is not unjust for God to delay the execution of punishment upon
sin and t0 give temporary blessings to human beings
because the
punishment is not forgotten; but just delayed.

of punishment gives clear evidence of God's mercy and goodness
and love_
3. To Demonstrate God'$ Justice_
When God repeatedly invites sinners t0
come t0 faith and when they repeatedly refuse his invitations
ustice of
God in condemning them is seen much more clearly Paul warns that those
who
persist in unbelief are simply storing up more wrath for themselves:
your hard and impenitent heart you are storing Up wrath for yourself on the
day of wrath when God s righteous judgment will be revealed" (Rom. 2.5).

Finally, God*$ glory

ways by the activities of human
in all the areas in which common
grace is operative. In
developing and exercising dominion over the earth; men
and women demonstrate and reflect the wisdom of their Creator; demonstrate
God-like qualities of skill and moral virtue and authority over the universe
and SO forth:
Though all of these activities are tainted by sinful motives
they

Chapter 32
Election and Reprobation
When and why did God choose us? Are some not chosen?
In the earlier chapters we talked about the fact that we all have
sinned and deserve eternal punishment from God, and the fact that
Christ died and earned salvation for US. But nOw in this unit
(chapters 32-43) we will look at the way God applies that salvation
[O our lives.
We begin in this chapter with God's work of election,
that is, his decision [0 choose US t0 be saved before the foundation
of the world. This act of election is, of course_
nor (strictly
speaking_
part of the application of salvation t0 US, since
came
before Christ earned our salvation when he died on the cross. But
treat election at this point because it is chronologically the
beginning of God $ dealing with us in
gracious way: Therefore,
is rightly thought of as the first step in the process of God'$
bringing salvation t0 us individually:
Other steps in God $ work of
applying salvation to our lives include
our
the gospel call, our being regenerated by the Holy
Spirit;
responding in faith and repentance, and God forgiving uS
and giving 4s membership in his family; as well as granting 4S
growth in the Christian life and
keeping us faithful to himself
throughout life
At the end of our life we die and go into his
presence, then when Christ returs we receive resurrection bodies,
and the process of
acquiring salvation is complete_
Various theologians have given specific terms to
number of these
events, and have often listed them in
specific order in which they
believe that
occur in our lives
Such
list of the events in
which God applies salvation tO US is called the order of salvation,
and
sometimes referred to by
Latin phrase, ordo salutis, which
simply means
order of salvation_
Before discussing any of these
elements in the application of salvation t0 our lives_
we can give
complete list here of the elements that will be treated in the
hearing `

and number 10 occurs when Christ

We begin our discussion of the order of salvation with the first
element; election. In connection with this we will also discuss at the
end of this chapter the question of "reprobation;
the decision of
God to pass over those who will not be saved, and to punish them
for their sins.
As will be explained below, election and reprobation
are different in several important respects
and it is important tO
distinguish these so that we do not think wrongly about God or his
activily.
The term predestination is also frequently used in this discussion.
In this textbook; and in Reformed
theology generally,
predestination is
broadel
term and includes the two aspects of
election (for believers) and reprobation (for unbelievers) However;
the term double predestination
not
helpful term because it gives
standing)
the impression that both election and reprobation are carried out in
the same way by God and have no essential differences between
them, which is certainly not true. Therefore, the term double
predestination is not generally used by Reformed theologians
though it is sometimes used t0 refer [0 Reformed [eaching by those
who criticize it: The term double predestination will not be used in
this book t0 refer t0 election and reprobation, since it blurs the
distinctions between them and does not give an accurate indication
of what is actually being taught:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We may define election as follows: Election is an act of God before
creation in which he chooses some people t0 be saved, nOt on
account of any foreseen merit in them; but only because of his
sovereign good pleasure:
There has been much controversy in the church and much
misunderstanding
over this doctrine. Many of the controversial
questions regarding man '$ will and responsibility and regarding the
justice of God with respect to human choices have been discussed
some length in connection with God' $ providence (chapter 16).
We will focus here only on those additional questions that apply
specifically to the question of election:
Our approach in this chapter will be first simply t0 cite
number of
passages from the New Testament that discuss election. Then we
will attempr tO understand the purpose of God that the New
Testament authors see in the doctrine of election. Finally, we will
attempt to clarify our
understanding of this doctrine and answer
some
objections, and also t0 consider the doctrine of reprobation:

that Luke mentions the fact of election almost

believed.
In Romans 8.28-30, we read:
We know that in
everything God works for good with those who love
him,
who are called according to his purpose:
For those whom ne
foreknew he also predestined t0 be conformed
the image of his Son,
in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren_
And
those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called
he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified
In the following chapter; when talking about God'$
Jacob
and not Esau; Paul says
was not because of anything that
acob or
Esau had done; but simply in order that God $ purpose of
lection
might continue.
Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either
bad_
in order that God $ purpose of election might continue; not
because of works bur because of his call; she was told, "The elder will
serve
the younger"
As it is written, "Jacob
loved, but Esau
hated
(Rom. 9.11-13)
Regarding the fact that some of the people of Israel were saved
but
others were not, Paul says
Israel failed to obtain what
sought:
The elect obtained it; but the rest were hardened" (Rom: 11:7). Here
again Paul indicates two distinct groups within the people of Israel:
who were "the elect" obtained the salvation that they sought;
while those who were not the elect simply
were hardened:
Paul talks explicitly about God s choice of believers before the
foundation of the world
the beginning of Ephesians.
"He chose US in him before the foundation of the world, that we
should be holy and blameless before him. He destined uS in love to be
his sons through Jesus Christ, according
the purpose of his will, to
the praise of his glorious grace
(Eph:
1.4-6)
Here Paul is
to believers and he specifically says that God
chose Us"
in Christ, referring to believers generally In
similar
way; severab
verses later he says
~We who first hoped in Christ
have been destined and appointed to live for the praise of his glory"
(Eph: 1.12).

He writes t0 the Thessalonians;
"For we know; brethren beloved by
God, that he has chosen
tOr OuI
gospel came
you nOt only in
word_
but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full
conviction" (1 Thess. 1.4-5).
Paul says that the fact that the Thessalonians believed the gospel
when he preached it
'for our gospe=
came t0 YOU
in power
and with full conviction'
is the reason he knows that God chose
them: As soon as they came t0 faith Paul concluded that
ag0
God had chosen them; and therefore they had believed when he
preached_
He later writes tO the same church; "We are bound to give
thanks t0 God
always for YOu; brethren beloved by the Lord,
because God chose you from the beginning to be saved, through
sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth" (2 Thess. 2.13).
Although the next text does not specifically mention the election of
human beings; it is interesting at this point also
notice what Paul
says about
angels.
When he gives
solemn command to Timothy,
he writes; "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the
elect angels
You
keep these rules without favor" (1 Tim:
5.21).
Paul is aware that there are good angels witnessing his
command and witnessing Timothy
response t0 it; and he is s0 sure
that it is God's act of election that has affected every one of those
good
that he can call them "elect
When Paul talks about the reason why God saved us and called us
to himself; he explicitly denies that it was because of our works; but
points rather t0 God's own purpose and his unmerited grace in
etemity past: He says God is the one
who saved uS and called us
with
holy calling
noL in virtue of Our' works but in virtue of his
own purpose and the grace which he gave US in Christ JeSus ages
ago
(2 'Tim: 1.9).
When Peter writes an

churches in Asia Minor; he writes,
To God$ elect

Peter 2.9).
In John's vision in Revelation_
those who d not give in t0
persecution and begin tO worship the beast are persons whose
names have been written in the book of life before the foundation of
the world:
And authority was given
over every tribe and people

and tongue and nation, and all who dwell on earth will worship it,
every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of

(Rev: 13.7
4In
similar way;
read of the beast from the bottomless pit in
Revelation 17: "The dwellers on earth whose names have not been
written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will
marve)
to behold the beast, because
was and is not and is [0
come"
(Rev: 17.8).
B How Does the New 'Testament Present the
Teaching f Election?
After reading this list of verses on election
it is important t0 view
this doctrine in the way the New Testament itself views it
1. As a Comfort The New Testament authors often present the doctrine of
election as
comfort t0 believers. When Paul assures the Romans that "in
everything God works for
those who love him; who are called
according
t0 his purpose'
(Rom. 8.28), he gives God $ work of predestination
reason why we can be assured of this truth: He explains in the next verse_
those whom he foreknew he also predestined [0 be conformed t0 the
image of his Son
And those whom he predestined he also called
justified
glorified" (Rom. 8.29-30).
Paul '$ point is tO say that God has
always acted for the good of those whom he called to himself: If Paul looks
into the distant past before the creation of the world, he sees that God
foreknew and predestined his people to be conformed to the image of Christ:
If he looks at the recent
past he finds that God called and justified his people
whom he had predestined. And if he then looks toward the future when Christ
returns, he sees that God has determined to give perfect; glorified bodies
those who believe in Christ.
From eternity [O eternity God has acted with the
good of his people
mind_
But if God has always acted for our
and
in the future act for our good, Paul reasons, then will he not also in our
present circumstances work every circumstance
together for our
well? In this way predestination
seen as
comfort for believers in the
everyday events of life.
2. As
Reason to Praise God: Paul says_
~He destined uS in love [0 be his
sons through Jesus Christ, according t0 the purpose of his will, to the praise
of his glorious grace
(Eph 1:5
Similarly; he says_
We who first hoped
in Christ have been destined and appointed t0 live for the praise of his glory'
(Eph: 1.12).
Paul tells the Christians at Thessalonica
We give thanks to God

(1 Thess. 1.2, 4). The reason Paul can give
thanks to God for the Thessalonian Christians is that he knows God
is ultimately responsible for their salvation and has in fact chosen
them to be saved. This is made even clearer in 2 Thessalonians
2.13: "But we
bound [0 give thanks to God always fOr YOU,
brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the
beginning
be saved:
Paul was obligated to give thanks
God
for the Christians at Thessalonica because he knew that their
salvation was ultimately due t0 God $ choice of them. Therefore it
is appropriate for Paul t0 thank God for them rather than praising
them for their own saving faith
Understood in this way; the doctrine of election does increase praise
given to God for our salvation and seriously diminishes any pride
that we might feel
if we thought that Our salvation was due [0
something
uS Or"
something for which we should receive
credit.
3.As an
Encouragement
Evangelism_
Paul says,
endure everything for
the sake of the elect; that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with
its eternal glory" (2 Tim 2:10). He knows that God has chosen some people
[0 be saved;
and he sees this as an encouragement to preach the
gospel, even
if it means
enduring great suffering: Election is Paul $ guarantee that
will be some success for his evangelism, for he knows that some of the people
he speaks 0 will be the elect, and they will believe the gospel and be saved. It
is as
someone invited us t0 come fishing and said,
guarantee that you will
catch some fish

MisundersAandings cfthe Doctrina
Election Is Not Fatalistic or Mechanistic. Sometimes those who object to
the doctrine of election say that it is "fatalism

Two somewhat different objections are
involved here. By "fatalism" is meant
system in which human choices and
human decisions really do not make any difference. In fatalism; no matter
what we do
are going t0 turn out as they have been previously
ordained Therefore; it is futile t0 attempt t0 influence the outcome of events
or the outcome of our lives by putting forth any effort Or making any
significant choices, because these will not make any difference any way: In a
true fatalistic system; of course, our humanity

personality would be reduced t0 the level of
machine that simply
functions in accordance with predetermined plans and in response
predetermined causes and influences.
By contrast tO the mechanistic picture_
the New Testament presents
the entire
outworking of our salvation as
something brought about
personal God in relationship with personal creatures_
God
"destined uS
love to be his sons through Jesus Christ" (Eph: 1.5).
God's act of election was neither impersonal nor mechanistic, but
was
permeated with personal love for those whom he chose
Moreover; the personal
care of God for his creatures
even those
who rebel

about our response t0 the

genuine persons, personal creatures who make willing choices to

Jesus invites everyone

all who labor and are heavy laden, and
will give YOu rest" (Matt.
11.28). And we read the invitation at the end of Revelation: "The

(Rev: 22.17). This invitation and
many others like it are addressed to
genuine persons who are
capable of hearing the invitation and responding to it by
decision
of their wills. Regarding those who will not accept him, Jesus
clearly emphasizes their hardness of heart and their stubborn refusal

In contrast t0 the
of fatalism; we also see
much different
picture in the New Testament: Not only do we make willing choices
as real
persons, but these choices are also real choices because they
do affect the course of events in the world. They affect OuI own
lives and they affect the lives and destinies of others. So, "He who
believes in nim is not condemned; he who does not believe
condemned already; because he has not believed in the name of the
only Son of God" (John 3.18). Our personal decisions to believe or

The implication of this is that we certainly must preach the gospel,
and people's eternal

months, teaching the word of God among them
(Acts 18.11)~this
was longer than Paul stayed in any other city except Ephesus
his three missionary journeys
When Paul was told that God had
many elect people
Corinth; he stayed
long time and preached,
in order that those elect people might be saved? Paul is quite clear
about the fact that unless people preach the gospel others will not
be saved:
But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed?
And how are they [0 believe in him of whom they have never heard?
And how are they [0 hear withoul

So faith comes
from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of
Christ: (Rom: 10.14, 17)

salvation and who was not? No, he did nOt. That

Paul endured

suffering he said; "Therefore

(2 Tim 2.10).
2. Election Is Not Based on God's Foreknowledge of Our Faith: Quite
commonly people will agree that God predestines some to be saved_
but
will say that he does this by
looking into the future and seeing who
believe in Christ and who will not. If he sees that
person is going tO come [0
saving faith, then he will predestine that person t0 be saved
based on
foreknowledge of that person s faith If he sees that
person will not come
saving faith, then he does not predestine that person
be saved_
In this way;
it is thought; the ultimate reason why some are saved and some are not lies
within the people themselves, not within God. All that God does in his
predestining work is tO give confirmation t0 the decision he knows people
will make on their own. The verse commonly used to support this view is
Romans 8.29: "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be
conformed t the image of his Son.
Foreknowledge of Persons,
Not Facts: But this verse can hardly be used
to demonstrate that God based his predestination on foreknowledge of the fact
that
person
believe. The passage speaks rather of the fact that God
knew persons
those whom he foreknew'
not that he knew some fact about
them, such as the fact that they would believe. It is
personal, relational
knowledge that is spoken of here: God, looking into the future, thought of
certain people in saving relationship t0 him; and in that sense he
knew them'

This is the sense in which Paul can talk about God $

And in Ephesians Paul talks about certain people whom God chose;
including himself: "He chose US in him before the foundation of the
world" (Eph: 1:4). To talk about God choosing

people in it is not biblical election at all. But to talk about God
choosing _
group of people means that he chose specific individuals
who constituted that group-
b. Scripture Never Speaks of Our Faith As the Reason God Chose Us: In
addition
when we look beyond these specific passages that speak of
foreknowledge and look at verses that talk about the reason God chose uS_
find that Scripture never speaks of our faith or the fact that we would come tO
believe in Christ as the reason God chose uS_
Paul seems explicitly to
exclude the consideration of what people would do in life from his
understanding of God'$ choice of Jacob rather than Esau: he says, "Though
were not yet born and had done
either good or bad, in order that
God '$ purpose of election might continue
nor because of works but because
of his call, she was told, 'The elder will
the younger:
As it is written;
Jacob
loved, but Esau
hated'
(Rom: 9.11-13)
that Jacob or
Esau would do in life influenced God's decision;
was simply in order that
his purpose of election might continue
When
discussing the Jewish people who have come to faith in
Christ; Paul says, "So too at the present time there is
remnant;
chosen by grace. But if it is by grace
it is nO
longer on the basis of
works"
(Rom. 11.5-6). Here
Paul emphasizes God'$ grace
and the complete absence of human merit in the process of election.
Someone might object that faith is not viewed as
work" in
Scripture and therefore faith should be excluded from the quotation

Based on this
objection _
Paul could actually mean
"But

However; this is unlikely in this context:
Paul is not

Rather; Paul says, "He destined us in love to be his sons through
Jesus Christ; according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of
his glorious grace which he freely bestowed on uS in the Beloved"
(Eph: 1.5-6).
Now if God's grace is to be praised for election; and
human ability to believe or decision to believe, then once again
it is consistent for Paul to mention nothing of human faith but only
to mention God $ predestining activity, his purpose and will, and his
freely given grace_

In the final analysis; the difference between two views of

can be seen in the way they answer
very simple question. Given
the fact that in the final analysis some people will choose t0 accept
Christ and some people will not; the question
What makes

what ultimately makes the difference
between those who believe and those who do not? [f 0ur answer is
that it is ultimately based on something God does (namely, his
sovereign election of those who would be saved), then we see that
salvation at its most foundational level is based on
alone: On
the other hand, if we answer that the ultimate difference between
those who are saved and those who are nOt is because of something

God can look into the future and see that person

and that person B will not come t0 faith in Christ; then those facts are already
fixed, they are already determined. If we assume that God's knowledge of the
future is true (which
must be), then it is absolutely certain that person
will believe and person B will nO. There
no way that their lives could tum
out any differently than this.
Therefore it is fair t0 say that their destinies are
still determined, for they could not be otherwise_
But by what are these
destinies determined? If they are determined by God himself; then
longer have election based ultimately on
foreknowledge of faith, but rather on
God'
sovereign will
But if these destinies are not determinedby God, then
who or what determines them? Certainly no Christian would say that there is

Conclusion: Election Is Unconditional: It seems
for the previous
four reasons_
to reject the idea that election is based on God'$ foreknowledge
of our faith. We conclude instead that the reason for election is simply God s

chose US simply because he decided t0 bestow his love upon uS. It was nOt

unconditional election:
It is "unconditional" because it is not

anything that God sees in US that makes US

It must be said that the doctrine of

accept this view; as

and independent churches:

Election Means That We Do Not Have

According
to this objection, the doctrine of election denies all
the
gospel invitations that appeal to the will of man and ask people to make
choice in whether t0 respond to Christ'$ invitation 0r not In response t0 this_
must affirm that the doctrine of election is fully able t0 accommodate the
idea that we have

decisions in

we can say that God causes US t0 choose Christ
voluntarily: The mistaken assumption underlying this objection is that
choice must be absolutely free (that is, not in any way caused by God) in
order for
[0 be
genuine human choice:
2. On This Definition of Election, Our Choices Are Not Real Choices _
Continuing the discussion in the previous paragraph, someone might object
that if a choice is caused by God, it may appear to US to be voluntary and
willed by uS
but
is nonetheless not
genuine
real choice_
because it is
not absolutely free. Once
we MuSC
respond by challenging the
assumption that
choice must be absolutely free in order to be genuine or
valid
If God makes us in
certain way and then tells us that our voluntary
choices are real and genuine choices, then we must agree that they are. God is
the definition of what is real and
genuine in the universe. By contrast; we
might ask where Scripture
evem
says that our choices have t0 be free from

It does not
seem that Scripture ever
in this way:
The Doctrine of Election Makes Us Puppets
Robots, Not Real
Persons. According to this objection, if God really causes everything that -
choose with
regard tO salvation, then we are no longer real persons_
Once

The analogy of a "puppet" or
"robot"
reduces US [0
sub-human category of things that have been created by man.
But genuine human

because we
do have
genuine will and we do make voluntary decisions based on our Own
preferences and wants.
In tact;
is this ability t0 make willing choices that is
one
that distinguishes us from much of the lower creation: We are real
people created in God'$ image; and God has allowed uS t0 make genuine
choices that have real effects on our lives:
The Doctrine of Election Means That Unbelievers Never Had
Chance
to Believe:
This objection to election says that if God had decreed from
etemity that some
people would not believe, then there was no genuine
chance for them t0 believe
and the entire system functions unfairly. Two
responses can be made t0 this objection. FirSt; We must note that the Bible
does not allow uS

When

(Rom: 9.20)_
5. Election Is Unfair: Sometimes people regard the doctrine of election as
unfair; since it teaches that God chooses some t0 be saved and passes over
others_
deciding not to save them. How can this be fair?
Two responses may be given at this point. First; We must remember
that it would be perfectly fair for God not to save anyone, just as he
did with the angels: "God did not spare the
when they
sinned
but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of nether
gloom to be kept until the judgment" (2 Peter 2:4).
What would
be perfectly fair for God would be t0 do with human beings as he
did with angels
that is_
[0 save none of those who sinned and
rebelled against him:
But if he does save some at all, then this is
demonstration of grace that goes far beyond the requirements of
fairness and justice:
But at
deeper level this objection would say that it is not fair for
God
create some people who he knew would sin and be eternally
condemned, and whom he would not redeem:
Paul raises this
objection in Romans
After saying that God "has mercy upon
whomever he wills
and he hardens the heart of whomever he
(Rom: 9.18),
Paul then raises this precise objection:
You will
say t0 me
'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his
will?'
(Rom. 9.19). Here is the heart of the "unfairness" objection
against the doctrine of election. If each person's ultimate destiny is
determined by God, not by the person himself or herself (that is;
evem
when people make
willing choices that determine whether
they will be saved 0r nOL; if God
actually behind those choices
gathered
together
they
me
angels
wills"
then,
somehow causing them to occur), then how can this be fair?
Paul's response is not one that appeals
our pride
nor does he
attempt tO give
philosophical explanation of why this
just. He
simply calls on God $ rights as the omnipotent Creator:
But who are YOU
man;
answer back
God? Will what is molded
say t0 its
molder; "Why have YOu made me thus?" Has the potter no
right over the clay; to make out of the same lump one vesse)
for
beauty and another for menial use? What if God, desiring to show his
wrath and t0 make known his power; has endured with much patience
the vessels of wrath made for destruction; in order t0 make known the
riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy; which he has prepared
beforehand for glory, even us whom he has called, not from the Jews
only but also from the Gentiles? (Rom: 9.20-24)
Paul simply says that there is
point
beyond which we cannot answer back to
God or question his justice_
He has done what he has done
according -
his
sovereign will. He is the Creator; we are the creatures; and we ultimately have
no basis
which t0 accuse him of unfairness 0r injustice_
read
these words of Paul we are confronted with
decision whether or not t0
accept what God says here, and what he does, simply because he is God and
are nOL. It is
question that reaches deep into our understanding of
ourselves as creatures and of our relationship t0 God as our Creator:
This objection of unfairness takes
slightly different form when
people say that
is unfair of God t0 save some people and not to
save all. This objection is based on an idea of justice among human
that we sense intuitively We recognize in human affairs that
it is right to treat equal people in an equal way. Therefore
seems
intuitively appropriate tO US [0 say that if God is going
save some
sinners he ought to save all sinners_
But in answer t0 this objection
it must be said that we really have no right tO impose on God our
intuitive sense of what is appropriate among human beings_
Whenever Scripture begins
treat this area
goes back to God'$
sovereignty as Creator and says he has
right to do with his
creation as he wills (see Rom. 9.19-20_
quoted above):-19If God
ultimately decided to create some creatures to be saved and others
not t0 be saved, then that was his sovereign choice, and we have no
moral or scriptural
basis on which
can insist that it was not fair:

6. The Bible
That God Wills to Save Everyone_
Another objection to
the doctrine of election is that it contradicts certain passages of Scripture that
say that God wills for all to be saved. Paul writes of God our Savior;
who
desires all men t0 be saved and to come [0 the knowledge of the truth
Tim: 2.4).
And Peter says,
Lord is nOt slow about his promise as some
count slowness, but is forbearing toward YOu_
not wishing that any should
perish; but that all should reach repentance" (2 Peter 3.9). Do not these
passages contradict the idea that God has only chosen certain people to be
saved?
One common solution to this question (from the Reformed
perspective advocated in this book) is to say that these verses speak
of God $ revealed
(telling us what we should do). not his
hidden will (his eternal plans for what will happen).
The verses
simply tell us that God invites and commands every person to
repent and come t0 Christ for salvation, but they do not tell uS
anything about God s secret decrees
regarding who will be saved.
The Arminian
theologian Clark Pinnock objects to the idea that
God has
secret and
revealed
he calls it
exceedingly
paradoxical
notion f two divine wills
regarding salvation_
But
Pinnock never really answers the question of why all are not saved
(from an Arminian perspective). Ultimately Arminians also must
say that God wills something more strongly than he wills the
salvation of all people_
for in fact all are not saved: Arminians
claim that the reason why all are not saved is that God wills
preserve the free will of man more than he wills tO save everyone.
But is this nor also
distinction in two aspects of the will of
God? On the one hand God wills that all be saved (1 Tim: 2.5-6; 2
Peter 3.9). But on the other hand he wills to preserve man'$
absolutely free choice: In
he wills the second
more than
the first: But this means that Arminians also must say that
Timothy 2.5-
and
Peter 3.9 do not say that God wills the
salvation of everyone in an absolute or unqualified way
t0O
must say that the verses only refer t0 one kind or one aspect of
God'$ will
Here the difference between the Reformed and the Arminian
conception of God's will is clearly seen_
Both Calvinists and
Arminians agree that God's commands in Scripture reveal t0 4S
what he wants US [0 do_
and both
that the commands in
Says'
"The
wille
Will
"the
making
facl,
thing
-they
agree
Scripture invite uS tO repent and trust in Christ for salvation:
Therefore, in one sense both agree that God wills that we be saved
~-itis the will that he reveals tO us explicitly in the gospel
invitation.
But both sides must also say that there is something else that God
deems more important than saving everyone: Reformed theologians
say that God deems his own glory more important than saving
everyone, and that (according to Rom_
God' $ glory
also
furthered by the fact that some
not saved_
Arminian theologians
also say that
something else
more
important t0 God than the
salvation of all people, namely; the preservation of man $ free will
So in a Reformed system God's highest value is his own glory, and
in an Arminian system God's highest value is the free will of man.
These are two distinctly different conceptions of the nature of God,
and
seems that the Reformed position has much
MIURE
explicit
biblical support than the Arminian position does 0n this question:-
The Docrina
Reprchation
When we understand election as God s sovereign choice of some
persons to be saved, then there
necessarily another aspect of that
choice_
namely; God*$ sovereign decision to pass over others and
not [0 save them:
This decision of God in eternity past is called
reprobation:
Reprobation is the sovereign decision of God before
creation
pass
some persons, in sorrow
deciding not to save
them, and
punish them for their sins, and thereby t0 manifest his
justice:
In many ways the doctrine of reprobation is the most difficult of all
the
of Scripture for us to think about and to accept;
because it deals with such horrible and eternal consequences for
human beings made in the image of God: The love that God gives
uS for our fellow human
and the love thar he commands uS
to have toward our neighbor cause uS t0 recoil against this doctrine
and it is right that we feele
such dread in contemplating it: 2-It is
something that we would not want to believe; and would not
believe_
unless Scripture clearly taught it
But are there Scripture passages that speak of such
decision by
God? Certainly there are some_
Jude speaks of some persons "who
long ago were designated for this condemnation,
ungodly persons
over
reachings
beings =
who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and
our
only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" (Jude 4).
Moreover; Paul, in the passage referred to above, speaks in the
same way of Pharaoh and others:
For the Scripture says t0 Pharaoh;
have raised YOu up fOr the very
purpose of
my power in you_
that my name may be
proclaimed in all the earth:
So then he has mercy upon whomever he
wills, and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills.
What if
God
show his wrath and t0 make known his power; has
endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for
destruction? (Rom. 9.17-22)
Regarding the results of the fact that God failed to choose all for salvation,
Paul says_
"The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened" (Rom: 11.7).
And Peter says of those who reject the gospel, "they stumble because they
disobey the word, as they were destined to do" (1 Peter 2.8).
In spite of the fact that we recoil against this doctrine, we must be
careful of our attitude toward God and toward these passages of
Scripture.
We muSt never
begin
wish that the Bible was written
another way; or that
did not contain these verses_
Moreover; if
we are convinced that these verses teach reprobation, then we are
obligated both to believe
and accept it as fair and just of God,
even
though
still causes US t0 tremble in horror as we think of iL:
context
may surprise US t0 see that Jesus can thank God
both for
hiding the knowledge of salvation from some and for
revealing
to others: "Jesus declared,
thank YOu, Father; Lord of
heaven and earth, that you have hidden these
from the wise
and understanding and revealed them
babes; yea, Father; for such
was youI
gracious will'
(Matt. 11.25-26).
Moreover; we must
recognize that somehow; in God's wisdom; the
fact of reprobation and the eternal
condemnation of some
show
God's justice and also result in his glory:
Paul says_
What if God_
desiring to show his wrath and t0 make known his power; has
endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for
destruction'
(Rom: 9.22). Paul also notes that the fact of such
punishment on the
vessels of wrath
serves to show the greatness
of God $ mercy toward us: God does this "in order
make known
the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy'
(Rom 9.23)_
deny
showing

this
things
Will
We also muSt remember that there are important differences
between election and reprobation as they are presented in the Bible.
Election t0 salvation is viewed as
cause for rejoicing and praise
God, who
worthy of praise and receives all the credit for OLI
salvation (see Eph: 1.3-6;
Peter 1.1-3). God is viewed as actively
choosing us for salvation, and doing S0 in love and with delight
But reprobation is viewed as
something that
God sOITow; not
delight (see Ezek: 33.11), and the blame for the condemnation of
sinners is always
on the people or angels who rebel, never on
God himself (see John 3.18-19; 5.40). So in the presentation of
Scripture the cause of election lies in God
and the cause of
reprobation lies in the sinner: Another important difference is that
the ground of election
God $ grace,
whereas the ground of
reprobation is God '$ justice.
Therefore
double predestination'
not
helpful or accurate phrase_
because it neglects these
differences between election and reprobation:
The SOrTow of God at the death of the wicked
have no pleasure
in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way
and
Ezek 33.11) helps us understand how appropriate it was
that Paul himself felt great SOrTow when he thought about the
unbelieving Jews who had rejected Christ Paul says:
Tam speaking the truth in Christ,
am not lying; my conscience bears
me witness in the Holy Spirit, that
have great sorrow and unceasing
anguish in my heart: For
could wish that [ myself were accursed and
cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen by race
They are Israelites:
(Rom. 9.1-4)
We ought also to feel this great SOrTow as well when we think about the fate
of unbelievers_
But it might be objected at this point, if God genuinely feels sorrow
at the punishment of the wicked, then why does he allow it Or even
decree that it
come about? The answer
must be that God knows
that this
ultimately result in greater glory for himself:
will
show his power and wrath and justice and mercy in .
way that
could not otherwise be demonstrated: Certainly in our own human
experience
is possible to do something that causes US great
SOTTOw but which we know will result in
term greater
And SO
after this faint human
we may somewhat
understand that God can decree something that causes hin SOTTOw

analogy;
yet ultimately will further his glory
Practical nppichhon
WeNTI
Iecnn
In terms of our Own
relationship with God
the doctrine of election
does have significant practical application. When we think of the
biblical teaching on both election and reprobation, it is appropriate
apply it to our own lives individually: It is right for each
Christian t0 ask of himself or herself;
Why am
Christian? What
is the final reason why God decided to save me?"
The doctrine of election tells uS that
am
Christian simply
because God in eternity past decided to set his love on me_
But why
did he decide
set his love on me? Not for
anything good in me;_
but simply because he decided to love me. There is no more
ultimate reason than that:
It humbles us before God to think in this way. It makes US realize
that we have no claim on God'$ grace whatsoever: Our salvation is
totally due
grace alone
Our only appropriate response is t0 give
God eternal praise
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL
APPLICATOR
Do you think that God chose YOu individually to be saved before he
created the world? Do you think he did it on the basis of the fact that he
knew YOu would believe in Christ, Or was it
unconditional election;
not
based
anything that he foresaw in you that made YOu worthy of his
love? No matter how YOu answered the previous question, explain how
your answer makes YOu feel when you think about yourself in
relationship t0 God
Does the doctrine of election give You any comfort Or assurance about
your future?
After reading this chapter; do you honestly feel
that you would like to
give thanks or praise
God for choosing YOu t0 be saved? Do you sense
any unfairness in the fact that God did not decide to save everyone?
If you agree with the doctrine of election as presented in this chapter;
does it diminish your sense of individual personhood 0r make you feel
somewhat like
robor or
puppet in God'
hands? Do you think it
should make you feel this way?
What effect do you think this chapter will have on YOur motivation for
evangelism? Is this
positive or negative effect? Can you think of ways
in which the doctrine of election can be used as
positive
encouragement t0 evangelism (see
Thess:
1.4-5;
Tim: 2.10)?
Whether you adopt
Reformed or Arminian perspective on the question
of election
can you think of some positive benefits in the Christian life
that those who hold the opposite position from yours seem more
frequently to experience than you do? Even though you do not agree
with the other position; can yOu list some helpful concems 0r practical
truths about the Christian life that YOu might learn from that position? Is
there
anything that Calvinists and Arminians could do to bring about
greater understanding and less division on this question?

who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing
the heavenly
places_
even as he chose US in him before the foundation of the world, that we
should be holy and blameless before him. He destined uS in love to be his sons
through Jesus
according
the purpose of his will; to the praise of his
glorious grace which he freely bestowed n uS in the Beloved
HYMN
"When This Passing World Is Done'
This hymn reminds us that when
we are once in heaven and look
back 0n our life we will realize how much more
owe [0
God $
mercy and grace than we ever realized in this life
The last stanza
especially emphasizes the fact that our election is not based on
anything
in ourselves: "Chosen not for good in me_
When this

done;
When has sunk yon glaring sun ,
When we stand with Christ in glory;
Looking

The Gospel Call and Effective Calling
What is the gospel message? How does
become effective?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
When Paul talks about the way that God
salvation into ur
lives_
he says,
Those whom he predestined he also called; and
those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified
he also glorified
(Rom: 8.30)_
Here Paul points t0
definite order
which the
of salvation come tO us. Although
ag0_
before the world was made; God "predestined" uS to be his children
and to be conformed t0 the image of his Son, Paul points t0 the fact
that in the actual
outworking of his purpose in our lives God
called" us (here in this context; God the Father is specifically in
view). Then Paul immediately lists justification and glorification;
showing that these come after
Paul indicates that there is
definite order in God's
purpose (though not every aspect of
our salvation is mentioned here): So we will begin our discussion of
the different parts of our experience of salvation with the topic of
calling

CLlLE
When Paul says_
"Those whom he predestined he also called; and
those whom he called he also justified" (Rom. 8.30), he indicates
that
an act of God. In
it is specifically an act of God
the Father; for he is the one who predestines people "to be
conformed t0 the image of his Son
(Rom: 8.29). Other verses
describe more fully what this
When God calls people in
this powerful way; he calls them
out of darkness into his
marvelous light"
Peter 2.9); he calls them "into the fellowship of
his Son" (1 Cor: 1.9; cf:
Acts 2.39) and "into his own kingdom and
glory"
Thess. 2.12; cf:
Peter 5.10; 2 Peter 1.3). People who
have been called by God "belong

realm of peace (1 Cor: 7.15; Col. 315), freedom (Gal: 5.13),
(Eph: 1.18; 4.4), holiness (1 Thess. 4.7) , patient endurance of
suffering
2.20-21; 3.9), and eternal life
Tim. 6.12).
These verses indicate that no powerless, merely human calling is in
view. This calling is rather
kind of
summons'
from the King of
the universe and
has such power that it brings about the response
that
asks for in people's hearts. It is an act of God that guarantees
response; because Paul specifies in Romans 8.30 that all who
were
called" were also "justified.
This
has the capacity
to draw us out of the kingdom of darkness and bring Us into God $
kingdom s0
join in full fellowship with him: "God is
faithful, by whom yOu were called into the fellowship of his Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord" (1 Cor: 1.9).
powerful act of God is often referred to as effective calling,
distinguish it from the general gospel invitation that goes to all
people and which some people reject: This is not to say that human
gospel proclamation is not involved
In fact; God $ effective calling
comes through the human
preaching of the gospel, because Paul
says; "To this he called yOu through our gospel, so that yOu may
obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Thess. 2.14). Of
couise _
there are many who hear the general call of the gospel
message and do not respond_
But in some cases the
gospel call is
made s0 effective by the
of the Holy Spirit in people $
hearts that they do respond; we can say that they have received
effective calling
We may define effective
calling as follows: Effective calling is an
of God the Father; speaking through the human proclamation of
the gospel, in which he summons people to himself in such
way
that they respond
saving faith.
It is important that we not give the impression that people will be
saved by the power of this call apart from their Own
response [0
the gospel (ser

that effective

must always insist that this response still has t0 be

This is why prayer is s0 important t0 effective
evangelism. Unless
God works in peoples' hearts to make the proclamation of the
gospel effective
there will be no genuine saving response. Jesus
said, "No one can come t0 me unless the Father who sent me draws
him" (John 6.44).
An example of the gospel call working effectively is seen in Paul's
first visit t0 Philippi. When Lydia heard the gospel message
"The
Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul" (Acts
16.14).
In distinction from effective
which is entirely an act of God,
we may talk about the gospel call in general which comes through
human speech. This gospel call is offered to all people
even those
who do not accept it. Sometimes this gospel call is referred to as
external calling Or' general calling- By contrast; the effective calling
of God that actually brings about
willing response
the
person who hears
is sometimes called internal calling
The gospel
call
general and external and often rejected, while the effective
call is particular; internal, and always effective: However; this is not
diminish the importance of the gospel call
-it is the means God
has appointed through which effective
will come.
Without
the gospeL
call, no one could respond and be saved! "How are
believe in him of whom they have never heard?" (Rom: 10.14).
Therefore it is important to understand exactly what the gospel call
Wne elemenk
Lutpd Cll
In human preaching of the gospel, three important elements must be
included_
Explanation of the Facts Concerning Salvation:
Anyone who comes [0
Christ fOr salvation must have at least
basic
understanding of who Christ is
and how he meets our needs for salvation: Therefore an explanation of the
facts concerning salvation must include at least the following:
1. All people have sinned (Rom: 3.23).
2. The penalty for our sin is death (Rom: 6.23).
Jesus Christ died t0 pay the penalty for our sins (Rom: 5.8).
calling;
from
calling
they
But
understanding those facts and even agreeing that
are true
is not enough for
person to be saved. There must also be an
invitation fOF
personal response on the part of the individual who
will repent of his or her sins and trust personally in Christ:
2. Invitation to Respond to Christ Personally in Repentance and Faith:
When the New Testament talks about people coming to salvation it speaks in
terms of
personal response t0 an invitation from Christ himself:
That
invitation is beautifully expressed_
for example; in the words of Jesus:
Come [0 me; all yOu who are weary and burdened
and
will give you
rest Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for
and
humble in heart; and yOu will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is
easy and my burden is light. (Matt: 11.28-30 NIV)
It is important t0 make clear that these are not just words spoken
long time ag0 by
religious leader in the past. Every non-Christian
hearing these words should be encouraged to think of them as
words that Jesus Christ is even now; at this very moment;
speaking
to him or t0 her individually. Jesus Christ is
Savior who
now
alive in heaven, and each non-Christian should think of Jesus as
speaking directly
him or
saying
"Come to me
and
will
give YOu rest'
(Matt: 11.28). This is
genuine personal invitation
that seeks
personal response from each one who hears it.
John also talks about the need for personal response when he says_
"He came to his own home, and his Own people received him not:
But t0 all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave
power to become children of God" (John 1.11-12).
In emphasizing
the need t0
receive'
Christ; John, too, points t0 the necessity of an
individual response. To those inside
lukewarm church who do not
realize their spiritual blindness the Lord Jesus again issues an
invitation that calls for personal response
"Behold,
stand at the
door and knock; if any one hears my voice and opens the door;
come
tO him and eat with him; and he with me
(Rev: 3.20).
Finally; just five verses from the end of the entire Bible, there is
another invitation from the Holy Spirit and the church to come tO
Christ:
The Spirit and the Bride say; 'Come.
And let him who
hears say;
Come:
And ler him who
thirsty come; let him who
desires take the water of life without
(Rev: 22.17).
But what is involved in coming
Christ? Although this will be

price"
explained more fully in chapter 35,it is sufficient t0 note here that
if we come t0 Christ and trust him t0 save US from our sin; we
cannot any longer cling t0 sin but must
willingly renounce it in
genuine repentance
In some cases in Scripture both repentance and
faith are mentioned together when referring tO someone'$ initial
conversion (Paul said that he spent his time "testifying both [0 Jews
and to Greeks of repentance t0 God and of faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ;
Acts 20.21). But at other times only repentance of sins is
named and saving faith is assumed as an accompanying factor
"that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his
name t0 all nations
[Luke 24.47; cf:
Acts 2.37-38; 3.19; 5.31;
17.30;
Rom 2.4; 2 Cor: 7:10; et al.])
Therefore
any genuine
gospel proclamation musL
include an invitation
make
conscious
decision t0 forsake one
sins and come t0 Christ in faith;
Christ for forgiveness of sins. If either the need to repent of sins Or
the need tO trust in Christ for forgiveness is neglected, there is not a
full and true proclamation of the gospel:
But what
promised for those who come
Christ? This is the
third element of the gospel call.
3. A Promise of Forgiveness and Eternal Life_
Although the words of
personal
invitation spoken by Christ do have promises of rest; and power
become children of God, and partaking of the water of life,
it is helpful to
make explicit just what Christ promises t0 those who come t0 him in
repentance and faith: The primary thing that is promised in the gospel
message is the promise of forgiveness of sins and eternaC
life with God
For
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in
him should not perish but have eternal life
(John 3.16). And in Peter'$
preaching of the gospel
he says, "Repent therefore_
again,
your
sins may be blotted out"
(Acts 3.19; cf: 2.38).
Coupled with the promise of forgiveness and eternal life should be
assurance that Christ will accept all who come t0 him in sincere
repentance and faith seeking salvation: "Him who comes to me
will not cast our" (John 6.37).

what difference would it make if you

Before
this chapter; had you thought of Jesus in heaven speaking
the words of the gospel invitation personally t0 people even today? If
MUM -
Christians do begin to think of Jesus speaking t0 them in this way,
how do you think it will affect their response t0 the gospel?
Do you understand the elements of the gospel call clearly enough to
present them to others? Could yOu easily turn in the Bible to find four or
five appropriate verses that would explain the gospel call clearly
people? (Memorizing the elements of the gospel call and the verses that
explain it should be one of the first disciplines of anyone's Christian
life.)

Regeneration
What does it mean t0 be born
again?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We may define regeneration as follows: Regeneration is
secret act
of God
which he imparts new spiritual life t0 US. This is
sometimes called "being born again'
(using language from John
3.3-8).
Recematation
Totallz
Work ol God
In some of the elements of the
application of redemption that we
discuss in subsequent chapters
we play an active part (this is true_
for example, of conversion
sanctification and perseverance). But in
the work of regeneration we play no active role at all. It is instead
totally
work of God. We see this, for example, when John talks
about those to whom Christ gave power to become children of God
they
were born; not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of
the
of man, but of God" (John 1.13).
Here John specifies that
children of God are those who are "born
of God" and our
human will
the will of man"
does not bring about this kind of
birth
The fact that we are passive in
regeneration is also evident when
Scripture refers t0 it as
"born
"born
(cf.
James 1.18;
Peter 1.3; John 3.3-8). We did not choose t0 be made
physically alive and we did not choose to be born ~it is something
that happened tO us; similarly; these analogies in Scripture suggest
that we are entirely passive in regeneration.
sovereign work of God in regeneration was also predicted in
the prophecy of Ezekiel. Through him God promised
time in the
future when he would give new spiritual life to his people:
will
being
being
again"
This
A new heart
will give YOu, and
new spirit
will put within you;
and
take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give YOu
healt
of flesh And
put my spirit within YOu, and cause YOu tO walk in
my statutes and be careful t0 observe my ordinances_
(Ezek 36.26-
27)
Which member of the Trinity is the one who causes regeneration?
When Jesus speaks of
"born of the Spirit" (John 3.8), he
indicates that it is especially God the
Spirit who produces
regeneration. But other verses also indicate the involvement of God
the Father in
regeneration: Paul specifies that it is God who
made
uS alive
together with Christ" (Eph. 2:5; cf. Col. 2:13)
And James
says that it is the "Father of lights'
who gave US new birth: "Of his
own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be
kind of first fruits of his creatures" (James 1.17-18)-
Finally;
Peter says that God
according to his abundant mercy has given US
new birth
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead" (1 Peter 1.3, author'$ translation):
We can conclude that both
God the Father and God the Holy Spirit bring about regeneration_
What is the connection between effective
and
regeneration? As we
see later in this chapter; Scripture
indicates that regeneration must come before we can respond t0
effective
with saving faith: Therefore we can say that
regeneration comes before the result of effective
(our' faith).
But
is more difficult
specify the exact relationship in time
between regeneration and the human proclamation of the gospel
through which God works in effective calling:
At least IWO passages
suggest that God regenerates us at the same time as he speaks [O uS
in effective calling: Peter says_
You have been born anew, not of
perishable seed but of imperishable; through the living and abiding
word of God.
That word
the good news which was preached
Peter 1.23,25).
And James says, "He chose t give uS
birth through the word of truth
(James 1:18 NIV) As the gospel
comes
God
through it to summon us to himself

them regeneration, and both actions guarantee that we will respond

Exactly what happens in regeneration
mysterious
We know
that somehow
who were spiritually dead (Eph: 2.1) have been
made alive
God and in
real
sense
have been
(John 3.3_
7; Eph 2.5; Col. 2.13). But we don
understand
how this happens Or what exactly God does t0 US to give US this
new spiritual life_
Jesus says_
"The wind blows where
wills
and
you hear the sound of it, but yOu do not know whence
comes or
whither it goes; s0 it is with every one who is born of the Spirit"
(John 3.8).
Scripture views regeneration as something that affects 4S as whole
persons_
Of course_
spirits are alive
to God after regeneration
(Rom: &.10), but that is simply because we as whole persons are
affected by regeneration_
It is not just that our spirits were dead
before
we were dead to God in trespasses and sins (see Eph: 2.1)
And it is not correct t0 say that the only
that happens in
regeneration is that our spirits are made alive (as some would
teach),
for every part of us is affected by regeneration: "If any one
is in Christ, he is
new creation; the old has passed away; behold,
the new has come" (2 Cor: 5.17).
Because regeneration is
work of God within us in which he gives
uS new life it is right t0 conclude that it is an instantaneous event It
happens only once
At one moment we are spiritually dead
and
saving =
~born
very
again"
ovr
thing
then at the next moment we have new spiritual life from God.
Nevertheless;
do not always know exactly when this
instantaneous change occurs _
Especially for children growing up in
Christian home, or for people who attend an
evangelical church or
Bible study over
period of time and grow gradually in their
understanding of the gospel, there may not be
dramatic crisis with
radical change of behavior from "hardened sinner" t0
holy
saint;'
but there will be an instantaneous change nonetheless, when
God through the Holy Spirit; in an unseen, invisible way; awakens
spiritual life within. The change will become evident over time in
patterns of behavior and desires that are pleasing
God:
In other cases (in fact; probably most cases when adults become
Christians) regeneration takes place at
clearly recognizable time
at which the person realizes that previously he or she was separated
from God and spiritually dead
but immediately afterward there was
clearly new spiritual life within. The results can usually be seen at
once
heartfelt
in Christ for salvation, an assurance of
sins forgiven,
desire to read the Bible and pray (and
sense that
these are
meaningful spiritual activities),
delight in worship,
desire for Christian fellowship
sincere desire to be obedient tO
God's Word in Scripture, and
desire [0 tell others about Christ.
People may say something like this:
don:
know exactly what
happened_
but before thar moment
did not trust in Christ for
salvation
was still
wondering and questioning in my mind
Buc
after that moment
realized that
did trust in Christ and he was my
Savior: Something happened in my heart
Yet even in these cases
we are not quite sure exactly what has happened in our hearts_
It is
just as Jesus said with respect t0 the wind
~we hear its sound and
see the result; but we cannot actually see the wind itself: So it is
with the
of the Holy Spirit in our hearts.
C. In This Sense of "Regeneration;
It Comes Before
Faith
Using the verses quoted above
we have defined regeneration to be
the act of God
awakening spiritual life within Us, bringing Us from
spiritual death t0 spiritual life. On this definition, it is natural to
understand that regeneration comes before saving faith. It is in fact
this work of God that gives 4s the spiritual ability t0 respond t0
God in faith: However; when we say that
comes "before"
faith, it is important
remember that they usually come s0 close
rogether thac

4S that they are happening at

the same time. As God addresses the effective call of the gospel to
4S, he regenerates us and we respond in faith and repentance t0 this
call. So from our perspective it is hard to tell any difference in time,
especially because regeneration is
spiritual work that we cannot
perceive with our eyes O even understand with our minds
Yet there are severab
passages that tell us that this secret, hidden
work of God in our spirits does in fact come before we respond tO
God
saving faith (though often it may be only seconds before
respond):
When
talking about regeneration with Nicodemus, Jesus
said, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit; he cannot enter
the kingdom of God" (John 3.5). Now we enter the kingdom of God
when
become Christians at conversion But Jesus says that
have to be born "of the Spirit" before we can do that:
Our inability
[0 come t0 Christ 0n OuI Own ,
without an initial work of God within
US, is also emphasized when Jesus says; "No one can come t0 me
unless the Father who sent me draws him" (John 6.44) , and
No
one can come t0 me unless it is granted him by the Father" (John
6.65). This inward act of regeneration is described beautifully when
Luke says of Lydia; "The Lord opened her heart t0 give heed to
what was said by Paul" (Acts 16.14). First the Lord opened her
heart, then she was able to give heed to Paul's preaching and to
respond in faith
By contrast; Paul tells 4S,
"The man without the Spirit (literally, the
'natural man'
does not accept the things that come from the Spirit
of God, for they are foolishness t0 him; and he cannot understand
them; because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor: 2.14 NIV) He
also says of people apart from Christ,
no one understands,
No one
seeks for God" (Rom
3.11).
The solution tO this spiritual deadness and inability t0 respond only
comes when God gives uS new life within_
"But God
who is rich in
mercy; out of the
love with which he loved uS_
even when we
were dead through our trespasses_
made uS alive together with
Christ" (Eph 2.4-5). Paul also says
When YOu were dead in your
sins and in the uncircumcision of YOur sinful nature;
God made YOU
alive with Christ-
(Col: 2.13 NIV):
The idea that regeneration comes before saving faith is not always
understood by evangelicals today: Sometimes people will even say
great
something like;
"If you believe in Christ as your Savior; then (after
you believe) yOu will be born again.
But
cripture itself never says
anything like that: This new birth is viewed by Scripture as
something
that God does within uS in order t0 enable uS t0 believe
The reason that
evangelicals often think that regeneration comes
after saving faith is that they see the results (love for God and his
Word, and turning from sin) after people come to faith, and
think that regeneration must therefore have come after saving faith.
Yet here we must decide on the basis of what Scripture tells uS_
because regeneration itself is not
something
We see 0l
know abour
directly: "The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of
it; but YOu do not know whence it comes 0r whither it
so it is
with every one who is born of the Spirit" (John 3.8).
Because Christians often tend t0 focus on the results of
regeneration, rather than the hidden spiritual act of God itself, some
evangelical statements of faith have contained
that
suggests that regeneration comes after saving faith: So_
example, the statement of faith of the Evangelical Free Church of
America (which has been adapted by
number of other
evangelical
organizations) says,
We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who
through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by the
Holy Spirit and are united
together in the body of Christ of which He
is the Head. (paragraph 8)
Here the word
"regeneration'
apparently means the outward
evidence of regeneration that is seen in
changed life _
evidence
that certainly does come after saving faith Thus "being born
is thought of not in terms of the initial impartation of new life, but
in terms of the total life change that results from that impartation. If
the term "regeneration" is understood in this way; then
would be
true that regeneration comes after saving faith:
Nevertheless, if we are t0 use
language that closely conforms to the
actual
of Scripture_
would be better t0 restrict the word
'regeneration'
t0 the instantaneous, initial work 0f God in which he
imparts spiritual life t0 uS_
Then we can emphasize that
do not
see
regeneration itself but only the results of it in our lives_
and that
faith in Christ for salvation is the first result that we see. In fact;
they
goes;
wording
again"
wording
we
can never know that we have been
regenerated until we come to
faith in Christ; for that is the outward evidence of this hidden;
inward work of God_
Once we do come to saving faith in Christ, we
know that we have been born again:
By way of application, we should realize that the explanation of the
gospel message in Scripture does not take the form of
command_
"Be born again and you will be saved,
but rather; "Believe in Jesus
Christ and You will be saved
This is the consistent pattern in the
preaching of the gospel throughout the book of Acts, and also in the
descriptions of the gospel given in the Epistles.
Ganuine Kegeneraticn
Lring Reu
In an earlier section we saw
beautiful example of the first result of
regeneration in
person's life_
when Paul spoke the gospel message
to Lydia and "the Lord opened her heart t0 give heed tO what was
said by Paul" (Acts 16.14; cf:. John 6.44, 65;
Peter 1.3). Similarly;
John says, "Everyone who believes that Jesus
the Christ is born
of God"
John 5.1 NIV)
But there are also other results of
regeneration
many of which are specified in John's first epistle. For
example, John says_
"No one who is bomn of God will continue [0
sin, because God's seed remains in him; he canno g0 on sinning,
because he has been born of God" (1 John 3.9 NIV) Here John
explains that
person who is bom
has that spiritual
seed"
(that life-generating and growing power) within him, and that this
keeps the person living
life free of continual sin. This does not of
course mean that the person will have
perfect life
but only that
the pattern of life will not be one of
continuing indulgence in sin.
When people are asked to characterize
regenerated
person's life, the adjective that comes t0 mind should not be
"sinner;
but rather something like
obedient to Christ" or
obedient to Scripture_
We should notice that John says this is tnue
of everyone who
truly bom again:
No one who is born of God
will continue t0 sin:
Another way of looking at this
[0 say that
every one who does what
right has been born of him"
John
2.29).
A genuine, Christlike love
be one specific result in life:
"Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God"
John 4.7 NIV)_
Another effect of the new birth is overcoming the
world:
And his commands are not burdensome, for everyone born
again
will
of God has overcome the world" (1 John 5.3-4 NIV)
Here John
explains that regeneration gives the ability to overcome the
pressures and temprations of the world that would otherwise keep
us from
obeying God'$ commandments and following his paths
John says that we will overcome these pressures and therefore
will not be "burdensome
obey God' $ commands but; he implies
it will rather be joyful. He goes 0n to explain that the process
through which we
victory over the world is continuing in faith:
"This is the victory that has overcome the world_
even our faith"
John 5.4 NIV)_
Finally; John notes that another result of regeneration is protection
from Satan himself:
know that anyone born of God does not
continue t0 sin; the one who was bomn of God [that is, Jesus] keeps
him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him"
John 5.18 NIV)
Though there may be attacks from Satan; John reassures his readers
that
one who is
you is greater than the one who is in the
world" (1 John 4.4 NIV) and this greater power of the Holy Spirit
within us keeps us safe from ultimate spiritual harm by the evil one_
We should realize that John emphasizes these as necessary results
in the lives of those who are born again. If there is
genuine
regeneration in
person'$ life
he 0r she will believe that Jesus is
the Christ; and will refrain from
life pattern of continual sin, and
will love his brother; and will overcome the temptations of the
world_
and will be kept safe from ultimate harm by the evil one_
These passages show that it is impossible for
person
regenerated and not become truly converted_
Other results of regeneration are listed by Paul where he speaks of
the "fruit of the Spirit;
thar is_
the result in life that is produced by
the power of the Holy Spirit
within every believer:
But
the fruit of the Spirit is love; joy; peace, patience_
kindness_
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control" (Gal. 5.22-23). If
there
true regeneration then these elements of the fruit of the
Spirit will be more and more evident in that person'$ life. But by
contrast, those who are unbelievers,
including those who are
pretending t0 be believers but are nOt;
clearly lack of these
character traits in their lives. Jesus told his disciples:
Beware of false prophets
who come [0 YOu in sheep'$
clothing but
inwardly are ravenous wolves. YOu will know them by their fruits_ Are

Thus yOu will know them by their fruits_
(Matt_ 7.15-20)
Neither Jesus nor Paul nor John point to activity in the church or
miracles as evidence of
regeneration. They rather point t0 character
traits in life. In fact; immediately after the verses quoted above
Jesus wars that on the day of judgment many will say to him;
"Lord, Lord_
did we not prophesy in YOur name_
and caSt OuC
demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
But he will declare t0 them;

evidence thar

Apparently all these can
be produced in the natural man Or woman' $ OWn strength, Or' even
with the help of the evil one. But genuine love for God and his
people, heartfelt obedience to his commands, and the Christlike
character traits that Paul calls the fruit of the Spirit; demonstrated
consistently over

person
life, simply cannot
be produced by Satan or by the natural man

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Have you been born again? Is there evidence of the new birth in your
life? Do you remember
specific time when regeneration occurred in
your life? Can yOu describe how you knew that something had
happened?
2. If you (or friends who come t0 you) are not sure whether you have been
born
what would Scripture encourage YOu t0 do in order t0 gain
greater assurance (O1 t0 be truly born again for the first time)? (Note:
further discussion of repentance and saving faith is given in the next
chapter: _
Have YOu thought before that regeneration is prior

you convinced of it nOw; 0r is there still some question in your mind?

Chapter 35
Conversion (Faith and Repentance)
What is true repentance? What is saving faith? Can people accept
Jesus as Savior and not as Lord?
The last two chapters have explained how God himself (through the
human preaching of the Word) issues the gospel call to us and, by
the work of the Holy Spirit, regenerates US, imparting new spiritual
life within. In this chapter we examine OuI response tO the
gospel
call:
We may define conversion as follows: Conversion is our
willing response to the gospel call,
which we sincerely repent of
sins and place our trust in Christ for salvation:
The word conversion itself means
turning'
here it represents
spiritua
tur
turning from sin to Christ: The turning
sin is
called repentance_
and the
Christ is called faith: We can
look at each of these
lements of conversion, and in one sense it
does not matter which one we discuss first; for neither one can
occur without the other; and they must occur together when true
conversion takes place: For the purposes of this chapter;
shall
examine saving faith first, and then repentance

Knowledge Alone Is Not Enough_
Personal
faith, in the way
Scripture understands
involves more than mere
knowledge: Of course
necessary that we have some knowledge 0f who Christ
and what he has
done, for "how are they to believe
him of whom they have never heard?"
(Rom: 10.14).
But knowledge about the facts of Jesus' life, death, and
resurrection for us is not enough_
for people can know facts but rebel against
them or dislike them. For example, Paul tells us that many
know God $
laws but dislike them: "Though they know God $ decree that those who do
such
deserve t0 die
only do them but approve those who
practice them
(Rom: 1.32). Even the demons know who God is and know the
facts about Jesus' life and saving works, for James says_
You believe that
from
turing `
saving ~
people
things
(hey
God is one; You do well:
Even the demons believe
-and shudder" (James
2.19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved
Knowledge and Approval Are Not Enough. Moreover; merely knowing
the facts and approving of them Or agreeing that
are true is not enough:
Nicodemus knew that Jesus had come
God, for he said, "Rabbi,
know that yOu are
teacher come from God; forno one can do these signs
that you do
unless God is with him" (John 3.2). Nicodemus had evaluated the
facts of the situation, including Jesus' teaching and his remarkable miracles
and had drawn
correct conclusion from those facts: Jesus was
teacher
come from God. But this alone did nOr mean that Nicodemus had
faith;
for he still had to put his trust in Christ for salvation; he still had to "believe in
him." King Agrippa provides another example of knowledge and approval
without saving faith: Paul realized that King Agrippa knew and apparently
viewed with approval the Jewish Scriptures (what we now call the Old
Testament).
When Paul was 0n tria_
before Agrippa_
he said, "King Agrippa
do you believe the prophets?
know that YOu believe
(Acts 26.27). Yet
Agrippa did not have
faith, for he said t0 Paul; "In
short time yOu
think t0 make me
Christian!" (Acts 26.28).
3. [ Must Decide to Depend 0n Jesus to Save Me Personally: In addition to
knowledge of the facts of the gospel and approval of those facts, in order to
be saved,
must decide [0
depend on Jesus t0 save me. In
this
move
from being an interested observer of the facts of salvation and the teachings of
the Bible to being someone who enters into
new relationship with Jesus
Christ as
living person_
We may therefore define saving faith in the
following way: Saving faith is trust
Jesus Christ as
living person for
forgiveness of sins and for eternal life with God:
This definition emphasizes that
faith is not just -
belief in
facts but personal trust in Jesus
save me.
As we will explain in
the following chapters, much more is involved in salvation than
simply forgiveness of sins and eternal life; but someone who
initially comes to Christ seldom realizes the extent of the blessings
of salvation that will come_
Moreover; we may
rightly summarize
the two major concerns of
person who trusts in Christ as
"forgiveness of sins'
and
eternal
life with God:
Of course, eternal
life with God involves such matters as
declaration of
righteousness before God (part of justification
as explained in the
next chapter), adoption, sanctification_
and
glorification, but these
may be understood in detail later: The main
thac
concerns an unbeliever who comes
Christ is the fact that sin has
they
from
saving -
saving"
doing
saving
things
thing
separated him or her from the fellowship with God for which we
were made: The unbeliever comes to Christ seeking to have sin and
removed and [0 enter into
genuine relationship with God that
will last forever:
The definition emphasizes personal trust in Christ, not just belief in
facts about Christ. Because saving faith in Scripture involves this
personal trust; the word
dust" iS
better word [0 use in
contemporary culture than the word "faith" or "belief:
The reason
is that we can "believe" something to be true with no personal
commitment Or
dependence involved in it:
can believe thar
Canberra is the capital of Australia, or that
times
is 42, but have
no personal commitment Or dependence on anyone when
simply
believe those facts- The word faith; on the other hand, is sometimes
used today to refer tO an almost irrational commitment t0
something
spite of strong evidence to the contrary;
SOTt of irrational
decision to believe something that we are
sure is not tue! (If
your favorite football team continues t0 lose games_
someone might
encourage yOu t0 "have faith'
even though all the facts point the
opposite direction.) In these two popular senses_
the word "belief"
and the word "faith" have
meaning contrary
the biblical sense.
The word trust is closer [0 the biblicab
idea, since
we are familiar
with trusting persons in everyday life:
The more we come [0 know
person, and the more we see
that person
pattern of life that
wanants trust; the more we find ourselves able to place trust in that
person to do what he or she promises_
or t0 act in ways that we can
rely on. This fuller sense of personal trust is indicated in several
passages
Scripture
which initial saving faith is spoken of in
very personal
terms
often using analogies drawn from personal
relationships_
John says, "To all who received him, who believed in
name_
he gave power t0 become children of God" (John 1:12).
Much as we would receive
into our homes
John speaks of
receiving Christ
John 3.16 tells us that
whoever believes in him should not perish
but have eternal life.
Here John uses
surprising phrase when he
does not simply say;
Whoevem
believes him
(that is, believes that
what he says is true and able
be trusted), but rather;
whoever
believes in nim:
The Greek phrase pisteuo eis auton could also be
translated "believe into him" with the sense of trust 0r confidence
guilt _
quite
his
guest
that goes into and rests
Jesus as
person. Leon Morris can say;
"Faith, for John; is an activity which takes men right out of
themselves and makes them one with Christ
He understands the
Greek phrase pisteuo eis to be
significant indication that New
Testament faith
not just intellectual assent but includes
'moral
element of personal trust:
Such an
expression was rare Or perhaps
nonexistent in the secular Greek found outside the New Testament;
but
was well suited tO express the persona
trust in Christ thar is
involved in
saving faith:
Jesus speaks of "coming to him" in several places_
He says
that the Father gives me
come [0 me;
and him who comes t0
me
will not cast
(John 6.37). He also says, "If any one thirst;
let him come to me and drink" (John 7.37)_
similar way; he
says,
Come
me; all who labor and are heavy laden, and
will
give yOu rest: Take my yoke upon you, and leam from me; for
am
and lowly in heart; and yOu will find rest for your souls_
For
my yoke is easy; and my burden is light" (Matt: 11.28-30) . In these
passages
have the idea of coming t0 Christ and asking for
acceptance;
for living water t0 drink; and for rest and instruction:
All of these give an intensely personal picture of what is involved
faith: The author of Hebrews also asks uS t0 think of Jesus
as nOw alive in heaven; ready t0 receive us: "He is able for all time
LO save those who draw near t0 God through him, since he always
lives [0 make intercession for them
(Heb. 7.25). Jesus
pictured
here (as many times in the New Testament) as one who is nOw alive
in heaven, always able t0 help those who come
him:
Reformed
theologian J_
Packer quotes the
following paragraphs
the British Puritan writer John Owen, describing the invitation
of Christ t0 respond in personal faith:
This

Yoi
You;
These and the like
doth the Lord Christ continually declare,
proclaim; plead and urge upon the souls of sinners _
He doth it in
the preaching of the word, as if he were present with yOu, stood
amongst yOu, and spake personally t0 every one of you
He hath
appointed the ministers of the gospel
appear before YOu; and to deal
with yOu in his stead, avowing as his own the invitations which are
given YOu in his name_
(2 Cor: 5.19-20)
With this understanding of true New Testament faith, we may nOw
appreciate that when
person comes [0 [NUSt in
Christ, all three
elements must be present: There must be some basic knowledge or
understanding of the facts of the gospel There must also be
approval of, or agreement with; these facts. Such agreement
includes
conviction that the facts spoken of the gospel are true,
especially the fact that
am
sinner in need of salvation and that
Christ alone has paid the penalty for my sin and offers salvation to
me_
also includes an awareness that
need t0 trust in Christ for
salvation and that he is the only way to God, and the only means
provided for my salvation. This approval of the facts of the gospel
will also involve
desire to be saved through Christ: But all this
still does not add up to true
faith_
That comes only when
make
decision of my will to depend on, Or put my trust in, Christ
my Savior: This personal decision t0 place my trust in Christ is
something done with my heart; the central faculty of my entire
being that makes commitments for me as
whole person.
Faith Should Increase as Our Knowledge Increases. Contrary to the
current secular
understanding of "faith;
tnue New Testament faith is not
something
that is made stronger by ignorance or by
believing against the
evidence. Rather; saving faith is consistent with knowledge and true
understanding of facts. Paul says, "Faith comes
hearing-
and hearing by
the word of Christ" (Rom: 10:17 NASB) When people have true information
about Christ,
are better able to put their trust in him. Moreover; the more
we know about him and about the character of God that is completely
revealed in him, the more fully we are able to put our trust in him: Thus faith
is not weakened by
knowledge but should increase with more true knowledge:
In the case of saving faith in Christ, our knowledge of him comes
by believing
reliable testimony about him. Here
the reliable
restimony thal we
believe is the words of Scripture. Since they are
God'
very words, they are completely reliable
and we gain [rue
knowledge of Christ through them. This is why "Faith comes from
things
saving "
trom
they
hearing_
and
by the word of Christ" (Rom: 10.17 NASB)
In everyday life
we come to believe many things when we hear
testimony from
person we
consider to be reliable 0r trustworthy:
This kind of decision is even more justified here; when the actual
words of God provide that testimony and we believe it.

Repentance; like faith; is an

of Scripture regarding sin

sin and
hatred of it), and
personal decision t0 tum from it (a
renouncing of sin and
decision of the will to forsake it and lead
life of obedience t0 Christ instead). We cannot say that someone
has to actually live that changed life over
period of time before
repentance can be
genuine,
else repentance would be turned into
kind of obedience that we could do t0 merit salvation for
ourselves. Of course_
genuine repentance will result in
changed
life. In
truly repentant person will begin at once t0 live
changed life, and we can call that changed life the fruit of
repentance: But we should never attempt to require that there be

realize that mere sorrow for one

0r even

"repentance
God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts
20.21). He says that he rejoiced over the Corinthians_
nor because
you were

Corinthians 7.9-10 indicates
even true
godly grief is just one factor that leads t0 genuine repentance, but
such grief is nOr

Scripture
repentance and faith together as different aspects of
the one act of coming t0 Christ for salvation. It is not that
person
first turns from sin and next truSts in Christ; Or first trusts in Christ
and then turns from sin, but rather that both occur at the same time_
When
we turn t0 Christ for salvation from 0ur sins
are
simultaneously turning away from the sins that we

Therefore, it is clearly contrary t0 the New Testament evidence t0
about the
possibility of having true saving faith without
having any repentance for sin. It is also contrary t0 the New
Testament to speak about the possibility of someone
accepting
Christ
as Savior" but not
as Lord,
if that means simply
depending on him for salvation but not committing
forsake sin and to be obedient to Christ from that point on.
Some prominent voices within
evangelicalism have differed with
this point; arguing that
gospeb
presentation that requires
repentance as well as faith is really preaching salvation by works_
argue that the view advocated in this chapter; that repentance
and faith muSt g0 together; is
false gospel of "lordship salvation.
They would say that saving faith only involves trusting Christ as
Savior; and that submitting to him as Lord is an optional later step
that is unnecessaly for salvation.
For many who teach this view;
saving faith only requires an intellectual agreement with the facts of
the
gospel.
When Jesus invites sinners,
tO me, all who labor and
heavy laden, and
will give YOu rest;
he immediately adds, " Take
my_
upon You, and learn from me
(Matt: 11.28-29). To come
him includes taking his yoke upon us, being subject to his
direction and guidance; learning from him and being obedient to
him. If we are
unwilling
[0 make such
commitment; then we have
not truly placed our tnust in him_
When Scripture speaks of trusting in God 0r in Christ, it frequently
connects such trust with genuine repentance_
For example_
Isaiah
gives an eloquent testimony that is
typical of the message of many
of the Old Testament prophets:
Seek the LORD while he may be found,
call upon him while he is near;
let the wicked forsake his way;
and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
let him return t0 the LORD, that he may have mercy on
and [0 0uI God_
for he will abundantly pardon. (Isa. 55.6-7)

hin;
Here both repentance from sin and coming to God for pardon are mentioned_
the New Testament, Paul summarizes his gospel ministry as one of
"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God and of faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 20.21).
The author of Hebrews includes as the
first two elements in
list of elementary doctrines
repentance from dead
works
and "faith toward God" (Heb_
6.1).
Of course sometimes faith alone is named as the thing necessary for
coming to Christ for salvation (see John 3.16; Acts 16.31; Rom_
10.9; Eph 2.8-9,etal.) These are familiar passages and
emphasize them often when
explaining the gospel
others_
Buc
what we do not often realize is the fact that there are many other
passages where only repentance
named
tor it is simply assumed
that true repentance will also involve faith in Christ for forgiveness
of sins. The New Testament authors understood SO well thar
genuine repentance and genuine faith had t0 go together that they
often simply mentioned repentance alone with the understanding
that faith would also be included, because
from sins in a
genuine way is impossible apart from
genuine turning
God:
Therefore, just before Jesus ascended into heaven
he told his
disciples;
'Thus
is written; that the Christ should suffer and on
the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and
forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name t0 all nations"
(Luke 24.46
47) . Saving faith is implied in the phrase "forgiveness
of sins;
but it is not explicitly named
The preaching recorded in the book of Acts shows the same pattern.
After Peter'$ sermon at Pentecost; the crowd asked, "Brethren
whar
shall we do?" Peter replied, "Repent, and be baptized every one of
You in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins"
(Acts 2.37-38). €-In his second sermon Peter spoke to his hearers in
similar way; saying
Repent therefore, and turn again, that your
sins may be blotted out, that times of
refreshing may come from the
presence of the Lord" (Acts 3.19). Later; when the apostles were on
tria)
before the Sanhedrin;
Peter
of Christ, saying; "God
exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior; t0 give
repentance [0 Israel and
forgiveness of sins" (Acts 5.31). And when
Paul was preaching on the Areopagus in Athens to an assembly of
Greek philosophers, he said, "The times of ignorance God
overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere [0 repent
tuming
spoke
(Acts 17.30). He also says in his epistles_
Do you not know that
God's kindness is meant to lead yOu to repentance?" (Rom: 2.4),
and he speaks of
repentance that leads t0 salvation" (2 Cor:
7.10).
We also see that when Jesus encounters people personally he
requires them t0 turn from their sin before
come t0 follow him
Whether ict be
speaking to the rich young ruler and
that he
give up his possessions (Luke 18.18-30) , coming to the house of
Zacchaeus and declaring that salvation had come to him that day
because he had given half his
to the poor and had
fourfold
anything that he had stolen (Luke 19.1-10), speaking to
the woman at the well and
asking her to call her husband (John
4.16) , 01 speaking
Nicodemus and rebuking his rabbinic unbelief
and pride in his own
knowledge (John 3:1-21), Jesus consistently
puts his
finger on the area of sin most influential in that person $
life. In fact;
we may ask whether anyone in the gospels ever came
t0 sincere faith in Christ without
repenting of his or her sins.
When we realize that genuine saving faith must be accompanied by
genuine repentance for sin, it helps us to understand why some
preaching of the gospeL
has such inadequate results today If there is
no mention of the need for repentance, sometimes the gospel
message becomes only; "Believe
Jesus Christ and be saved"
without any mention of repentance at all:
But this watered-down
version of the gospel does not ask for
wholehearted commitment
Christ-
commitment to Christ; if genuine, must include
commitment t0 turn from sin_
Preaching the need for faith without
repentance i5
preaching only half of the gospel. It will result in
many people being deceived, thinking that they have heard the
Christian gospeE
and tried it; but nothing has happened: 'They might
pven
say
something like;
accepted Christ as Savior over and over
again and it never worked_
Yet they never really did receive Christ
as their Savior; for he comes to us in his majesty and invites US t0
receive him as he is
the one who deserves [0 be
and demands t0
absolute Lord of our lives as well.
Finally; what shall we say about the common practice of asking
people t0 pray t0 receive Christ as their personal Savior and Lord?
Since personal faith in Christ must involve an actual decision of the
will, it is often very helpful to express that decision in spoken
words_
and this could
naturally take the form of
prayer
they
asking '
guods
repaid
very
Christ in which we tell him of OuT SOTTow for sin; our' commitment
forsake it, and our decision actually t0 put our trust in him. Such
spoken prayer does not in itself save 4S_
but the attitude of heart
that
represents does constitute true conversion, and the decision
speak that prayer can often be the point at which
person truly
comes
faith in Christ:
Doth Faith
Continue Throughout Life
Although
have been considering initial faith and repentance as
the two aspects of conversion at the beginning of the Christian life,
it is important
realize that faith and repentance are not confined
the beginning of the Christian life: They are rather attitudes of
heart that continue throughout our lives as Christians. Jesus tells his
disciples tO pray daily;
And forgive US our sins as we also have
forgiven those who sin against us"
(Matt. 6.12, author
translation),
prayer
genuine
will certainly involve daily
SOITOw for sin and genuine repentance:
And the risen Christ says t0
the church
Laodicea
'Those whom
love,
reprove and chasten;
so be zealous and repent-
(Rev: 3.19; cf:
Cor: 7:10).
With regard to faith, Paul tells uS
So faith; hope, love abide, these
three; but the greatest of these is love'
Cor: 13.13). He certainly
means that these three abide throughout the course of this life; but
he probably also means that they abide for all eternity: if faith is
trusting God to provide all Our needs
then this attitude will never
cease
not even in the age t0 come:
But in any case; the point is
clearly made that faith continues throughout this life
Paul also
says, "The life
now live in the flesh
live by faith in the Son of
God, who loved me and
himself for me"
(Gal: 2.20).
Therefore; although it is tnue that initial saving faith and initial
repentanc
occur only once in our lives, and when they occur they
constitute true conversion, nonetheless
the heart attitudes of
repentance and faith only
begin
conversion. These same attitudes
should continue throughout the course of our Christian lives. Each
day there should be heartfelt repentance for sins that we have
committed_
and faith in Christ t0 provide for Our needs and t0
empower US t0 live the Christian life.
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Have YOu come t0 trust in Christ personally; or are YOu still at the point

of intellectual
knowledge and emotional approval of the facts of
salvation without having personally put YOur trust in Christ? If yOu have
not put your trust in Christ yet; what do you think it is that is making YOu
hesitate?
Did this chapter help you think of faith in Christ in more personal terms?
It sO_
how might that increase your Own level of faith? Do you think that
it might be easier for young children than for adults t0 think of trust in
Christ as trust in
real person who is alive today? Why or why not?
What does this tell you about the way Christian parents should teach
their children about Jesus?
If your
knowledge about God has increased through reading this book;
has your faith in God increased
with that knowledge? Why or why
not? If your
has not increased along with your knowledge, what can

In terms of human relationships; do you trust
person more when you do
not know that person very well or after you have come

come to know Jesus and the Holy Spirit
better?
Did you feel
sincere sorrow for sin when you first came to Christ? Can
you describe what it felt like? Did it lead YOu to

that did not include repentance? Do You
think it is possible for someone genuinely
tust in Christ for
forgiveness of sins without also sincerely repenting for sins? Do you
think that genuine repentance usually involves only
sincere
feeling of
sorrow for sin in general, Or does
involve genuine sorrow for specific
sins_
and turning from those specific sins?

Chapter 36
Justification (Right Legal Standing Before
God)
How and when do we gain right legal standing before God?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In the previous chapters we talked about the gospel call (in which
God calls us t0 trust in Christ for salvation), regeneration (in which
God imparts new spiritual life t0 uS), and conversion (in which we
respond
the gospeL
call in repentance for sin and faith in Christ
for salvation). But what about the guilt of our sin? The gospel call
invited us [0 tNust in Christ for
forgiveness of sins. Regeneration
made
possible for US tO respond to that invitation. In conversion
we did respond
trusting in Christ for forgiveness of sins Now the
next step in the process of applying redemption t0 us is that God
must respond
our faith and do what he promised, that is, actually
declare our sins to be forgiven: This must be
legal declaration
concerning our relationship to God s laws, stating that we are
completely forgiven and no longer liable to punishment.
A right understanding of justification
absolutely crucial to the
whole Christian faith: Once Martin Luther realized the truth of
justification by faith alone_
he became
Christian and overflowed
with the new-found joy of the gospel. The primary issue in the
Protestant Reformation was
dispute with the Roman Catholic
Church over justification:
we are to safeguard the truth of the
gospeba
for future generations
we must understand the truth of
justification.
Even today;
true view of justification is the
line between the biblical gospel of salvation by faith alone and all
false gospels of salvation based on good works.
When Paul gives an overview of the process by which God applies
salvation t0 US, he mentions justification explicitly: "Those whom
he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also
dividing
justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified" (Rom:
8.30). As we explained in
previous chapter; the word called here
refers to the effective calling of the gospel, which includes
regeneration and brings forth the response of repentance and faith
(or
conversion) on our part After effective calling and the response
that
initiates 0n our part; the next step in the application of
redemption is "justification
Here Paul mentions that this is
something that God himself does:
Those whom he called he also
justified
Moreover; Paul quite clearly teaches that this justification comes
after our faith and as God $ response [0 our faith_
He says that God
"justifies him who has faith in Jesus'
(Rom: 3.26) , and that
man
justified by faith apart from works of law'
(Rom. 3.28). He says,;
"Since we are justified by faith; we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom: 5.1). Moreover;
man
not
justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ" (Gal.
2.16).
Just what is justification? We may define it as follows: Justification
is an instantaneous legal act of God
which he (1) thinks 0f our
sins as
forgiven and Christ $ righteousness as belonging to US, and
(2) declares uS I0 be righteous in his sight
In explaining the elements of this definition
we will look first at
the second half of
the aspect of justification
which God
declares uS to be righteous in his sight:
The reason for
these items in reverse order is that the emphasis of the New
Testament in the use of the word justification and related terms is
on the second half of the definition_
the legal declaration by God:
But there are also passages that show that this declaration is based
on the fact that God fist thinks
righteousness as belonging t0 uS_
So both aspects must be treated,
pven
though the New Testament
terms for justification focus on the legal declaration by God
dnehnclanneinclude
Leal Dedaratiol
The use of the word justify in the Bible indicates that justification is
legal declaration by God. The verb justify in the New Testament
(Gk dikaioo) has
range of meanings
but
common sense is
"to declare righteous_
For example_
read, "When they heard
this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been
baptized with the baptism of John" (Luke 7:29). Of course the
treating
very
people and the tax collectors did not make God to be righteous
that would be impossible for anyone t0 do. Rather they declared
God to be righteous. This is also the sense of the term in passages
where the New Testament (alks about uS
declared righteous
by God (Rom 3.20,26, 28; 5.1; 8.30; 10.4,10; Gal. 2.16; 3.24).
sense
particularly evident;, tor example_
in Romans 4.5:
"And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the
ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness:
Here Paul cannor
mean that God
makes the
ungodly to be righteous'
(by changing
them internally and making them morally perfect), for then they
would have merit Or works of their Own to depend on. Rather; he
means that God declares the
ungodly to be righteous in his sight
not on the basis of their good works, but
response
their faith.
The idea that justification is
legal declaration is quite evident also
when justification is contrasted with condemnation_
Paul says,
shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who
justifies:
who is t0 condemn?" (Rom_
8.33-34).
condemn"
someone is tO declare that person
guilty The opposite of
condemnation is justification, which, in this context; must mean "tO
declare someone not guilty:
This is also evident from the fact that
God'$ act of
justifying
given as Paul $ answer t0 the possibility of
someone bringing an accusation OF
charge" against God'$ people:
such
declaration of
cannot stand in the face of God's
declaration of righteousness_
Some Old Testament examples of the word justify (Gk dikaioo in
the Septuagint; when translating the hiphil of tsadak; "to justify'
add support t0 this
understanding: For example;
we read of
judges
who "justify the righteous and condemn the wicked" (Deut: 25.1
NASB) Now in this case "justify" must mean "declare to be
righteous or nOt
guilty;" just as
condemn'
means
declare to be
guilty:
It would make no sense t0 say that "justify" here means "to
make someone t0 be
internally;
for judges simply do not and
cannot make people t0 be
on the inside: Nor does
judge
act
condemning
the wicked make that person to be evil on the
inside;
simply declares that the person is guilty with respect tO the
particular crime that has been brought before the court (cf: Ex:
23.7;
Kings 8.32;
Chron. 6.23). Similarly, Job refuses to say
that his comforters were right in what
said:
Far be it from me
that
should declare you right"
(Job 27:5 NASB, using the same
Hebrew and Greek terms for "justify"
The same idea is found in
being
This
"Who
Euilt

Proverbs: "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the
righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD
(Prov: 17.15).
Here the idea of legal declaration is especially strong: Certainly
would not be an abomination t0 the Lord if "justify" meant "to
make someone
righteous inside-
In thal case
to "justify
the wicked" would be
good thing in God'$ sight: But if
"justify" means
declare to be righteous,
then it is perfectly clear
why "he who justifies the wicked" is
an abomination t0 the LORD:
Similarly, Isaiah condemns those
'who justify the wicked for
bribe" (Isa. 5.23 NASB); again, "justify'
must mean
declare t0 be
righteous
(here used in the context of
legal declaration).
In this sense of
declare to be righteous'
declare to be not
guilty" Paul frequently uses the word to speak of God'$ justification
of us, his declaration that we, though
guilty sinners
are nonetheless
righteous in his sight It is important
emphasize that this legal
declaration in itself does nOt change our internal
nature 0r character
at all In this sense of "justify;
God issues
legal declaration about
This is why theologians have also said that justification is
forensic; where the word forensic means "having t0 do with
proceedings_
John Murray makes an important distinction between regeneration
and justification:
Regeneration is an act of God
uS; justification is a judgment of God
with respect to us. The distinction is like that of the distinction between
the act of
surgeon and the act of
judge. The surgeon, when he
removes an inward cancer; does
something
in VS_
That is nOt what
judge does
he gives
verdict
regarding our judicial status. If we are
innocent he declares accordingly
The purity of the gospel is bound up with the
recognition of this
distinction. If justification is confused with regeneration or
sanctification; then the door is opened for the perversion of the gospel
at its center: Justification is still the article of the standing or falling of
the Church:
UendeWecarno
Sizht
In God'$ legal declaration of justification
he specifically declares
that we are just in his sight: This declaration involves two aspects_
Bood
very
legal
First, it means that he declares that we have no penalty t0 pay for
sin,
including past; present; and future sins_
After _
long discussion
of justification by faith alone (Rom: 4:1-5.21), and
parenthetical
discussion on remaining sin in the Christian life_
Paul returns [0 his
main argument in the book of Romans and tells what
true of
those who have been justified by faith: "There
therefore nOw no
condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
(Rom: &.1). In this
sense those who are justified have nO penalty t0 pay for sin. This
means that we are not subject to any charge of
condemnation:
shall bring any charge against God 's elect? It
is God who justifies; who is to condemn?" (Rom: 8.33-34).
The idea of full
forgiveness of sins
prominent when Paul
discusses justification by faith alone in Romans
Paul quotes
David as pronouncing
blessing on one
[0 whom God reckons
righteousness apart from works_
He then recalls how David said,
"Blessed are those
whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are
covered; blessed is the man
whom the Lord will not reckon
his sin" (Rom 46
8). This justification therefore clearly involves
the
forgiveness of sins. David spoke similarly in Psalm 103:12, "As
far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our
transgressions from us
(cf: v 3).
But if God merely declared us to be forgiven from our past sins,
that would not solve our
problems entirely; for it would only make
morally neutral before God
We would be in the state that Adam
was in before he had done anything right or wrong in God s sight
he was not guilty before God_
but neither had he earned
record of
righteousness before God. This first aspect of justification, in which
God declares that 0ur sins are
forgiven, may be represented as in
figure 36.1, in which the minus signs represent sins On OUI account
that are completely forgiven in justification.

However; such
movement is not enough tO earn 4S favor with
God:
We must rather move trom
point of moral neutrality [0
point of
positive righteousness before God_
the
righteousness of
life of perfect obedience t0 him:
Our need may
therefore be represented as in figure 36.2, in which the plus signs
indicate

IMPUTATION OF CHRIST 5 RIGHTEOUSNESS TC

Fiuure 36.2
Therefore the second aspect of justification is that God must declare
not tO be merely neutral in his sight but actually [0 be rignteous
in his sight In
he must declare US tO have the merits of perfect
righteousness before him:
The Old Testament sometimes spoke of
God as giving such righteousness to his people even though they
had not earned
themselves. Isaiah says, "He has clothed me with
the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of
rignteousness
(Isa. 61.10)
But Paul speaks more specifically
about this
the New Testament
solution
OuI need fOr
righteousness, Paul tells us that "the righteousness of God has been
manifested apart from law; although the law and the prophets bear
witness t0 it, tne
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all who believe'
(Rom. 3.21-22). He says,
Abraham believed
God, and
was reckoned to him as righteousness
(Rom: 4.3;
quoting Gen. 15.6). This came about through the obedience of
Christ; for Paul says at the end of this extensive discussion of
justification by faith that "by one man'$ obedience many will be
made righteous
(Rom: 5.19)
The second aspect of God'$
declaration in justification_
then, is that we have the merits of
perfect righteousness before him:
having_
fact;
But questions arise: How can God declare that we have no penalty
pay for sin, and that we have the merits of perfect righteousness,
if we are in fact guilty sinners? HOw can God declare us to be not
guilty but righteous when in fact we are unrighteous? These
questions lead t0 Our next point:
Uean Mecham
LLu
Hme
(EhnereRichenMAIc
When we say that God imputes Christ $ righteousness tO us it
means that God thinks of Christ'$ righteousness as
belonging
to vS_
regards it as belonging to us. He
reckons" it to Our account: We
read,
Abraham believed God, and
was reckoned t0 him as
righteousness
(Rom: 4.3, quoting Gen: 15.6). Paul explains_
"To
one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the
ungodly; his
faith
reckoned as righteousness_
So also David pronounces
blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart
from works
(Rom: 4.6). In this way; Christ'$ righteousness became
ourS.
Paul says that we are those who received "the free gift of
righteousness'
(Rom. 5.17).
This is the third time in
studying the doctrines of Scripture that we
have encountered the idea of imputing
or righteousness t0
someone else. First, when Adam sinned, his guilt was imputed t0
us; God the Father viewed it as
belonging -
t0 S_
and therefore it did.
Second;
when Christ suffered and died for our sins, OUr sin was
imputed t0 Christ; God thought of it as
belonging
to him, and he
paid the penalty for it:
Now in the doctrine of justification we see
imputation for the third time. Christ $ righteousness is imputed to
uS, and therefore God thinks of it as belonging to US. It is not our
own
righteousness but Christ's righteousness that is freely given to
So Paul can say that God made Christ t0 be
our wisdom; our
righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
(1 Cor: 1.30).
And Paul says that his
is [0 be found in
Christ;
noL
having
righteousness of my OWn, based on law; but that which is through
faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on
(Phil. 3.9). Paul knows that the righteousness he has before God is
not
anything of his own doing; it is the righteousness of God that
comes through Jesus Christ (cf: Rom: 3.21-22).
It is essentiab
to the heart of the gospel to insist that God declares US
to be just Or righteous not on the basis of our actual condition of
guilt _
goal
taith"
righteousness or holiness, but rather on the basis of Christ $ perfect
righteousness, which he thinks of as belonging to us. This was the
heart of the difference between Protestantism and Roman
Catholicism at the Reformation. Protestantism since the time of
Martin Luther has insisted that justification does not change 4S
internally and it is not
declaration based
any way 0n any
goodness that we have in ourselves. If justification changed us
internally and then declared us to be righteous based on how good
actually were
then (1) we could never be declared perfectly
righteous in this life_
because there is
always sin that remains
0uI
lives
and (2) there would be no provision for
forgiveness of past
sins (committed before we were
changed internally), and therefore
could never have confidence that we are right before God_
We
would lose the confidence that Paul has when he says,
Therefore,
since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom: 5.1).
If we thought of justification as
based on
something that we are internally we
would never have the
confidence t0 say with Paul; "There is therefore nOw no
condemnation for those who
in Christ Jesus" (Rom: 8.1). We
have no assurance of forgiveness with God, no confidence
draw near t0 him

10.22). We would not be able t0 speak of

(Rom: 5.17), Or say that "the free gift of God is
eterna)
life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom: 6.23).
The traditiona)
Roman Catholic understanding of justification is
very different from this. The Roman Catholic Church understands
justification
something that changes US internally and makes uS
more holy within:
According
the
of the Council of
Trent; justification is 'sanctifying and renewing of the inner man:
In order for justification to begin_
one must first be baptized and
then (as an adult) continue t0 have faith: " The instrumental cause
of the first justification is the Sacrament of Baptism:
~But "the
justification of an adult is not possible without Faith:
As far as
the content of justifying faith is concerned_
the so-called fiducial
faith does not suffice.
What is demanded is
theological
dogmatic
faith (confessional faith) which consists in the firm acceptance of
the Divine truths of Revelation.
Thus baptism is the means by
which justification is first obtained, and then faith is necessary if an
adult
to receive
justification
continue in the state of
Ore
would
"the
teaching
justification.
Ott explains that "the so-called fiduciary faith" is not
enough
-meaning that the faith that simply trusts in Christ for
forgiveness of sins is not enough. It must be
faith that accepts the
content of the teaching of the Catholic Church; "theological or
dogmatic faith:
The Roman Catholic view may be said t0 understand justification
as based nOr on
imputed righteousness but on infused righteousness
-that is, righteousness that God actually puts into US and that
changes US internally and in terms 0f OuI actual moral character:
Then he gives uS varying measures of justification according to the
measure of
righteousness that has been infused or placed within uS_
The result of this Roman Catholic view of justification is that
people cannot be sure if they are in
state of grace'
where
experience God'$ complete acceptance and favor: The Catholic
Church teaches that people cannot be certain that
are in this
"state of grace
unless they receive
special revelation from God to
this effect: The Council of Trent declared
If one considers his Own weakness and his defective disposition
may well be fearful and anxious aS tO the state of grace_
nobody
knows with the
certainty of faith; which permits of no error; that he
has achieved the grace of God
To this statement Ott adds the comment;
The reason for the uncertainty of the state of grace lies in this_
thac
without
special revelation nobody can with certainty of faith know
whether or not he has fulfilled all the conditions which are necessary
for the
achieving of justification. The impossibility of the certainty of
faith,
however; by no means excludes
high mora
certainty
supported by the testimony of conscience
Moreover; since the Roman Catholic Church views justification as
including something that God does within US, it follows that people
can experience varying
degrees of justification_
We read, "The
degree of justifying grace is not identical in all the
and
grace
can be increased by good works
Ott explains how this Catholic
view differs from that of the Protestant Reformers:
As the
Reformers wrongly regarded justification as
merely external
imputation of Christ'$ justice _
they
obliged also to hold that
they
they
just"
Wele
justification
identical in all men. The Council of Trent; however;
declared that the measure of the grace of justification received
varies in the individual person who is justified, according to the
measure of God's free distribution and to the disposition and the co-
operation of the recipient himself:
Finally; the logicab
consequence of this view of justification is that
0uI eterna
life with God is not based on God'$ grace alone_
but
partially on our merit as well: "For the justified eternal life is both
gift of grace promised by God and
reward for his own
good works
and merits.
Salutary works are; at the same time; gifts of God
and meritorious acts of man:
To support this view of justification from Scripture_
Ott repeatedly
mingles passages from the New Testament that talk not only of
justification; but also of many other aspects of the Christian life,
such as
regeneration (which God works in us), sanctification (which
process in the Christian life and which of course does vary from
individua_
[O individual) , the possession and use of various spiritual
gifts in the Christian life (which differ from individual to
individual) and eternal reward (which also varies
according
t0 the
individual) . To classify all of these passages under the category of
"justification" only blurs the issue and ultimately makes
forgiveness of sins and right
standing before God
matter of
OUI own merit, nOC
free gift from God. Therefore, this blurring of
distinctions ultimately destroys the heart of the gospel.
That is what Martin Luther s0 clearly saw and that is what gave
such motivation [0 the Reformation: When the
news of the
gospeba
truly became the
news of totally free salvation
Jesus
Christ; then
spread like wildfire throughout the civilized world:
But this was simply
recovery of the original gospel, which
declares, "The wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom: 6.23), and insists that
"There is therefore nOW no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus
(Rom: &.1).

For no human

Rom 3.20), then
Paul goes on t0 explain that
since all have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God_
they are justified by his grace as
gift, through
the redemption which is in Christ Jesus'
(Rom
3.23-24). God's
grace
means his
unmerited favor:
Because we are completely
unable to earn favor with God, the only way we could be declared
righteous is if God freely provides salvation for us by grace, tOtally
apart from our work: Paul explains, "For by grace you have been
saved through faith; and this is not your own doing_
it is the
gift of
God
not because of works; lest any man should boast" (Eph 2.8
9; cf. Titus 3.7). Grace is clearly put in contrast tO works Or merit as
the reason why God is
to justify 4S.
God did not have any
obligation
impute OuF sin t0 Christ 0r t0 impute Christ' $
righteousness tO us; it was only because of his unmerited favor that
he did this_
In distinction from the Roman Catholic teaching that we are
justified by God'$ grace plus some merit of our own, as we make
ourselves fit t0 receive the grace of justification and as we grow in
this state of grace though Our good works, Luther and the other
Reformers insisted that justification comes by
alone, not by
grace plus some merit on OUI pait:
Gcll Jutiliat
Through Qur Faith
Chrix
When we began this chapter
noted that justification comes after
saving faith: Paul makes this sequence clear when he says_
We
have believed in Christ Jesus
in order to be
justified by faith in
Christ; and not by works
the Iaw; because by works of the law
shall no one be justified" (Gal. 2.16). Here Paul indicates that faith
comes first and it is for the purpose of
justified
He also says
that Christ is "to be received by faith" and that God "justifies him
who has faith in Jesus'
(Rom. 3.25,26). The entire chapter of
Romans
defense of the fact that we are justified by faith, not
by works, just as Abraham and David themselves were. Paul says_
"We are justified by faith
(Rom: 5.1).
Scripture never says that we are justified because of the inherent
goodness of our faith, as if our faith has merit before God
It never
allows us t0 think that our faith in itself earns favor with God:
Rather; Scripture says that we are justified "by means of" our faith,
understanding faith t0 be the instrument through which justification
Jaw,
willing
grace
being
is given to US, but nOt at all an activity that earns US merit Or favor
with God. Rather; we are justified solely because of the merits of
Christ $ work (Rom: 5.17-19).
But we may ask why God chose faith to be the attitude of heart by
which
would obtain justification
Why could God not have
decided
give justification to all those who sincerely show love?
Or who show
Or contentment? Or humility? Or wisdom? Why
did God choose faith as the means by which
receive
justification?
It is apparently because faith is the one attitude of heart that is the
exact opposite of depending on ourselves_
When we come [0 Christ
in faith we essentially say;
give up:
will not depend on myself
my Own
works any longer:
know thar
can never make
righteous before God. Therefore, Jesus,
trust YOu and
depend on You completely [0 give me
righteous standing before
God:
In this way; faith is the exact opposite of trusting in
ourselves, and therefore it is the attitude that perfectly fits salvation
that depends not at all on our own merit but entirely on God s free
gift of grace: Paul explains this when he says_
"That is why
depends on
in order that the promise may rest on grace and
be guaranteed to all his descendants'
(Rom 4.16). This is why the
Reformers from Martin Luther 0n were sO firm in their insistence
that justification comes not through faith plus some merit Or good
work on Our part; buL only through
alone: "For by grace you
have been saved through faith; and this-
~is not your Own
is the gift of God
because of works, lest any man should
boast" (Eph 2.8-9). Paul repeatedly says that
no human being will
be justified in his sight by works of law
(Rom 3.20); the same
idea is repeated in Galatians 2.16; 3.11; 5.4
But is this consistent with the epistle of James? What can James
mean when he says_
You see that _
man is justified by works and
not by faith alone
(James 2.24). Here
we muSt realize that James is
using the word justified in
different sense from the way Paul uses
it. In the beginning of this chapter we noted that the word justify has
range of
and that one significant sense Was
declare t0
be righteous,
but we should also notice that the Greek word
dikaioo can also mean
demonstrate Or show to be righteous
For
instance, Jesus said t0 the Pharisees
You are those who justify
joy ?
good
myself
faith,
faith
doing;
meanings;
yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts" (Luke 16.15)
The point here was not that the Pharisees went around making legal
declarations that they were
not guilty'
before God_
but rather that
were
always attempting to show others that they were
righteous by their outward deeds. Jesus knew that the truth was
otherwise:
But God knows
hearts'
(Luke 16.15) . Similarly;
the lawyer who put Jesus t0
test by
what he should do t0
inherit eternal life answered Jesus' first question well
But when
Jesus told him; "Do this_
and you will live,
he was not satisfied
Luke tells us, "But he, desiring to justify himself; said to Jesus
'And who is my neighbor?'
(Luke 10.28-29). Now he was not
give
legal
pronouncement about himself that he was
not guilty in God's sight; rather; he was desiring
'show himself
righteous
before others who were
listening; Other examples of the
word justify
meaning "show
be righteous
can be found in
Matthew 11:19; Luke 7.35; Romans 3.4
Our interpretation of James 2 depends not only on the fact that
"show to be righteous
is an
acceptable sense for the word justified,
but also on the consideration that this sense fits well in the context
of James
When James says; "Was not Abraham our father
justified by works
when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?"
21) he is referring t0 something
ater in Abraham $ life; the
of the sacrifice of Isaac; which occurred in Genesis 22. This is long
after the time recorded in Genesis 15.6 where Abraham believed
God "and he reckoned it t0 him as righteousness_
Yet this earlier
incident at the beginning of Abraham'
covenantal relationship with
God is the one that Paul quotes and repeatedly refers t0 in Romans
4.Paul is
about the time God justified Abraham once for all;,
reckoning righteousness to him as
result of his faith in God. But
James is
talking about something far later; after Abraham had
waited many years for the birth of Isaac_
and then after Isaac had
grown old enough t0 carry wood up the mountain for
sacrifice:
that point Abraham was
shown t0 be righteous'
by his works
and
in that sense James says that Abraham was "justified by works,
when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar" (James 2.21).
The
concern of James in this section also fits this
understanding_
James is concerned t0 show that mere intellectual
agreement with the gospel is
"faith" that is really no faith at all:
He is concerned t0 argue against those who say they have faith but
show no
change in their lives: He says, "Show me your faith apart
they

talking :
larger
from your works; and
by my works will show you my faith"
(James 2:18). "For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith
apart from works is dead" (James 2:26). James is simply saying
here that "faith" that has no results 0r
works'
is not real faith at
all; it is
dead" faith: He is not denying Paul's clear teaching that
justification (in the sense of
declaration of right legal standing
before God) is by faith alone apart from works of the
he is
simply affirming
different truth, namely; that "justification'
in the
sense of an outward showing that one is righteous only occurs as
we see
evidence in

life. To paraphrase, James is saying
that
person iS
shown to be righteous by his works, and not by his
faith alone_
This
something with which Paul also would
certainly agree (2 Cor: 13.5; Gal. 5.19-24).
The practical implications of the doctrine of justification by faith
alone are very
significant: First, this doctrine enables uS
otfer
genuine hope
unbelievers who know they could never make
themselves righteous before God:
salvation is
free gift to be

Second, this doctrine gives us confidence that God will never make

Of course_
we may continue t0 suffer the ordinary
consequences of sin (an alcoholic who quits drinking may still have
physical weakness for the rest of his or her life, and
thief who is
justified may still have
go t0 jail tO pay the penalty for his Or her
crime) Moreover; God may discipline US if we continue t0 act in
ways that are disobedient to him (see Heb. 12.5-11),
this out
of love and for our Own good. But God can never nor will ever take

Adoption
(Membership in God's Family)
What are benefits of being
member of God'$ family?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In regeneration God gives US new spiritual life within_
justification God gives US right legal standing before him.
But in
adoption God makes us members of his family Therefore, the
biblicaB
on adoption focuses much more on the personal
relationships that salvation gives us with God and with his people:
Acrinturakerdene
Adcntton
We may define adoption as follows: Adoption is an act of God
whereby he makes US members of his family:
John mentions adoption at the beginning of his gospel, where he
says,
"But t0 all who received him, who believed in his name; he
gave power to become children of God" (John 1:12). By contrast;
those who do not believe in Christ are not children of God or
adopted into his family, but are "children of wrath" (Eph. 2.3) and
sons of disobedience'
(Eph: 2.2; 5.6). Although those Jews who
rejected Christ tried t0 claim that God was their father (John 8.41),
Jesus told them; "If God were your Father; yOu would love me_
You are of your father the devil, and your will
to do your father $
desires
(John 8.42-44).
The New Testament epistles bear repeated testimony
the fact that
we are nw God's children in
sense, members of his
family. Paul says:
For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did
not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into
but you have
teaching
special
feal;
received the spirit of sonship:
When we CrY,
Abbal Father!" it is the
Spirit himself bearing witness
our spirit that we are children of
God, and if children, then heirs_
heirs of God and fellow heirs with
Christ; provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be
glorified with him
(Rom. 8.14-17)
But if we are God' s children_
then related t0 one another as
family members? Certainly s0_
In fact; this adoption into God $
family makes us partakers together in one family even with the
believing Jews of the Old Testament, for Paul says that we are
Abraham
children as well: "Not all are children of Abraham
because
are his descendants; but 'Through Isaac shall your
descendants be named.
This means that
is not the children of the
flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise
are reckoned as descendants
(Rom: 9.7-8). He further explains in
Galatians,
Now we; brethren_
like Isaac_
are children of promise
are not children of the slave but of the free woman'
(Gal:
4.28,31; cf:
Peter 3.6, where Peter sees believing women as
daughters of Sarah in the new covenant):
Paul explains that this status of adoption as God $ children was not
fully realized in the old covenant: He says that "before faith came_
we were confined under the law
the law was our custodian until
Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. But nOw that faith
has come
we are n0
longer under
custodian; for in Christ Jesus
YOU are all sons of God, through faith
(Gal. 3.23-26). This is not
t0 say that the Old Testament completely omitted talk of God as our
Father; for God did call himself the Father of the children of Israel
and called them his children in several places (Ps. 103.13; Isa.
43.6-7; Mal: 1.6; 2.10). But even though there was
consciousness
of God as Father t0 the people of Israel, the full benefits and
privileges of membership in God $ family; and the full realization
of that membership; did not come until Christ came and the Spirit
of the Son of God was poured into our hearts, bearing witness with
our spirit that we were God's children.
What evidence d0 we see in our lives that we are God's children?
Paul sees clear evidence in the fact that the
Spirit bears
witness
our hearts that we are God's children: "But when the
time had fully come_
God sent forth his Son, bom of woman, born
under the law, t0 redeem those who were under the
SO that we
might receive adoption as sons: And because YOu are sons, God has
with
they
Holy
Haw,
sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying;
Abbal Father!' So
through God you are no
longer
slave but a son, and if =
son then
an heir
(Gal. 44-7)
John s first
places much emphasis on our status as children
of God: "See what love the Father has given uS_
thac
should be
called children of God; and s0 we are_
Beloved, we are God' $
children now
(1 John 31-2; John frequently calls his readers
"children"
"little children'
Although Jesus does call us his "brothers" (Heb_
2.12 NIV) and he
is therefore in one sense our older brother in God s family (cf: Heb:
2.14), and can be called "the firstbom among many brethren'
(Rom: 8.29), he is nevertheless careful t0 make
clear distinction
between the way in which God is our heavenly Father and the way
which he relates [0 God the Father: He says
Mary Magdalene
"Tam ascending to my Father and your Father; t0 my God and your
God" (John 20.17), thus
clear distinction between the far
greater and eternal
sense in which God is his Father; and the sense
which God is our Father:
Although the New Testament says that we are now God's children
John
we should also note that there is another sense in
which
adoption is still future because we will not receive the
full benefits and
privileges of adoption until Christ returns and we
have new resurrection bodies:
Paul speaks of this later; fuller sense
of adoption when he says,
Not only the creation_
but
ourselves_
who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as
wait for
adoption as sons_
the redemption of our bodies"
(Rom: 8.23). Here
Paul sees the receiving of new resurrection bodies as the fulfillment
of our
privileges of adoption, so much s0 that he can refer t0 it as
our
adoption as sons
B. Adoption Follows Conversion and Is an Outcome of Saving Faith
We might initially think that we would become God $ children by
regeneration
since the
imagery of
"born
regeneration makes us think of children being born into
human
family.
But the New Testament never connects adoption with
regeneration: indeed
the idea of adoption
opposite to the idea of
being born into
tamily!
epistle
making
3.2),,
our
being
again"
Rather; the New Testament connects adoption with
faith, and
says that in response
our trusting in Christ, God has adopted uS
into his family. Paul says,
In Christ Jesus YOu are all sons of God,
through faith
(Gal. 3.23-26).
And John writes, "But t0 all who
received him; who believed in his name, he gave power to become
children of God" (John 1:12).
These [WO verses make it clear that
adoption follows conversion and is God's response t0 our faith.
One objection to this might be brought from Paul's statement;
"Because YOu are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our
hearts, crying;
Abba=
Father!
(Gal. 4.6). Someone might
understand this verse
mEal
that first God adopted uS as sons and
second he gave us the Holy Spirit to bring regeneration tO our
hearts. Bur
few verses earlier Paul had said that we have become
sons of God "through faith" (Gal. 3.26). Therefore Paul s statement
Galatians 4.6 is best understood not t0 refer t0 the giving of the
Holy Spirit in regeneration, but rather to an additional activity of
the Holy Spirit in which he begins to bear witness with our spirit
and t0 assure US that we are members of God s family. This work of
the Holy Spirit gives US assurance of our adoption, and it is in this
sense that Paul says
after we have become sons
God causes
his Holy Spirit within our hearts t0 cry;
Abbal Father! " (cf:
Rom
8.15-16).
Adopticn
:Distinct
Juxdicaticn
Although adoption is
privilege that comes to us at the time we
become Christians (John 1.12; Gal 3.26;
John %1-2),
nevertheless, it is _
privilege that is distinct from justification and
distinct from regeneration. In regeneration we are made spiritually
alive
able to relate to God in prayer and worship and able to hear
his Word with receptive hearts_
But it is possible that God could
have creatures who are spiritually alive and yet are not members of
his family and do not share the special privileges of family
members
angels_
for example, apparently fall into that category:-
Therefore, it would have been possible for God to decide t0 give uS
regeneration without the great privileges of adoption into his
family:
Moreover; God could have given us justification without the
privileges of adoption into his family; for he could have forgiven
our sins and given US right legal standing before him without
saving
thal ,
elL
us his children: It is important tO realize this because
helps us to recognize how great are our privileges in adoption
Regeneration has tO do with our spiritual life within. Justification
has t0 d with our
before God's law: But adoption has to
do with our relationship with God as our Father; and in adoption we
are given many of the greatest blessings that we will know for all
etemity When we begin t0 realize the excellence of these
and when we appreciate that God has no obligation to give uS any
of them; then we will be able t0 exclaim with the apostle John; "See
what love the Father has given US_
that we should be called children
of God; and S0 we are'
(1 John 31).
The Privdere
Adopticn
The benefits or privileges that accompany adoption are seen, first,
in the way God relates tO Us, and then also in the way we relate to
one another as brothers and sisters in God's family.
One of the greatest privileges of our adoption is being able to speak
God and relate t0 him as
good and loving Father: We are to
pray;
Our Father who art in heaven" (Matt: 6.9), and we are to
realize that we are
no longer slaves, but sons" (Gal. 4.7).
Therefore ,
we nOW relate
God not as
slave relates [0
slave
master; but as
child relates t0 his or her father: In
God gives
uS an internal witness from the Holy Spirit that causes uS
instinctively to call God our Father: "When we cry;
Abbal Father!'
it is the Spirit himself
witness with our spirit that we are
children of God" (Rom: 8.15-16). This relationship o God as our
Father is the foundation of many other blessings of the Christian
life_
and
becomes the primary Way in which we relate
God
Certainly it is true that God is our Creator; OUr judge, our Lord and
Master; Our teacher; Our provider and protector; and the one who by
his providential care sustains OUr existence: But the role that is most
intimate, and the role that conveys the highest
privileges of
fellowship with God for eternity; is his role as our heavenly Father:
The fact that God relates t0 us as Father shows very clearly that he
loves us (1 John 3.1), that he understands uS
father has
compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those
who fear him; for he knows how we are formed
he remembers that
we are dust" [Ps. 103.13-14
NIV]) , and that he takes care of our
needs ("For the Gentiles seek all these
and your heavenly
making
standing
blessings;
facl
bearing
things;
Father knows that you need them all,
Matt: 6.32). Moreover; in his
role as our Father; God gives US many good gifts: "If yOu then; who
are evil, know how t0 give good gifts to your children, how much
more will your Father who is in heaven give good things t0 those
who ask him!" (Matt: 7:11). He especially gives US the gift of the
Holy Spirit [0 comfort US and t0 empower 4S for ministry and for
the Christian life (Luke 11:13).
In fact; it is nOt only gifts in
this life that God gives
4S, but he also gives uS
great
inheritance in heaven, because we have become joint heirs with
Christ. Paul says, "You are no longer
slave
but
son, and if =
son
then an heir" (Gal. 4.7); we are in fact "heirs of God and fellow
heirs with Christ" (Rom. 8.17). As heirs we have the rights t0
great eternal "inheritance which is imperishable_
undefiled, and
unfading; kept in heaven for
Peter 1:4).
All the great
privileges and blessings
heaven are laid up for uS and put at our
disposal
because we are children ot the
members of the royal
family, princes and princesses who will reign with Christ over the
new heavens and new earth (Rev 2.26-27; 3.21). As
foreraste of
this
privilege, angels are even now sent to minister t0 US and
serve uS (Heb
1.14).
It is in the context of this relationship with God as our heavenly
Father that we are
understand the prayer that Jesus told his
disciples to pray daily; "Our Father who alt in heaven
forgive
uS our sins, as we also have
forgiven those who sin against us"
(Matt. 6.9-12, author
translation). This daily prayer for
forgiveness of sins is not
prayer that God would give US
justification
and
throughout our lives_
for justification is
one-time event that occurs immediately after we trust in Christ
with saving faith.
Rather; the prayer for forgiveness of sins each
prayer that God's fatherly relationship with us, which has
been disrupted by sin that displeased him_
be restored, and that he
relate t0
uS once
again as
Father who delights in his children
whom he loves. The prayer;
Forgive US our sins,
therefore
is one
in which we are
relating not to God as eternal
of the universe _
but to God as
Father: It is
prayer in which we wish to restore the
open fellowship with our Father that has been broken because of sin
(see also
John 1.9; 319-22).
The
privilege of
led by the
Spirit is also
benefit of
adoption. Paul indicates that this is
moral benefit whereby the
Holy Spirit puts in us desires t0
God and live according t0 his

"All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of

should "put tO death the deeds of the body" by means of the
Spirit working within them (v 13; note "for " at the
beginning of v
14). He sees the Holy Spirit as leading and guiding God'$ children
paths of obedience
God
Another
privilege of adoption into God'$ family; though we do not
always recognize it as
privilege, is the fact that God disciplines uS
as his children_
son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the
Lord, nor lose courage when you are punished by him_
For the Lord
disciplines him whom he loves, and chastises every son whom he
receives" (Heb. 12.5-6, quoting Prov. 3.11-12). The author of
Hebrews explains, "God is treating YOu as sons; for what son is
there whom his father does not discipline?
he disciplines us for
ouI
that we may share his holiness'
(Heb. 12.7, 10) . Just as
earthly children grow in obedience and righteousness when they are
disciplined properly by their earthly fathers_
SO we
grow in
righteousness and holiness when we are disciplined by our
heavenly Father:
Related to the fatherly discipline of God is the fact that; as children
of God and joint heirs with Christ; we have the privilege of sharing
both in his sufferings and in his subsequent glory Just as it was
'necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into
his glory" (Luke 24.26), so God gives us the privilege of
the same path that Christ walked, enduring sufferings in this life
that we may also receive great glory in the life t0 come: "if
children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ;
provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified
with him
(Rom 8.17).
In addition t0 these great
privileges that concern OUr relationship to
God and fellowship with him; we also have
privileges of adoption
that affect the way that we relate t0 each other and affect Our Own
personal conduct: Because we are God'$ children, our relationship
with each other is far deeper and more intimate than the
relationship that angels_
tOr example_
have
another; for we
are all members 0f one family. Many times the New [estament
refers
Christians aS "brothers'
and
sisters" in Christ (Rom: 1.13;
8.12;
Cor: 1.10; 6.8; James 1.2; Matt: 12.50-
Rom: 16.1;
Cor:
7.15; Philem. 1.2; James 2.15). In addition t0 this_
the many verses
Holy
"My
good;
walking
in which entire churches are referred t0 as "brothers'
should not be
understood to refer t0 the men in the congregation only; but are
rather generic references t0 the whole church; and, except where the
context explicitly indicates otherwise, should be taken to mean
"brothers and sisters in the Lord
The designation "brother" is SO
LOMUI
the epistles that it seems
be the predominant way in
which the New Testament authors refer t0 the other Christians [0
whom
are
This indicates the strong consciousness
had of the nature of the church as the family of God: In fact; Paul
tells Timothy t0 relate t0 the church at Ephesus_
and t0 the
individuals within the church; as he would relate [0 members of
large family: "Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you
would
fatner; treat younger men like brothers; older women like
mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity"
Tim: 5.1-2).
This concept of the church as God $ family should give 4S
nev
perspective on the work of the church; it is "family work;
and the
various members of the family never should compete with each
other or hinder one another in their efforts, but should encourage
one another and be thankful for whatever good or whatever
progress comes t0 any member of the family; for all are
contributing t the good of the family and the honor of God our
Father: In
just as members of an earthly family often have
times of joy and fellowship when they work together on
single
project;
s0 our times of working together
building up the church
ought to be times of great joy and fellowship with one another:
Moreover; just as members of an earthly family honor their parents
and fulfill the purpose of
family most when they eagerly welcome
any brothers or sisters who are newly adopted into that family, so
we ought to welcome new members of the family of Christ eagerly
and with love:
Another aspect of our membership in God' s family is that we, as
God'$ children, are t0 imitate our Father in heaven in all our
conduct. Paul says, "be imitators of God, as beloved children"
(Eph: 5.1).
Peter echoes this theme when he says_
As obedient
children_
do not be conformed to the passions of your former
ignorance, but as he who called you is holy; be
yourselves in
all your conduct; since
is written; 'You shall be holy, for
am
holy'
(1 Peter 1.14-16). Both
and Paul realize that it is
natural for children t0 imitate their earthly fathers. They appeal to
they
writing"
they
fact,

Peter
this natural sense thar children have in order (0 remind uS that we
are t0 imitate our heavenly Father
indeed, this should be
something we naturally want t0 do and
delight in. If God our Father
in heaven is holy; we should be holy as obedient children:
When we walk in paths of righteous conduct we honor our
heavenly Father and bring glory to him. When we act in
way that
pleasing to God, we are t0 do s0 that others
may see YOUI good
works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven'
(Matt: 5.16).
Paul encourages the
Philippians
maintain pure conduct before
unbelievers "that YOu may be blameless and innocent, children of
God without blemish in the midst of
crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world" (Phil.
2.15). Indeed,
consistent pattern of moral conduct is also evidence
that we are truly children of God. John says, "By this it may be seen
who are the children of God
and who are the children of the devil:
whoever does not do right
not of God_
nor he who does not love
his brother" ( 1 John 3.10).
QUESTIONS FOR
PERSONAL
APPLICATOR
Look back over the list of privileges that come with our adoption as
God s children.
Had you previously thought of these as automatically
yours because you had been born again? Can you describe what our
eternal
life would be like if we had regeneration and justification and
many of the other
privileges that come with salvation; but no adoption
into God s family? Now how do you feel about the fact that God has
adopted you into his family compared with the way you felt before
reading this chapter?
Has your relationship with your Own human family become better or
more difficult as
result of your
becoming _
Christian? If your
relationship with your earthly family has become more difficult; how
have you found Mark 10.29-30 to be tnue in your life as
Christian?
Sometimes people who have had
unloving
01 cruel
earthly fathers have
found that their background creates difficulty in their thinking about God
and relating to him as
heavenly Father: How can Hebrews 12.10,
Matthew 7.11
and Luke 11.13, which contrast sinful earthly fathers with
our
perfect Father in heaven, be of help in that situation? Might
Peter
1.18 be helpful in this situation as well? What can
person who has had
cruel
and unloving earthly father do [0 gain
better and better
appreciation of who God is and what kind of Father he is? Do YOu think
that any of the people who became Christians in the first century had
cruel
and
unloving fathers,
01 nO
living fathers at all? What teachings of
the Old Testament would have helped them at this point? Do you think
thac people who have had
earthly fathers have
God-given inward
sense of what
father would be like?
Think of the people who are members of your church
Has this chapter
helped you
think of them more as your brothers and sisters (0r if they
are
older; as those who are like "fathers
and
mothers" to you)? How do
you think an added appreciation of this idea of the church as
family
would be helpful to your church? How could you encourage
greater
appreciation of this idea?
Does your church have any sense of competition with other churches that
might be overcome by greater appreciation of the doctrine of adoption?
In the human family; when one of the children commits
crime and is
publicly punished for
the entire family suffers shame
On the other
hand
when
family member is honored for an
outstanding achievement,
the entire family is proud and rejoices. How does this analogy of events
human family make you feel about YOur own personal level of
holiness in life, and the way
reflects on the other members of your
spiritual family? How does
make you feel about the need for personal
holiness among your brothers and sisters
the church? Do you
personally have
strong inward desire t0 imitate your heavenly Father in
your conduct (Eph: 5.1;
Peter 1.14-16)?
Do you sense the Holy Spirit within you bearing witness with your spirit
that your are
child of God (Rom. 8.15-16; Gal. 46)? Can You describe
what that sense is like?
Do you sense any discrimination against Christians of other races 0r
other social 0r economic
positions? Can yOu understand how the
doctrine of adoption should obliterate such distinctions in the church (see
Gal. 3.26-28)? Can you also see how the doctrine of adoption means that
neither men nor women should think of the other sex as more important
or less important in the church (see Gal. 3.28)?

Sanctification
(Growth in Likeness to Christ)
How do we grow in Christian maturity?
What are the blessings of Christian growth?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The previous chapters have discussed several acts of God that occur
at the beginning of our Christian lives
the gospel call (which God
addresses to us), regeneration (by which God imparts new life to
us) , justification (by which God gives US right legal standing before
him), and adoption (in which God makes uS members of his
family) We have also discussed conversion (in which we repent of
sins and trust in Christ for salvation) These events all occur at the
beginning of our Christian lives
But nOw we come [0
part of the application of redemption that is
progressive work that continues throughout our earthly lives. It is
also
work in which God and man cooperate, each playing distinct
roles_
This part of the application of redemption is called
sanctification: Sanctification is
progressive work of God and man
that makes US more and more free from sin and like Christ in
actual lives.

for Paul talks
about the
washing of regeneration and renewal in the
Spirit" (Titus
3.5).
Once we have been bomn
we cannot continue t0 sin as

keeps uS from yielding [O
life of sin.
This initial moral change is the first stage in sanctification. In this
sense
there is some overlap between
regeneration and
sanctification, for this moral change is actually
part of
regeneration. But when we view
from the standpoint of morab
change within uS_
we can also see it as the first stage in
sanctification. Paul looks back on
completed event when he says
the Corinthians, "But YOu were washed, YOu were sanctified, you
were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit
of our God" (1 Cor: 6.11). Similarly, in Acts 20.32 Paul can refer t0
Christians as "all those who are sanctified_
This initial step in sanctification involves
definite break from the
ruling power and love of sin,
that the believer is no longer ruled
dominated by sin and no longer loves to sin. Paul says, "So you
also must consider yourselves dead t0 sin and alive to God in Christ
Jesus.
For sin will have no dominion over YOU
(Rom_
6.11, 14).
Paul says that Christians have been "set free from sin'
(Rom. 6.18).
In this context; to be dead [0 sin 0r [0 be set free from sin involves
the power to overcome acts or patterns
sinful behavior in one'$
life. Paul tells the Romans not t0 let sin "reign in your mortal
bodies_
and he also says, "Do not yield your members to sin as
instruments of wickedness; but yield yourselves to God" (Rom_
6.12-13). To be dead to the
power of sin means that we as

Christians, by virtue of the power of the
Spirit and the
resurection life of Christ working within US, have pOwer to
overcome
the temptations and enticements of sin. Sin will no longer
be our' master, aS once

In practical terms, this means that we must affirm Lwo things to be
true: On the one hand, we will never be able t0 say;

completely free from sin;
because OuF sanctification will never be
completed (see below)_
But on the other hand,

Testament speaks about.
definite beginning
sanctification, it also sees it as
process that continues throughout our Christian lives.
This is the primary
sense in which sanctification is used in systematic
theology and in Christian
conversation generally today:
Although Paul says that his readers have been
set free from sin (Rom: 6.18) and that they are
dead t0 sin and alive to God"
(Rom_

Paul says that throughout the Christian life "we all _
are being
changed into his likeness from one degree of glory
another" (2
Cor: 3.18). We are progressively becoming more and more like
Christ as we go on in the Christian life. Therefore he says_
"Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward tO what lies

God in Christ Jesus'
(Phil. 3.13-14)-this is in the context of
saying that he is not already perfect but he presses 0n to achieve all
of the purposes for which Christ has saved him (vv 9-12).
Paul tells the Colossians that
should not lie t0 one another;
since they have
on the new nature, which is being renewed in
knowledge after the image of its creator" (Col. 3.10), thus
that sanctification even involves increasing likeness t0 God in our
thoughts as well as our words and deeds. The author of Hebrews
tells his readers tO
lay aside every weight; and sin which clings so
closely'
(Heb: 12.1), and to
strive for
the holiness without
which no one will see the Lord" (Heb. 12.14). James encourages
hearers, "Be doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James
1.22), and Peter tells his readers, "Be holy yourselves in all your
conduct" (1 Peter 1.15).
It is not necessary t0 list multiple additional quotations_
because
much of the New Testament is taken up with instructing believers in
various churches on how they should grow in likeness to Chrisc_ AlI
of the moral exhortations and commands in the New Testament
epistles apply here;
because they all exhort believers t0 one aspect
another of greater sanctification in their lives. It is the

will increase throughout our Christian
3. Sanctification Is Completed at Death (for Our Souls) and When the
Lord Returns (for Our Bodies). Because there is sin that still remains in our
hearts even though we have become Christians (Rom. 6.12-13;
John 1.8),
our sanctification will never be completed in this life (see below). But once
we die and go to be with the Lord, then our sanctification is completed in one
sense, for our souls are set free ftrom
indwelling sin and are made perfect The

author of Hebrews says that when we come into the presence of God t0

is only appropriate because it is in anticipation of the fact that "nothing
unclean shall enter" into the presence of God, the heavenly city (Rev: 21.27)-
However; when we appreciate that sanctification involves the whole
person, including our bodies (see
Cor: 7:1;
Thess. 5.23), then
realize that sanctification will not be entirely completed until the
Lord returns and we receive new resurrection bodies:
We await the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
heaven, and he
will change
our lowly body to be like his
glorious body" (Phil. 3.21). It is "at
his coming"
(1 Cor: 15.23) that we will be made alive with
resurrection body and then we shall fully "bear the image of the
Man of heaven'
(1 Cor: 15.49).

Sanctification Is Never Completed in This Life:
There have always been
some in the history of the church who have taken commands such as Matthew
5.48
You; therefore, must be perfect; as your heavenly Father is perfect") 01
Corinthians 7:1 ("let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body
and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God"-
and reasoned that
since God gives uS these commands, he must also give US the ability t0
them perfectly. Therefore_
they have concluded, it is possible for US to attain
state of sinless perfection in this life. Moreover; they
Paul $ prayer for
the Thessalonians, "May the God of peace himself sanctify YOu wholly" (1
Thess. 5.23), and infer that Paul $ prayer may well have been fulfilled for
some of the Thessalonian Christians_
In fact; John even says_
No one who
abides in him sins'
John 3.6)! Do these verses not point t0 the possibility
of sinless perfection in the life
some Christians? In this discussion;
use the term perfectionism t0 refer t0 this view that sinless perfection
possible in this life.
On closer inspection, these passages do not support the perfectionist
position. FirSt; it is simply nOt taught in Scripture that when God
gives
command, he also gives the ability to
it in every case_
God commands all people everywhere
obey all ot his moral
laws and holds them accountable for failing t0
them, even
though unredeemed people are sinners and_
as such; dead in
trespasses and sins
and thus unable t0 obey God $ commands_
When Jesus commands US t0 be perfect as Our Father in heaven is
perfect (Matt. 5.48) , this simply shows that God'$ own absolute
moral purity is the standard toward which we are t0 aim and the
standard for which God holds us accountable: The fact that we are
unable to attain that standard does not mean that it will be lowered;
rather;
means that we need God'$ grace and forgiveness t0
overcome OuI remaining sin. Similarly; when Paul commands the
Corinthians to make holiness perfect in the fear of the Lord (2 Cor:
7.1), 0r prays that God would sanctify the Thessalonians wholly
Thess. 5.23), he is pointing
the
that he desires then

He does not imply that any reach it; but only that this is the high
moral standard toward which God wants all believers tO aspire:

does not teach that some
us attain perfection, because the

present-tense Greek verbs are better translated as indicating

This is similar 0 John $ starement
few
verses later;
No one who
bomn of God will continue t0 sin;
because God's seed remains in him; he cannot g0 on sinning_
because he has been born of God" (1 John 3.9 NIV) If these verses
were taken t0 prove sinless perfection_
would have to prove it
for all Christians, because they talk about what is true of everyone
born of God, and everyone who has seen Christ and known him:
Therefore, there do not seem to be any convincing verses in
Scripture that teach that it is possible for anyone to be completely
free of sin
this life:
On the other hand, there are passages in both
the Old and New Testaments that clearly teach that we cannot be
morally perfect in this life. In Solomon

life:
As we noted above
when Paul talks about the new power over sin
that is given [0
Christian, he does not say that there will be no sin
in the Christian 's life, but simply tells the believers not t0 let sin
"reign" in their bodies nor to "yield" their members tO sin (Rom:
6.12-13). He does not say that they will not sin, but says that sin
will not dominate or "have
dominion" over them (Rom. 6.14).
The very fact that he issues these directions shows his realization
that sin will continue to be present in the lives of believers
throughout their time on earth:

could say;

he also says clearly; "If we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth

(1 John 1.8). Here John
explicitly excludes the possibility of being completely free from sin
in our lives.
he says that anyone who claims to be free from
sin is simply deceiving himself; and the truth is not in him:-

God's Role in Sanctification_
Since sanctification is primarily
work of
God, it is appropriate that Paul prays,
May the God of peace himself sanctify
you wholly'
(1 Thess- 5.23). One specific role of God the Father in this
sanctification is his process of
disciplining
us as his children (see Heb_
12.5-
11). Paul tells the Philippians_
"God is at work in YOu; both to
and t0
work for his
pleasure"
(Phil 2.13) , thus indicating something of the way
in which God sanctifies them
both by causing them to want his will and by
giving them power t0 do it. The author of Hebrews speaks of the role of the
Father and the role of the Son in
familiar benediction:
may the God of
peace
yOu with everything
that yOu may do his will, working
in you that which is
pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; [0 whom be
glory for ever and ever" (Heb: 13.20-21).
The role of God the Son;
Jesus Christ, in sanctification is, first; that
he earned our sanctification for US _
Therefore Paul could say that
God made Christ t0 be
OuI wisdom; our righteousness and
sanctification and redemption
Cor: 1.30).
Moreover; in the
process of sanctification_
Jesus is also Our example , for we are to
run the race of life
"looking
Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of
faith" (Heb_
12.2). Peter tells his readers, "Christ also suffered
for yOu; leaving YOu an example, that yOu should follow in his
steps
(1 Peter 2.21).
And John says
"He who says he abides in
ought
walk in the same
way in which he walked"
John
2.6).
But it is specifically God the Holy Spirit who works within us to
change us and sanctify us, giving 4s greater holiness of life:
speaks of the
sanctification of the Spirit" (1 Peter 1:2 , author'$
translation), and Paul speaks of
'sanctification by the Spirit" (2
Thess. 2:13). It is the Holy Spirit who produces in uS the "fruit of
the Spirit" (Gal. 5.22-23) , those character traits that are part of
greater and greater sanctification. If we grow in sanctification we
walk by the Spirit" and are "led by the Spirit" (Gal. 5.16-18; cf:
Rom: &.14), that is_
we are more and more responsive

sanctification.
First, what may be called the
passive'
role that we play in
sanctification
seen in texts that encourage US t0 trust God 0r t0
pray and ask that he sanctify us. Paul tells his readers, "Yield
yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death t0
life"
(Rom. 6.13; cf: v 19), and he tells the Roman Christians,
"Present your bodies as
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable t0
God" (Rom: 12.1)_
Paul realizes that we are dependent on the
Spirit'$ work [0 grow
sanctification, because he says, "If by the
Spirit YOu put to death the deeds of the body you will live" (Rom:
8.13).
Unfortunately today, this
passive
role
sanctification, this idea
of yielding to God and trusting him t0 work in us "tO will and t0
work for his good pleasure'
(Phil. 2.13), is sometimes S0 strongly
emphasized that it is the only thing people are told about the
sanctification_
Sometimes the popular phrase "let go and let God" is
given as
summary of how t0 live the Christian life
But this is
tragic distortion of the doctrine of sanctification, for it only
speaks
of one half of the part
must play, and, by itself, will lead
Christians [0 become
and t0 neglect the active role that
Scripture commands them to play in their own sanctification.
That active role which we are
play is indicated by Romans &:13_
where Paul says; "If by the Spirit YOu put to death the deeds of the
body you will live_
Here Paul acknowledges that it is "by the
Spirit" that we are able t0 do this. But he also says we must do it! It
is not the Holy Spirit who is commanded to put to death the deeds
of the flesh; but Christians! Similarly, Paul tells the Philippians
"Therefore; my beloved_
as yOu have always obeyed
So nOw; not
only as
my presence buL much more in my absence, work OUI
your own salvation with fear and trembling_
for God is at work in
YOu; both t0 will and t0 work for his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:12
13). Paul encourages them t0 obey even more than they did when
he was present: He says that obedience is the way in which
work out [their] own salvation_
meaning that
will
work out"
the further realization of the benefits of salvation in their Christian
life -
The Philippians are

There are many aspects t0 this active role that we are t0 play in
sanctification: We are t0
Strive

no one will see the Lord" (Heb: 12.14); we are t0

and s0 obey the will of God, which is our
sanctification'
Thess
4.3). John says that those who hope [0 be
like Christ when he appears Will actively work at purification in this
life:
And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is
John 3.3) . Paul tells the Corinthians t0 "shun immorality"
Cor: 6.18) , and not to have partnership with unbelievers
Cor:
6.14). He then says, "Let us cleanse ourselves from every
defilement of body and spirit; and make holiness perfect in the fear
of God" (2 Cor: 7:1). This kind of striving for obedience t0 God and
for holiness may involve great effort 0n our part; for Peter tells his
readers [0
make every effort" to grow in character traits that
accord with godliness (2 Peter 1:5). Many specific passages of the
Testament encourage detailed attention tO various aspects of
holiness and
godliness
in life (see Rom: 12.1-13.14; Eph: 417_
6.20; Phil 44-9; Col. 35-4.6;
Peter 2:11-5.11; et al.) We are
continually to build up patterns and habits of holiness, for one
measure of maturity is that mature Christians "have their faculties
trained by practice to distinguish good from evil" (Heb: 5.14).
The New Testament does not suggest any short-cuts by which we
can grow in sanctification, but simply encourages US repeatedly t0
give ourselves t0 the old-fashioned_
time-honored means of Bible
reading and meditation (Ps. 1.2; Matt. 4.4; 17:17) . prayer (Eph
6.18; Phil 4.6) , worship (Eph. 5.18-20) , witnessing (Matt. 28.19 _
20), Christian fellowship (Heb. 10.24-25), and self-discipline or
self-control (Gal. 5.23; Titus 1.8).
It is important that we continue tO grow both in our passive trust in
God to sanctify us and in our active
striving for holiness and greater
obedience
our lives. If we neglect active striving
God
become passive; lazy Christians_
neglect the passive role
of trusting God and yielding to him; we become proud and overly
confident in ourselves. In either case , Our sanctification will be

Sanctificati
Alfect
Wholt
We see that sanctification affects Our intellect and our knowledge
when Paul says that We
have put 0n the new nature
which is being
renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator" (Col. 3.10). He
prays that the Philippians may see their love "abound more and
more, with knowledge and all discernment" (Phil. 1.9).
And he
urges the Roman Christians to be
transformed by the renewal of
your mind" (Rom: 12.2). Although our
knowledge of God is more
than intellectual knowledge
there is certainly an intellectual
component to it, and Paul says that this knowledge of God should
increasing throughout our lives:
life "worthy of the Lord,
fully pleasing
him" is one that is continually "increasing in the
obey;
good
Peter _
they
calling '
love,
BtEu
keep
knowledge of God" (Col: 1:10).
The sanctification of our intellects
will involve growth in wisdom and knowledge as we increasingly
"take every thought captive t0 obey Christ" (2 Cor: 10.5) and find
that our thoughts are more and more the thoughts that God himself
imparts
uS in his Word:
Moreover; growth in sanctification will affect our emotions.
We
see increasingly in our lives emotions such as
joy; peace
patience
(Gal: 5.22)
We will be able increasingly t0 obey Peter'$
command "to abstain from the passions of the flesh that wage
your soul" (1 Peter 2.11)
We will find ic
increasingly
tnue
that we d0 not "love the world or
in the world" (1 John
2.15), but that we, like our Savior; delight to do God's
In ever-
increasing measure we will become
obedient from the heart"
(Rom: 6.17), and
will
put away" the negative emotions
involved in "bitterness and wrath and
and clamor and
slander" (Eph: 4.31).
Moreover; sanctification will have an effect on Our will, our
decision-making faculty; because God is at work in uS_
"to will and
work for his
pleasure
(Phil. 2:13). As we grow in
sanctification, OUr will will be more and more conformed [0 the will
of our heavenly Father:
Sanctification will also affect 0ur spirit;, the nonphysical part of
beings. We are to "cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body
and spirit; and make holiness perfect in the fear f God" (2 Cor:
7:1), and Paul says that
concern about the affairs of the Lord
mean taking thought for "how to be holy in body and spirit" (1 Cor:
7.34):
Finally; sanctification affects our physical bodies
Paul says,
the God of peace himself sanctify YOu wholly; and may your spirit
and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of
Lord Jesus Christ"
Thess. 5.23). Moreover; Paul encourages
the Corinthians, "Let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of
body and spirit; and make holiness perfect in the fear of God" (2
Cor: 7:1; cf:
Cor: 7.34).
As we become more sanctified in our
bodies
our bodies become more and more useful servants of God
more and more responsive t0 the will of God and the desires of the
Holy Spirit (cf:
Cor: 9.27).

will recognize that they are the means by which the Holy Spirit

but are t0 be made useful and able t0 respond

Christians sometimes fail t0
recognize the wide range of motives
for obedience t0 God that are found in the New Testament: (1) It is
true that
desire t0 please God and express our love t0 him is a
very important motive for obeying him
Jesus says, "If you love
me_
you will keep my commandments" (John 14.15), and, "He who
has my commandments and keeps them; he
is who loves me'
(John 14.21; cf:
John 5.3). But many other motives are also given
[0 uS:
(2) the need to
clear conscience before God (Rom:
13.5;
Tim: 1.5, 19;
Tim.
133;
Peter 3.16); (3) the desire to be
vessel for noble use'
and have increased effectiveness in the work
of the kingdom (2 Tim: 2.20
(4) the desire to see unbelievers
come to Christ through observing our lives
Peter 3.1-2, 15-16);
(5) the desire to receive present blessings from God on our lives
and ministries
3.9-12); (6) the desire t0 avoid God $
displeasure and discipline on our lives (sometimes called "the fear
of God") (Acts 5.11; 9.31;
Cor: 5.11; 7:1; Eph: 4.30; Phil. 2.12;
Tim. 5.20; Heb: 12.3-H1;
Peter 1:17; 2.17; cf: the state of
unbelievers in Rom: 3.8); (7) the desire t0 seek greater heavenly
reward (Matt: 6.19-21; Luke 19.17-19;
Cor: %.12-15;
Cor: 5.9-
10);
the desire fOr .
deeper walk with God (Matt. 5.8; John
14.21;
John 1.6; 3.21-22; and, in the Old Testament; Ps. 66.18;
Isa. 59.2); (9) the desire that angels would glorify God for our
obedience (1 Tim. 5.21;
Peter 1:12); (10) the desire for peace
(Phil. 4.9) and joy (Heb. 12:1-2) in our lives_
and (11) the desire t0
do what God commands, simply because his commands are right;
and we delight in
what iS
right (Phil. 4.8; cf Ps. 40.8).

Peter
doing
sanctification brings great joy [0 4S.
The more we grow in likeness
Christ; the more we will personally experience the "joy" and
peace"
that are part of the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal: 5.22), and
the more we will draw near t0 the kind of life that we will have in
heaven:
Paul says that as we become more and more obedient to
God, "the return yOu ger
sanctification and its end, eternal life"
(Rom: 6.22). He realizes that this is the source of our true joy: "For
the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and
peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom: 14:17).
As we grow in
holiness we grow in conformity to the image of Christ; and more
and more of the beauty f his character is seen in our Own lives.
This is the
of perfect sanctification which we
and
for; and which will be ours when Christ returns_
And every one
who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure
John 3.3)
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Can yOu remember in your Own experience the definite
beginning to
sanctification that occurred when you became
Christian? Did you sense
clear break from the
power and love of sin in your life? Do you
really believe that yOu are even now dead to the ruling power and love of
sin in your life? How can this truth of the Christian life be of help to you
specific areas of your life where YOu still need to grow in
sanctification?
As you look back over the last few years of your Christian life, can yOu
see
pattern of definite growth in sanctification? What are some
that you used to delight in which no longer interest you? What are some
things that you used
have no interest
that now hold
interest for
you?
As you have grown tO greater maturity and holiness in the Christian life,
have you become more conscious of the weight of sin that remains in
your heart? If nOt; why has this not been so? Do you think that it would
be helpful if you had
greater consciousness of the sin that remains in
your own life?
you had this,
what difference would it make in your
Uwn
life?
would it affect your life if yOu thought more about the fact that the
Holy Spirit is continually at work in YOu t0 increase your sanctification?
In living the Christian life
have YOu maintained
balance between your
passive role and your active role in sanctification; 0r have YOu tended tO
emphasize one aspect over the other; and why? What might you do to
correct this imbalance; if there is one in your life?
Have YOu thought previously that sanctification affects your intellect and
goal
hope
long
ruling
things
great
How
the way you think? What areas of your intellect still need quite
bit of
growth in sanctification? With
to your emotions
in what areas do
you know that God still needs to work to bring about greater
sanctification? Are there areas or aspects of sanctification that need t0 be
improved with respect
your physical body and its obedience
God'$
purposes?
Are there areas where you have struggled for years t0 grow in
sanctification, but with no progress at all in your life? Has this chapter
helped you regain hope for progress in those areas? (For Christians who
have serious
discouragement over lack of progress in sanctification; it is
very important t0 talk personally to
pastor Or other mature Christian
about this situation, rather than
g0 on for
long period of time:)
Overall, has this chapter been an encouragement Or discouragement tO
you in your Christian life?

Take Time t0 Be Holy"
Take time to be holy; speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in him always, and feed on his Word:
Make friends of God's children; help those who are weak;
Forgetting
nothing his blessing to seek:
Take time to be holy; the world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone_
By looking t0 Jesus_
like him thou shalt
Thy friends in thy conduct his likeness shall see.
Keep
be;
Take time to be holy; let him be thy guide,
And run not before him, whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow, still follow thy Lord,
And
looking to Jesus, still trust in his Word
Take time to be holy; be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each motive beneath his control;
Thus led by his Spirit to fountains of
Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.

Chapter 39
Baptism in and Filling With the Holy Spirit
Should we seek a "baptism in the
Spirit" after conversion?
What does
mean
be filled with the Holy Spirit?
Systematic theology books have not traditionally included
chapter
on baptism in the Holy Spirit or
filling with the Holy Spirit as
of the study of the
order of salvation;
the study of the various
steps in which the benefits of salvation are applied to our lives:
But with the spread of Pentecostalism that began in 1901
the
widespread influence of the charismatic movement in the 1960's
and 1970'$, and the remarkable growth of Pentecostal and
charismatic
churches worldwide from 1970 t0 the present; the
question of
"baptism in the Holy Spirit" distinct from
regeneration has come into increasing prominence_
have put this
chapter at this point in Our study of the application of redemption
for two reasons: (1) A proper understanding of this question must
assume an
understanding of regeneration, adoption, and
sanctification, all of which have been discussed in previous
chapters. (2) All the previous chapters on the application of
redemption have discussed events that occur (0r in the case of
sanctification, that
begin) at the point at which
person becomes
Christian.
But this question concems an event that occurs either at
the point of conversion (according to one view) or sometime after
conversion
(according
another view) Moreover; people on both
sides of the question agree that some kind of second experience has
happened to many people after their conversion, and therefore one
very important question is how to understand this experience in the
light of Scripture and what scriptural categories properly apply to it
EAFL
ANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Traditiona
Pentecostal Understanding
The topic of this chapter has become important today because many
Christians say that they have experienced
"baptism in the Holy
Holy
pan
Spirit" that came after they became Christians and that brought
great blessing in their lives. They claim that prayer and Bible study
have become much more meaningful and effective_
that
have
discovered new joy in worship, and
often say that they have
received new spiritual gifts (especially, and most frequently, the gift
of speaking in tongues).
This traditional Pentecostal or charismatic position is supported
from Scripture
the following way:
Jesus' disciples were born-again believers
before the
Pentecost, perhaps during Jesus' life and ministry; but certainly by
the time that Jesus_
after his resurrection, "breathed on them; and
said t0 them; 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
(John 20.22).
(2) Jesus nevertheless commanded his disciples
nol t0
depart from
Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father" (Acts 1.4),
telling them, "Before many days YOu shall be baptized with the
Holy Spirit" (Acts 15). He told them; "You shall receive power
when the Holy Spirit has come upon
(Acts 1.8). The disciples
then obeyed Jesus' command and waited in Jenusalem for the Holy
Spirit to come upon them s0 that
would receive new
empowering for witness and ministry:
When the disciples had waited for ten days_
the day of Pentecost
came
tongues of fire rested above their heads_
And
were all
filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as
the Spirit gave them utterance'
(Acts 2.4). This clearly shows that
received
baptism in (0r with)
the Holy Spirit: Although the
disciples were born again long before Pentecost, at Pentecost they
received
"baptism with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 1.5 and 1:16 refer
t0 it this way) that was subsequent to conversion and resulted in
empowering for ministry as well as speaking
tongues_
Christians today, like the apostles, should ask Jesus for
"baptism in the Holy Spirit" and thus follow the pattern of the
disciples' lives.
If we receive this baptism in the Holy Spirit;
will result in much more pOwer for ministry for our own
just
as it did in the lives of the disciples
and will often (0r always_
according
some teachers}
result
speaking
tongues as well
they
they
long
day
you"
they
they
they
great
lives;
Support for this pattern
-in which people are first born again
and then later are baptized in the Holy Spirit-~is seen in several
other instances in the book of Acts_
It is seen, for example, in Acts
8, where the people of Samaria first became Christians when they
"believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of
God and the name of Jesus Christ" (Acts 8:12), but only later
received the Holy Spirit when the apostles Peter and John came
Jerusalem and prayed for them (Acts 8.14-17).
Another example is found in Acts 19, where Paul came and found
some disciples'
at Ephesus (Acts 19.1).
when Paul had laid
his hands upon them; the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke
with
tongues and prophesied" (Acts 19.6)
All of these examples (Acts 2, 8, sometimes 10, and
19) Z are cited
by Pentecostals in order t0 show that
"baptism in the Holy Spirir"
subsequent to conversion was
very common occurrence for New
Testament Christians_
Therefore,
reason; if it was common for
Christians in Acts t0 have this second experience sometime after
conversion, should
not be common for us today as well?
We can analyze this issue of the baptism in the Holy Spirit by
asking three questions_
What does the phrase "baptism in the
Holy Spirit" mean in the New Testament?
How should we
understand the
second experiences
that came [0
born-again
believers in the book of Acts? (3) Are there other biblical
expressions, such as
"filling with the Holy Spirit;
that are better
suited tO describe an empowering with the Holy Spirit that comes
after conversion?

baptize YOu with water for repentance; but he who is
ftom
But;
they
after me
mightier than
whose sandals

worthy
cany; he will baptize You with the
Spirit and with fire
Mark 1.8: "[have baptized yOu with water; but he will baptize YOu with
the Holy Spirit
Luke 316:
baptize YOu with water; but he who is mightier that
the thong of whose sandals
am not
worthy t0 untie; he will
baptize YOu with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
John 1.33:
who sent me [0 baptize with water said t0 me_
He on
whom you see the Spirit descend and remain; this
he who baptizes
with the Holy Spirit
It is hard to draw any conclusions from these four passages with
respect t0 what baptism with the Holy Spirit really is. We discover
that Jesus is the one who will carry out this baptism and he Will
baptize his followers_
But no further specification of this baptism is
given:
The next Iwo passages refer directly to Pentecost:
Acts 1.5: [Here Jesus says,] "John baptized with water; but before many
days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit
Acts 11:16: [Here Peter refers back t0 the same words of Jesus that
Were
quoted in the previous verse:
He says,]
remembered the word of
the Lord, how he said,
John baptized with water; but you shall be
baptized with the Holy Spirit
These two passages show us that whatever we may understand
baptism in the Holy Spirit to be_
certainly happened at the day of
Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2, when the
Spirit fell in great
power on the disciples and those with them; and they
in other
tongues; and about three thousand people were converted (Acts
2.14).
It is important t0 realize that all six of these verses use almost
exactly the same expression in Greek; with the only differences
being some variation
word order 0r verb tense t0 fit the sentence;
and with one example having the preposition understood rather than
expressed explicitly:

The only remaining reference in the New Testament is in the
Pauline epistles:
Corinthians 12.13 (NIV mg):
For we were all baptized in one Spirit

and we were
all given the one Spirit to drink
Now the question is whether
Corinthians 12.13 refers t0 the same
activity as these other six verses_
In many English translations it
appears to be different; for many translations are similar to the RSV;
which says_
For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body:
Those who support the Pentecostal view of baptism in the Holy
Spirit after conversion are quite eager to see this verse as referring
something other than baptism in the Holy Spirit; and they
frequently emphasize the difference that comes out in the English
translations. In all the other six verses_
Jesus is the one who
baptizes people and the
Spirit is the
element" (parallel to
water in physical baptism) in which or with which Jesus baptizes
people: But here in
Corinthians 12.13 (s0 the Pentecostal
explanation goes) we have something quite different
here the
person doing the baptizing
not Jesus but the Holy Spirit
Therefore, they say;
Corinthians 12.13 should nOt be taken into
account when we ask what the New Testament means by "baptism
in the Holy Spirit
This point is very important t0 the Pentecostal position_
because, if
we admic thar
Corinthians 12.13 refers
baptism in the Holy
Spirit; then it is
hard t0 maintain that it is an experience that
comes after conversion: In this verse Paul says that this baptism
in with by the Holy Spirit made us members of the body of Christ
~We were all baptized in one Spirit into one body
(1 Cor: 12.13
NIV mg)
But
this really is
"baptism in the Holy Spirit;
the
same as the event that was referred tO in the previous six verses_
then Paul is
saying that it happened to all the Corinthians when they

English translations, it really
Calom
be supported by an examination of the Greek text, for there
the expression is almost identical to the expressions we have seen
in the other six verses_
Paul says en heni pneumati
ebaptisthemen ("in one Spirit
we were baptized" )
Apart from
one small difference (he refers t0
one Spirit" rather than "the Holy
Spirit" )
all the other elements are the same: the verb is baptizo_
and the prepositional phrase contains the same words (en plus the
dative noun pneumati) If we translate this same Greek expression
"baptize in the Holy Spirit" (or "baptize with the Holy Spirit") in
the other six New Testament occurrences where we find it, then it
seems
only propel
that we translate it in the same
way in this
seventh occurence
And no matter how we translate; it seems hard
that the original readers would have seen this phrase as
referring
to the same thing as the other six verses, because for them
the words were the same:
But why have modern English translations translated this verse to
say; "By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body;
thus
giving

note that the NASB gives "in"

But this should nor be seen as

where the cloud and the sea are the

Corinthians 12.13 also refers t0
baptism "in'

Spirit; and is referring to the same
as the other six verses mentioned:
But this has
significant implication for us: it means that; as far a5
the apostle Paul was concerned, baptism in the
Spirit occurred

Holy Spirit and the result was that

body of Christ:
For we were all baptized in one Spirit into one

(1 Cor: 12:13 NIV mg) "Baptism

therefore
must refer t0 the activity of the Holy Spirit at the
beginning of the Christian life when he gives US new spiritual
life
(in regeneration) and cleanses Us and gives
clear break with the
power and love of sin (the initial stage of sanctification) In this
way "baptism in the
Spirit" refers to all that the Holy Spirit
does at the beginning of our Christian lives_
But this means that it
cannot refer t0 an experience after conversion; as the Pentecostal
interpretation would have it:
But how; then, do we understand the references t0 baptism in the
Holy Spirit in Acts 1.5 and 11.6, both of which refer to the day of
Pentecost? Were these not instances where the disciples,
having
previously been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, now experienced
new empowering from the Holy Spirit that enabled them to minister
effectively?
is true thar the disciples were
"born again
before Pentecost,
and in fact probably
before Jesus breathed on them and told
them
receive the
Spirit in John 20.22_
-Jesus had said,
"No one
come
me unless the Father who sent me draws him'
(John 6.44), but the disciples certainly had come t0 Jesus and had
followed him (even though their
understanding of who he was
increased gradually over time). Certainly when Peter said to Jesus_
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matt: 16.16) , it was
evidence of some kind of regenerating work of the
Spirit in
his heart_ Jesus told him;
and blood has not revealed this t0
YOu, but my Father who is in heaven'
(Matt:
16.17).
And Jesus had

disciples had "little faith
(Matt. 8.26) at times_
but
did have
faith! Certainly they were regenerated long before the day of
PenteCOst
But we must realize that the day of Pentecost is much more than an
individual event in the lives of Jesus' disciples and those with them:
The
of Pentecost was the point of transition between the old
covenant work and ministry of the
Spirit and the new
covenant work and ministry 0f the
Spirit. Of course the
Spirit was at work throughout the Old Testament; hovering over the
waters of the first
of creation (Gen: 1.2),
empowering people
for service t0 God and leadership and prophecy (Ex 31.3; 35.31;
Deut: 34.9; Judg
14.6;
Sam: 16.13; Ps_
51.11, et al.) But
that time the work of the Holy Spirit in individual lives was_
general,
work of lesse
power:
There are several
indications of
less powerful and less extensive
work of the Holy Spirit in the old covenant: the Holy Spirit only
came [0
few people with significant power for ministry (Num.
11.16-17, for example) , but Moses longed for the day when the
Holy Spirit would be poured out on all of God $ people: "Would
that all the LORD
people were prophets_
that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them!" (Num: 11.29). The equipping of the Holy
Spirit for special ministries could be
was in the life of
Saul (1 Sam: 16.14), and as David feared that it might be in his own
life (Ps. 51:11). In terms of spiritual power in the lives of the people
of God, there was little power over the dominion of Satan, resulting
in very little effective evangelism of the nations around Israel, and
examples of ability t0 cast out demons
The old covenant
work of the Holy Spirit was almost completely confined t0 the
nation of Israel, but in the new covenant there is created
new
"dwelling place of God" (Eph: 2.22), the church, which unites both
Gentiles and Jews in the body of Christ
Moreover; the Old Testament people of God looked forward t0
new covenant" age when the work of the Holy Spirit would be
much more powerful and much more widespread (Num. 1.29; Jer:
fron
they

Holy
Holy

lost;
31.31-33; Ezek: 36.26-27; Joel 2.28-29).
When the New Testament opens_
we see John the Baptist as the last
of the Old Testament prophets_
Jesus said,
Among those born of
women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he
who
least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
all the
prophets and the law prophesied until John; and if you are
accept it; he is Elijah who is t0 come'
(Matt_ 11.11-14). John
knew that he baptized with water; but Jesus would baptize with the
Holy Spirit (John 3.16). John the Baptist; then_
still was
in an
old covenant'
experience of the
of the
Spirit:
In the life of Jesus_
first see the new covenant pOwer of the
Spirit at work: The Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism
(Luke 3.21-22), and after his temptation Jesus
returned in the
JuwEI
of the Spirit into Galilee
(Luke 4.14). Then we begin t0 see
what this new covenant pOwer of the Holy Spirit will look like;
because Jesus casts out demons with
word
heals all who are
brought to him_
and teaches with authority that people had not
heard before (see Luke 416-44,
et al.)
The disciples; however; do not receive this full new covenant
empowering for ministry until the Day of Pentecost; for Jesus tells
them to wait in Jerusalem; and promises, "You shall receive power
when the Holy Spirit has come upon you" (Acts 1.8). This was
transition in the lives of the disciples as well (see John 7.39; 14.17;
16.7; Acts 2:16). The promise of Joel that the Holy Spirit would
come in new covenant fullness was fulfilled (Acts 2.16) as Jesus
returned t0 heaven and then was
given authority to pOur out the
Holy Spirit in new fullness and power (Acts 2.33).
What was the result in the lives of the disciples? These believers_
who had had an old-covenant less-powerful experience of the Holy
Spirit in their lives_
received on the Day of Pentecost
more-
powerful new-covenant experience of the Holy Spirit working in
their lives_
They received much greater "power" (Acts 1.8),
power for living the Christian life and for carrying out Christian
ministry.
This transition from an old covenant experience of the Holy Spirit
new covenant experience of the Holy Spirit can be seen in

gave the disciples more effectiveness in
their witness and their ministry (Acts 1.8; Eph: 4.8, 11-13), much
greater power for victory over the influence of sin in the lives of all
believers (note the emphasis on the power of Christ'$ resurrection at
work within us in Rom: 6.11-14; 813-14; Gal: 2.20; Phil. 3.10) ,
and power for victory over Satan and demonic forces that would
attack believers (2 Cor: 10.3-4; Eph: 1.19-21; 6.10-18;
John
4.4) This new covenant power of the Holy Spirit also resulted in
wide and hitherto unknown distribution of gifts for ministry tO all
believers (Acts 2.16-18;
Cor: 12.7, 11;
Peter 4.10; cf. Num
11:17,24-29). These gifts also had corporate implications because
were intended not o be used individualistically but for the
corporate
up of the body of Christ (1 Cor: 12.7; 14.12). It
also meant that the gospel was no longer effectively limited to the
Jews only; but that all races and all nations would hear the gospel in
power and would be united into the church; t0 the glory of God

(Eph 2.11-3.10).
Day of Pentecost was certainly
remarkable time of transition in the whole history of redemption as
recorded in Scripture_
It was
remarkable
in the history of the
world_
because on that
the Holy Spirit began to function among
God'$ people with new covenant power:
But this fact helps us understand what happened t0 the disciples at
Pentecost They received this remarkable new empowering from
the
Spirit because they were living at the time of the transition
between the old covenant work of the Holy Spirit and the new
covenant work of the Holy Spirit Though

time of transition in the work of the Holy Spirit: In their
case, believers with an old covenant empowering from the Holy
Spirit became believers with
new covenant empowering from the
Holy Spirit:
Bur we
today do not first become believers with a
weaker; old covenant work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts and wait
until some
ater time
receive
new covenant work of the Holy
Spirit: Rathel; we are in the same position as those who became
Christians
the church at Corinth: when we become Christians we
are all "baptized in one Spirit into one body
(1 Cor: 12.13)_just
as the Corinthians were
and just as were the new believers in many
churches who were converted when Paul traveled on his
missionary
journeys_
In conclusion, the disciples certainly did experience
baptism in
the Holy Spirit" after conversion on the Day of Pentecost; but this
happened because they were living at -
unique point in history; and
this event
their lives is therefore not
pattern that we are t0 seek
imitate.
What shall we say about the phrase "baptism in the Holy Spirit" ? It
phrase that the New Testament authors use to speak of coming
into the new covenant power of the Holy Spirit: It happened at
Pentecost for the disciples; but it happened at conversion for the
Corinthians and for uS.
It is not
phrase the New Testament authors would use to speak of
any post-conversion experience of empowering by the Holy Spirit:
C.How Should We Understand the *Second Experiences" in Acts?
The
day
day
Holy
Iong
But even if we have correctly understood the experience of the
disciples at Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2, are there not other
examples of people who had
second experience
of empowering
of the Holy Spirit after conversion; such as those in Acts 8 (at
Samaria), Acts 10 (Comelius' household), and Acts 19 (the
Ephesian disciples)?
These are not really
convincing examples to prove the Pentecostal
doctrine of baptism in the Holy Spirit either: FirSt, the expression
"baptism in the Holy Spirit" is not ordinarily used t0 refer t0 any of
these events
and this should give us some hesitation in applying
this phrase t0 them
But more importantly;
closer look at each
case shows more clearly what was happening
these events
In Acts 8.4-25 the Samaritan people "believed Philip as he
preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ" and
they were baptized, both men and women" (Acts
8.12) . Some have argued that this was not genuine saving faith on
the
of the Samaritans_
However; there is no indication in the
text that Philip had
deficient
understanding of the gospel (he had
been prominent in the Jerusalem church) or that Philip himself
thought that their faith in Christ was inadequate, for he allowed
them to be baptized (Acts 8.12).
better
understanding of this event would be that God, in his
providence, sovereignly waited to give the new covenant
empowering of the Holy Spirit t0 the Samaritans directly through
the hands of the apostles (Acts 8.14-17)
so that it might be
evident to the highest leadership in the Jerusalem church that the
Samaritans were not second-class citizens bur full members of the
church: This was important because of the historical animosity
between Jews and Samaritans
Jews have no dealings with
Samaritans
John 4.9), and because Jesus had specified that the
spread of the gospel to Samaria would be the next major step after
it had been preached
Jerusalem and the region of Judea that
surrounded Jerusalem:
You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and
in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1.8).
Thus, the event in Acts
was
kind of "Samaritan Pentecost;-
special outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the people of Samaria; who
Were
mixed race of Jewish and Gentile ancestry, SO that it might
be evident t0 all that the full new covenant
and power of
patt
blessings
the Holy Spirit had come t0 this group of people as
well, and were
not confined t0 Jews only Because this is_
special event in the
history of redemption; as the pattern of Acts 1.8 is worked out in
the book of Acts
it is not
pattern for uS t0 repeat today: It is
simply part of the transition between the old covenant experience of
the Holy Spirit and the new
Luvenall
experience of the Holy Spirit:
The situation in Acts 10 is less complicated, because it is not even
clear that Cornelius was
genuine believer before Peter
came and
preached the gospel
him. Certainly he had not trusted in Christ
for salvation. He
rather
Gentile who was one of the first
examples of the way in which the gospel
would go "to the end of

(Acts 1.8).
Certainly Cornelius had not first believed
in Christ'$ death and resurrection t0 save him and then later come
into
second experience after his conversion.
In Acts 19
once
we encounter
situation of some
people
who had not really heard the gospel of salvation through Christ.
They had been baptized into the baptism of John the Baptist (Acts
19.3) , so they were probably people who had heard John the Baptist
preach; or had talked t0 others who had heard John the Baptist
preach; and had been baptized "into John's baptism" (Acts 19.3) as
sign that they

Messiah who was

death and resurrection
had not even heard that there was
Holy Spirit (Acts 19.2)!-
fact that no one who was present at
Pentecost Or who had heard the gospel after Pentecost could have

know: It is likely that they had not even heard that Jesus
had come and lived and died
because Paul had to explain to them,
"John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to
believe in the one who
was t0 come alter him; that is, Jesus
(Acts
19.4). Therefore these "disciples" in Ephesus did not have new
covenant
understanding or new covenant faith
and
certainly
did not have
new covenant empowering of the Holy Spirit
they
were
disciples'
only in the sense of followers of John the Baptist
who were still
for the Messiah: When they heard of him
they believed in him, and then received the power of the Holy Spirit
that was appropriate t0 the gospel of the risen Lord Jesus Christ
Because of this
these disciples at Ephesus are certainly not _

It seems therefore that there are no New Testament texts that
encourage uS t0 seek for
second experience of "baptism in the
Holy Spirit" that comes after conversion_

The previous sections have argued that "baptism in the Holy Spirit"
is not the term the New Testament authors would use t0 speak of
post-conversion work of the Spirit;, and that the examples of
second experiences" of receiving the Holy Spirit in the book of
Acts are not patterns for uS tO imitate in our Christian lives.
But the
question remains
"What is actually happening
the millions of
people who claim that they have received this
'baptism in the Holy
Spirit' and that
has brought much
t0 their lives? Could
be that this has been
genuine work of the Holy Spirit but that the
biblical categories and biblical examples used to illustrate
have
been incorrect? Might it be that there are other biblical expressions
and biblical
that point to this kind of work of the Holy
Spirit after conversion and help us understand
more accurately?"
think there are _
but before we look at these, it is appropriate [0
comment on the importance of having
correct understanding at
this point:
Harm Comes to the Church From Teaching Two-Class Christianity At
various times in the history of the church Christians have attempted to divide
the church into Lwo categories of believers_
This is in effect what happens
with the Pentecostal doctrine of baptism in the Holy Spirit: It might be
pictured as in figure 39.2, which shows the world divided into Christians and
non-Christians
and then shows Christians divided into LWo categories_
ordinary believers and Spirit-baptized believers:
But such
division of Christians into tWO categories is not
unique
understanding that is found only in Pentecosta]
in the
twentieth century In fact; much Pentecostal
teaching =
came OuC of
earlier holiness groups that had taught that Christians could either
be ordinary believers or
sanctified" believers_
Other groups have
divided Christians
different
categories, such as ordinary
blessing
[eachings
teaching
using
believers and those who are
Spirit filled;
ordinary believers
and those who are "disciples,
carnal" and "spiritual"
Christians. In fact, the Roman Catholic Church has long had not
two but three categories: ordinary believers, priests, and saints.
All
of these divisions into different categories of Christians can be seen
figure 39.3.

Fiuure 39.F
Although those who teach the classical Pentecostal view of baptism
the Holy Spirit may deny that they are attempting to divide
Christians into [WO
categories
such
division
implicit every time
ask whether someone has been baptized in the Holy Spirit Or
not: Such
question strongly suggests that there are two groups of
they
Christians; those who have had this experience of "baptism in the
Holy Spirit" and those who have nOt:
What is the problem with viewing Christians as
in [WO
categories like this? The problem is that it contributes to
they'
mentality in churches, and leads to jealousy; pride; and
divisiveness. No matter how much these
who have received
this
empowering of the Holy Spirit try to be thoughtful and
considerate of those who have nOt; if they genuinely love their
fellow brothers and sisters in Christ; and if this has been
helpful experience
their own Christian lives
cannot help but
give the impression that
would like others t0 share this
experience aS well. Even if they are not proud in their hearts (and it
seems t0 me thar most are nOL) with respect t0 this experience, such
conviction that there is
second category of Christians will
inevitably give an impression of
spiritua)
superiority Yet
there
very likely be
sense 0f jealousy on the
of those who
have not had such an experience. In this way;
view of IWO groups
within the church
fostered, and the repeated
divisiveness that is made against the charismatic movement is given
some credibility In fact, divisions often do occur in churches_
The major objection t0 this position is that the New Testament itself
teaches no such [WO-level
two-class Christianity Nowhere in the
Epistles do we read of Paul or
telling
church that is having
problems
"You all need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit
Nowhere do we hear of the risen Lord Jesus speaking to the
troubled and weak churches in Revelation 2-3,"Ask me to baptize
You in the Holy Spirit
It is hard t0 avoid the conclusion that the
[WO-level
or two-class view taught by all of these groups
throughout history does not have
solid foundation in the
Testament itself:

we can place believers and divide them into set groups. Rather;
there are Christians at all points along
scale of increasing
Christian maturity (sanctification) , increasing
loseness of
fellowship in their walk with God (an aspect of adoption), and
greater experiences of the power of the Holy Spirit at work in their
lives and ministries_
The Christian life should be one of growth in all of these areas as
progress throughout life. For many people that growth will be
gradual
and progressive
and will extend over all the years of their
lives
We could represent it by the arow in figure 39.5.

How Should We Understand Contemporary Experience? What then has
happened to people who say
have experienced
"baptism in the Holy
Spirit" that has brought great blessing to their lives? We must understand first
what is commonly taught about the need t prepare for baptism in the Holy
Spirit:
often people will be taught that they should confess all known
sins_
repent of any remaining sin in their lives, trust Christ to forgive those
sins, commit every area of their lives tO the Lord $ service, yield themselves
fully to him; and believe that Christ is
going
empower them in
new way
and equip them with new gifts for ministry:
Then after that preparation_
are
encouraged to ask Jesus in prayer to baptize them in the Holy Spirit: But
what does this preparation do? It is
guaranteed prescription for significant
growth in the Christian life! Such confession, repentance, renewed
commitment; and heightened faith and expectation; if
genuine_
can
only bring positive results in a person's life
If any Christian is sincere
these steps of preparation t0 receive baptism in the Holy Spirit, there will
certainly be growth in sanctification and deeper fellowship with God. In

figure 39.6 and has made one very

Of course prayer and Bible study and worship will seem more
meaningful. Of course there will be more fruitfulness in
evangelism
and other kinds of ministry: But it is important tO recognize that
someone Who moves from
A to point B on the chart is not

who have been "baptized in the Holy Spirit" and who are therefore
different from those who have not had such an experience_
There
might be another Christian in the same church who has never had
such

years of his or her Christian life
and has come t0 point C on the chart above: Though that person has
never had

"baptism in the

he 0r she is still much farther

Before we leave this chart; one more observation should be made:
in many cases the charismatic movement has brought teaching on
the baptism of the Holy Spirit into more liberal churches where, for
many years
there has not been
clear proclamation of the gospel of
salvation by faith in Christ alone, and where people have not been
taught that they can believe the Bible completely as God's Word to

Suddenly, reading the Bible has become

Ic is no wonder that
the charismatic renewal has brought such excitement (and often
much controversy) t0 many Roman Catholic parishes and t0 many
mainline, more liberal Protestant denominations. Though we may
differ with the way this
actually presented_
nO one
should fault the good results that have come about as
result of it in
these churches:
What Terms Should We Use Today? Now we can understand
our
use
(erms
describe this experience and the category of understanding
put it in are S0 important: If we use the traditional Pentecostal terminology of
"baptism of the Holy Spirit;
then we almost inevitably end up with twO-
category Christianity, for this is seen as
common
experience that can and
indeed should happen to Christians at one point in time, and, once it has
happened, does not need to be repeated. It is seen as
singl
experience of
empowering for ministry that is distinct from the experience of becoming
Christian, and people either have received that experience or they have nOt:
Especially when the experience is described in terms of what happened to the
disciples at Pentecost in Acts
(which was clearly
one-time
experience for
them) , the Samaritans in Acts 8, and the Ephesian disciples in Acts 19, it is
clearly implied that this is
one-time event that empowers people for ministry
but that also puts them in
separate category
group than the one
were
in before this experience.
The use of the term
the baptism in the Holy Spirit"
inevitably implies Lwo groups of Christians
But
are correct in
understanding the experience that has come
to millions of people in the charismatic renewal as
step of
growth
their Christian lives, then some other term than "baptism
in the Holy Spirit" would seem to be more appropriate. There might
be several
terms that we could use
allow for
repetition, varying degrees of intensity, and further development
beyond that one experience
and so long as they do not suggest that
all truly obedient Christians should have the same experience_
We have already used one expression; "a large step of growth in
several aspects of the Christian life:

longer period of time but reach the same point in the Christian life_
Another term that may be helpful is
new empowering
ministry:
It is certainly true that many Who have received such
charismatic experience do find new power for ministry in their
Christian lives
including the ability to use spiritual gifts that had
been theirs before_
However; the problem
this phrase is
that it does not say anything about the deepened fellowship with
God, the greater effectiveness in prayer and Bible study; and the
new joy in worship that often also result from this experience_
What Is "Being Filled With the Spirit"? Yet an even more commonly
used term in the New Testament is
being filled with the Holy Spirit
Because of its frequent use in contexts that speak of Christian growth and
ministry; this seems I0 me t0 be the best term tO use t0 describe genuine
second experiences" today (or third or fourth experiences_
etc:) Paul tells the
Ephesians_
"Do not get drunk with wine_
for that is debauchery; but be filled
with the Spirit'
(Eph: 5.18). He uses
present tense imperative verb that
could more explicitly be translated, "Be continually being filled with the
Spirit;
thus
implying that this is
something that should repeatedly be
happening
Christians_
Such fullness of the Holy Spirit will result in
renewed worship and thanksgiving (Eph. 5.19-20), and in renewed
relationships tO others; especially those in authority over US 0r those under our
authority (Eph:
5.21-
6.9). In addition, since the Holy Spirit is the Spirit who
sanctifies US _
such
often result
increased sanctification:
Furthermore, since the
Spirit is the one who empowers us for Christian
service and gives 4S spiritual gifts, such
will often result in increased
power for ministry and increased effectiveness and perhaps diversity in the
use of spiritual gifts
We see examples of repeated
with the Holy Spirit in the book
of Acts. In Acts 2.4, the disciples and those with them were "all

Later; when

the Sanhedrin, we read_
"Then Peter; filled with the Holy Spirit; said

apostles had retumed [0 the church to tell what had happened (Acts
4.23)

Peter had been filled with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2.4)
and had later been filled with the Holy Spirit before speaking to the
Sanhedrin (Acts 4.8), he was once again filled with the Holy Spirit
after the group of Christians he was meeting with had prayed:
Therefore, it is appropriate t0 understand
filling with the
Spirit not as
-time event but as an event thal can occur over
and over
Christian
life. It may involve
momentary
empowering for
specific ministry (such as apparently happened in
Acts 4.8; 7.55), but it may also refer t0
term characteristic of
person
life (see Acts 6.3; 11:24) . In either case such filling can
occur many times in
person's life: even though Stephen_
as an
early deacon (0r apostolic assistant), was
man "full of the Spirit
and of wisdom
(Acts 6.3,
5) , when he was being stoned he
apparently received
fresh new filling of the Holy Spirit in great
power (Acts 7.55).

baptism in the Holy
Spirit" could easily be avoided by using any of the alternative

such as "being filled with the Holy Spirit" instead.
Moreover; many people who have had no single dramatic
experience (such as what Pentecostals have called
baptism in the
Holy Spirit) have nonetheless begun
experience new freedom
and joy in worship (often with the advent of modern worship or
songs in their churches), and t0 use
wider variety of
spiritual gifts with effectiveness and edification for themselves and
their churches (including gifts such as healing; prophecy; working
of miracles, discernment of spirits, and the ability t0 exercise
authority over demonic forces with prayer and
word of rebuke
spoken directly to the evil spirits). Sometimes the gift of speaking
in tongues and the gift of interpretation have been used as well, but
in other cases
have not: All of this is tO say that the differences
between Pentecostals and charismatics on the one hand
and more
traditionab
and mainstream
evangelical Christians on the other
hand, seem t0 me t0 be breaking down more and more,
and there
are fewer and fewer differences between them:

baptism in the
Spirit that catapults people into
new level of power in ministry and effectiveness in use of spiritual
gifts. Since this experience has been so helpful in the lives of
millions of people, should

quickly dismiss it? In response; it
must be said that; if the terminology "baptism in the Holy Spirit"
changed for something more representative of New Testament
teaching; there should be no objection at all to people coming into
churches, and t0 encouraging people t0 prepare their hearts for
spiritual
renewal by sincere repentance and renewed commitment [0

3. Being Filled With the Holy Spirit Does Not Always Result in Speaking
Tongues_
One remaining point needs to be made with respect to the
experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit: Because there were several
cases in Acts where people received the new covenant power of the Holy
Spirit and began
speak with tongues at the
time (Acts 2.4; 10.46;
19.6; probably also implied in 8.17-19 because of the parallel with the
experience of the disciples in Acts 2), Pentecostal
has commonly
maintained that the outward sign of baptism in the Holy Spirit is speaking in
tongues (that is, speaking in languages that are not understood by and have
not been
earned by the person
speaking; whether known human languages Or
other kinds of
angelic or heavenly or miraculously given languages).
But it is important to realize that there are many
cases
where
filled with the Holy Spirit did not result in speaking in tongues
When Jesus was filled with the Spirit in Luke 413
the result was
strength [0 overcome the
temptations of Satan in the wilderness_
When the temptations were ended_
and Jesus
returned in the power
of the Spirit into Galilee
(Luke 4.14), the results were miracles of
healing; casting out of demons, and teaching with authority. When
Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, she
word of
blessing to Mary (Luke 1:41-45). When Zechariah was filled with
the Holy Spirit; he prophesied (Luke 1:67-79). Other results of
filled with the Holy Spirit were powerful preaching of the
gospel (Acts 4.31), (perhaps) wisdom and Christian maturity and
sound judgment (Acts
powerful preaching and testimony
on trial (Acts 4.8),
vision of heaven (Acts 7.55), and
(apparently) faith and maturity of life (Acts 11.24).
Several of these
caseC
may also imply the fullness of the Holy Spirit to empower
some kind of ministry; especially in the context of the book of Acts_
where the empowering of the Holy Spirit is frequently seen t0 result
in miracles, preaching
and works of great power-
Therefore, while an experience of
filled with the Holy Spirit
may result in the gift of speaking in tongues_
0r in the use of some
other gifts that had not previously been experienced, it also may
come without the gift of speaking in tongues

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Before
this chapter; what was YOur understanding of "baptism in
the Holy Spirit"
How has youI
understanding changed, if at all?
Has your own Christian life included one 0r more events that You
call
large step of growth" in some area or another in the Christian life?
Or has
rather been one of small but continuing steps in sanctification,
in fellowship with God, and in use
spiritual gifts and power in
ministry?
Have you known people who have claimed they received
"baptism in
the Holy Spirit" after conversion? In your evaluation; has the result in
their lives been mostly positive_
mostly negative,
has it been rather
mixed? If you have had such an experience yourself, do YOu think that
understanding it as
one-time "baptism in the Holy Spirit" was essential
the experience, 0r could the same results have come in your Christian
life if it had been called "being filled with the Holy Spirit"? Do you
think
would be right t0 seek for an experience of
with the Holy
Spirit in your own life now? How might someone go about doing this?
We all realize that it is possible to overemphasize something good in the
Christian life [0 such an extent that our lives become unbalanced and not
as effective in ministry as they might be: If we think of the various ways
which we can grow in the Christian life (knowledge of the Word and
sound doctrine, prayer; love for God, love for other Christians and for
non-Christians, tNUSt in God each
worship_
holiness of life, use of
spiritual gifts, effective power of the Holy Spirit in our witness and
ministry; daily fellowship
God, etc.), in what areas do you think you
need to ask God for more growth in YOur own life? Would it be
appropriate t0 ask him for
ew
fullness of the
Spirit to
accompany
growth in those areas?
With regard to this topic of baptism in or being filled with the
Spirit; do you think that
evangelical churches generally have been
toward more divisiveness or more unity on this issue?

Chapter 40
The Perseverance of the Saints (Remaining
Christian)
Can true Christians
ose their salvation? How can we know if we
are truly born again?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Our previous discussion has dealt with many aspects of the full
salvation that Christ has earned for uS and that the Holy Spirit nOw
applies t0 uS_
But how do
we know that we shall continue [0 be
Christians throughout our lives? Is there anything that will keep uS
from
falling away from Christ; anything t0 guarantee that we Will
remain Christians until we die and that we will in fact live with God
in heaven forever? Or might it be that we will turn away from
Christ and lose the blessings of our salvation? The topic of the
perseverance of the saints speaks t0 these questions_
The
perseverance of the saints means that all those who are truly born
again will be kept by God $ power and will persevere as Christians
until the end of their lives_
and that only those who persevere until
the end have been truly born again:
This definition has tWO parts t0 it. It indicates first that there is
assurance t0 be given [0 those who are truly born
tor it
reminds them that God $ power will
them as Christians until
and
will surely live with Christ in heaven forever: On
the other hand, the second half of the definition makes
clear that
continuing in the Christian life is one of the evidences that
person
is truly born again. It is important to keep this aspect of the doctrine
in mind as well, lest false assurance be given t0 people who were
never really believers in the first place:
It should be noted that this question is one 0n which evangelical
Christians have long had significant disagreemenc: Many within the
Wesleyan/Arminian tradition have held that it is possible for
again;
keep
they
they
someone who is truly born again to lose his or her salvation, while
Reformed Christians have held that that is not possible for someone
who is truly bom
Most Baptists have followed the
Reformed tradition at this point; however; they have frequently
used the term
eternal security" 0r the
eternal security 0f the
believer" rather than the term
perseverance of the saints.
AI Who Are Trly Gorn AFain Wil
There are many passages that teach that those who are truly bom
who are genuinely Christians,
continue in the Christian
life until death and will then g0 to be with Christ in heaven: Jesus
says,
have come down from heaven, not tO do my own will, but the
him who sent me; and this is the will of him who sent me; that
should lose
of all that he has given me; but raise
up at the
last day. For this is the
of my Father; that every
who sees the
Son and believes in him should have eternal
life; and
will raise him
up at the last day: (John 6.38-40)
Here Jesus says that everyone who believes in him
have eternal life. He
says that he will raise that person up at the last
which; in this context of
believing
the Son and having eternal life, clearly means that Jesus will raise
that person up t0 eteral life with him (not just raise him up to be judged and
condemned) . It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that everyone who truly
believes in Christ will remain
Christian up t0 the day of final resurrection
into the blessings of life in the presence of God_
Moreover; this text
emphasizes that Jesus does the will of the Father; which is that he should
"lose
nothing of all that he has given me
(John 6.39). Once again, those
given
the Son by the Father will not be lost:
Another passage
emphasizing this truth is John 10.27
29,in which
Jesus says:
My sheep hear my voice
and
know them, and they follow me; and
give them eternal life
and they shall never perish, and no one shall
snatch them out of my hand My Father; who has given them tO me, is
greater than all, and no one is able t0 snatch them Out of the Father'$
hand:
Here Jesus says that those who follow him; those who are his
again:

are given eternal life. He further says that
no one shall snatch them
out of my hand" (v 28). Now some have objected t0 this that even
though no one else can take Christians out of Christ's hand,
might remove ourselves from Christ'$ hand_
But that seems [0 be
pedantic quibbling
Uver
words
does nOC
'no one
also include the
person who is in Christ's hand? Moreover; we know that
own
hearts are far from trustworthy. Therefore if the possibility
remained that we could remove ourself from Christ s hand, the
passage would hardly give the assurance that Jesus intends by it:
But more importantly; the most forceful phrase in the passage
they shall never perish
28). The Greek construction (OU me
plus aorist subjunctive) is especially emphatic and might be
translated more
explicitly;
and they shall certainly not perish
forever:
This emphasizes that those who are Jesus"
sheep'
and
who follow him, and to whom he has given eternal life, shall never
lose their salvation 0r be separated from Christ
they shall
never
perish
There are several
other passages that say those who believe have
eternal life:
One example is John 3.36_
"He who believes in the
Son has eternal life
(cf. also John 5.24; 6.4-7; 10.28;
John
5.13)
Now if this
truly etemal
life that believers have_
then it is
life that lasts forever with God. It is _
gift of God that comes with
salvation (it is put in contrast tO condemnation and eternal judgment
in John 3.16-17, 36; 10.28).
Arminians have objected that
eternal
life" is simply
quality of life,
type of life in relationship with
God, which one can have for
time and then lose.
But this
objection does not seem t0 be convincing in view of the clear
nuance of unending time involved in the adjective eternal (Gk
aionios,
eteral; without end" )
Certainly there is
special quality
about this life
but the emphasis in the adjective eternal is on the
fact that
is the opposite of death; it is the opposite of judgment
and separation from God; it is life that goes on forever in the
presence of God. And he who believes in the Son has this
eternal
life" (John 3.36).
Evidence in Paul '$ writings and the other New Testament epistles
also indicates that those who are truly born
will persevere to
the end_
There remains
no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus
(Rom. 8.1); therefore_
it would be unjust for God t0
OL"
again
give any kind of eternal punishment to those who are Christians
no condemnation remains for them, for the entire penalty for their
sins has been
Then in Romans &.30, Paul emphasizes the clear connection
between God $ eternal purposes in predestination and his working
out of those purposes in life, together
his final realization of
those purposes in
'glorifying
giving final resurrection bodies to
those whom he has brought into union with Christ:
And those
whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he
also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified '
Here
Paul sees the future event of glorification as such
certainty in
God's settled purpose that he can speak of
as if it were already
accomplished ("he also glorified"
This is true of all those who are
called and justified
that is, all those who truly become Christians _
Further evidence that God keeps those who are born
safe for
etemity is the
seal" that God places upon uS.
This
seal" is the
Holy Spirit within uS_
who also acts as God'$
guarantee
that we
will receive the inheritance promised
us: "In him You also, who
have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have
believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit; which
is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it,
the praise of his glory'
(Eph: 1.13-14). The Greek word
translated
guarantee
in this passage (arrabon) is
legal and
commercial term that means "first installment; deposit; down
payment, pledge
and represents
payment which
obligates the
contracting party to make further payments.
When God gave US
the Holy Spirit within, he committed himself t0 give all the further
blessings of eternal life and
great reward
heaven with him.
is why Paul can say that the Holy Spirit is the "guarantee of our
inheritance until we
acquire possession of it" (Eph: 1:14). AlL who
have the Holy Spirit within them; all who are truly born
have
God's unchanging promise and guarantee that the inheritance of
eterna)
life in heaven will certainly be theirs _
God'
Own
faithfulness is pledged to bring it about
Another example of assurance that believers will persevere t0 the
end
found in Paul's statement to the Philippians:
am sure that
he who began a good work in yOu will bring it to completion at the
day of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:6). It is true that the word "you" here is
paid
with
again
This
again
plural (Gk: hymas), and thus he
referring
to Christians in the
Philippian church generally; but he is still talking about the specific
believers to whom he is writing
and saying that God'$ good work
that

Peter tells his readers that they are those

phroureo) can mean both "kept

and "protected

and perhaps both kinds of guarding are intended here: God
preserving believers from escaping Out of his kingdom; and he is
protecting them from external attacks_

This emphasis on God's guarding in combination with our faith

the second half of the doctrine of
perseverance
Only Those Who Persevtre
Eil Have [en
Trulv Dorn ACjinl
While Scripture repeatedly emphasizes that those who are truly
born again will persevere to the end and
certainly have eternal
life in heaven with God, there are other passages that speak of the
necessity of continuing in faith throughout life. They make uS
realize that what Peter said in
Peter 1.5 is true, namely, that God
does not
guard us apart from our faith; but only by working through
our' faith so that he enables uS t0 continue t0 believe in him_
In this
way; those who continue t0 trust in Christ
assurance that God
is working in them and guarding them:
One example of this kind of passage is John 8.31-32:
Jesus then
said t0 the Jews who had believed in
'Ifyou continue in my
word, yOu are truly my disciples_
and YOu will know the truth, and
the truth
make you free:
Jesus is here giving
warning that
one evidence of genuine faith is continuing in his word, that is
continuing t0 believe what he says and
life of obedience
his commands. Similarly, Jesus says, "He who endures to the end
will be saved" (Matt: 10.22), as
means of warning people not tO
fall away in times of persecution:
Paul says t0 the Colossian Christians that Christ has reconciled
them to God, "in order t0 present you holy and blameless and
irreproachable before him, provided that You continue in the faith,
stable and steadfast; not shifting from the hope of the gospel which
you heard" (Col: 1.22-23). It is only natural that Paul and the other
New Testament writers would speak this way, for
addressing groups

every

and perhaps even professed that
had faith in
Christ and had been baptized into membership of the church; but
who never had true saving faith: How is Paul to distinguish such
people from true believers? How can he avoid giving them false
assurance
assurance that they will be saved eternally when in fact
they will not, unless they come t0 true repentance and faith? Paul
knows that those whose faith is not real will eventually fall away
from participation in the fellowship of the church: Therefore he
tells his readers that they will ultimately be saved, "provided that
YOU continue in the faith
(Col. 1.23). Those who continue show
thereby that
are genuine believers
But those who do not
continue in the faith show that there was no genuine faith in their
hearts in the firs
place
A similar emphasis
seen in Hebrews 3.14 (NASB):
For we have
become partakers of Christ, if we nold fast the beginning of =
ussuruIc
firm [0 the end_
verse provides an excellent
perspective on the doctrine of perseverance_
How d0 we know if
"we have become partakers of Christ"
How do we know if this
being joined to Christ has happened t0 us at some time in the past?
One way in which we know that we have come t0 genuine faith
in Christ is if we continue in faith until the end of our lives.
Attention tO the context of Hebrews 3.14 will keep us from using
this and other similar passages in
pastorally inappropriate way:
We must remember that there are other evidences elsewhere in
Scripture that give Christians assurance of salvation;
SO we should
not think that assurance that we
belong to Christ is impossible until
die. However; continuing in faith is the one means of assurance
that is named here by the author of Hebrews. He mentions this t0
wam his readers that they should not fall away from Christ; because
he is
situation where such
warning is needed. The
beginning of that section,
[WO verses
earlier; said, "Take care,
brethren_
lest there be in any of you an evil,
unbelieving heart,

God" (Heb. 3.12). In
in all of the passages where continuing to believe in Christ t0 the
end of our lives is mentioned as one indication of genuine faith, the
purpose is never [0 make those who are presently trusting in Christ

Rather; the purpose is always
warn those who are
thinking of falling away or have fallen away that if they do this it is
strong indication that they were never saved in the first place.
Thus, the necessity for continuing in faith should just be used as
waring against falling away;
waming that those who fall away
give evidence that their faith was never real.
John clearly states that when people fall away from fellowship with
the church and from belief in Christ they thereby show that their
faith was not real in the first place and that they were never
the true body of Christ. Speaking of people who have left the
fellowship of believers_
John says,

they were not of us; for if they had been of uS
they would have
continued with uS; but they went OUL, that it might be plain that they

Is it always clear which people in the church have genuine
faith and which have only an intellectual persuasion of the truth of
the gospeL
but no genuine
in their hearts? It is not always easy
t0 tell_
and Scripture mentions in several places that unbelievers in
fellowship with the visible church can give some external signs Or
indications that make them look or sound like genuine believers_
For example, Judas
who betrayed Christ, must have acted almost
exactly like the other disciples
the three years he was with
Jesus. So convincing was his conformity to the behavior patter of
the other disciples, that at the end of three years of Jesus' ministry;
when he said that one of his disciples would betray him;
did
not all turn and suspect Judas; but
rather "began t0 say to him
one after another; * Is it [?
(Matt. 26.22; cf: Mark 14.19; Luke
22.23; John 13.22). However; Jesus himself knew that there was no
genuine faith in Judas
heart; because he said at one point; "Did
not choose yoU _
the twelve
and one of yOu is
devil?" (John 6.70).
John later wrote in his gospel
that "Jesus knew from the first who
those were that did not believe, and who
was that would betray
him'
(John 6.64). But the disciples themselves did not know:
Paul also speaks of "false brethren secretly brought in" (Gal 2.4),
and says that in his journeys he has been "in danger from false

brethren:
(2 Cor: 11.26).
He also says that the servants of Satan
"disguise themselves as servants of righteousness" (2 Cor: 1:15).
This does not mean that all unbelievers in the church who
nevertheless give some signs of true conversion are servants of
Satan secretly undermining the work of the church, for some may
be in process of considering the claims of the gospel
and moving
toward real faith; others may have heard only an inadequate
explanation of the gospel message
and others may not have come
under genuine conviction of the Holy Spirit yet: But Paul' $
statements do mean that some unbelievers in the church will be
false brothers and sisters sent t0 disrupt the fellowship, while others
will simply be unbelievers who will eventually come to
genuine
saving faith_
In both cases_
however; they give several external
signs that make them look like genuine believers_
We can see this also in Jesus' statement about what will happen at
the last judgment:
Not every one who says t0 me; "Lord, Lord,
shall enter the kingdom
of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven_
On that day many will say t0 me; "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in
your name_
and cast out demons in VOuI name
and do many mighty
works in your name?" And then will
declare t0 them,
never knew
you; depart from me, YOu evildoers_
(Matt: 7.21-23)
Although these people prophesied and cast out demons and did
"many mighty works" in Jesus' name, the ability t0 do such works
did not guarantee that they were Christians. Jesus says_
never
knew you:
He does not say;
knew you
one time but
longer know you_
nor
knew you
one time but YOu strayed
away from me_
but rather;
never knew YOU_
never were
genuine believers_
A similar
is found in the parable of the sower in Mark
Jesus says, "Other seed fell on rocky ground_
where it had nOt much
soil, and immediately
sprang up, since
had no depth of soil; and
when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root ir
withered away" (Mark 4.5-6). Jesus explains that the seed sown
upon rocky ground represents people who
when they hear the
word, immediately receive it with joy; and they have no root in
themselves, but endure for
while; then, when tribulation 0r
persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall
They
teaching
away" (Mark 416-17). The fact that
"have nO rOOL in
themselves" indicates that there is no source of life within these
plants;
similarly, the people represented by them have no genuine
life of their Own within. They have an appearance of conversion
and they apparently have become Christians because they receive
the word
with joy;
but when difficulty comes_
they are nowhere [0
be found
their apparent conversion was not
genuine and there was
no real saving faith in their hearts_
The importance of continuing in faith is also affirmed in the parable
of Jesus as the
in which Christians are portrayed as branches
(John 15.1-7). Jesus says:
am the true vine_
and my Father is the vinedresser: Every branch of
mine that bears no fruit; he takes away; and every branch that does
bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit:
man does nOt
abide in me_
he is cast forth as
branch and withers; and the branches
are
gathered, thrown into the fire and burned.
(John 15.1-2, 6)
Arminians have
argued that the branches that do not bear fruit are
still true branches on the vine
Jesus refers t0
"Every branch of
mine that bears nO fruit"
2). Therefore the branches that are
gathered and thrown into the fire and burned must refer t0 true
believers that were once part of the vine but fell away and became
subject
eternal judgment
But that is not
necessary implication
of Jesus' teaching at this point: The imagery of the vine used in this
parable is limited in how much detail it can teach: In fact; if Jesus
had wanted t0 teach that there were true and false believers
associated with him, and
he wanted t0 use the
vine
and branches_
then the only way he could refer to people who do
not have genuine life in themselves would be to speak of branches
that bear no fruit (somewhat after the analogy of the seeds that fell
on rocky ground and had
'no root in themselves" in Mark 4.17).
Here in John 15 the branches that do not bear fruit; though
in some way connected to Jesus and give an outward appearance of
being genuine branches
nonetheless give indication of their true
state by the fact that they bear no fruit. This is similarly indicated
by the fact that the person
does not abide" in Christ (John 15.6)
and
cast off as
branch and withers.
If we try
press the
any further; by saying; for example
that all branches on
vine really are alive 01
would not be there in the first place,
then we are simply trying
press the imagery beyond what it is

and in that case there would be nothing in the
analogy that could represent false believers in any case. The
of the imagery is simply that those who bear fruit thereby give
evidence thar
are abiding in Christ; those who do not; are not
abiding
hin:
Finally; there are two passages in Hebrews that also affirm that
those who finally fall away may give many external signs of
conversion and may look
many ways like Christians. The first of
these _
Hebrews 6.4-6, has frequently been used by Arminians as
proof that believers can lose their salvation_
But on closer
inspection such an interpretation is not
convincing: The author
writes
For it is impossible to restore again t0 repentance those who have
once been enlightened
who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have
become partakers of the Holy Spirit; and have tasted the goodness of
the word of God and the powers of the age t0 come_
if they then
commit apostasy; since they crucify the Son of God on their own
account and hold him up
contempt: (Heb: 6.4-6)
The author continues with an example from
agriculture:
For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings
forth vegetation useful tO those for whose sake it is cultivated,
receives
from God:
But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is
worthless and near t0
being cursed; its end
tO be burned_
(Heb_
6.7-
In this agricultural metaphor; those who receive final
judgment are
compared
land that bears no vegetation or useful fruit; but rather
bears thorns and thistles.
When
recall the other metaphors
Scripture where good fruit is
sign of true spiritual life and
fruitlessness is
sign of false believers (for example
Matt: 3.8-10;
7.15-20; 12.33-35), we already have an indication that the author
speaking of people whose most trustworthy evidence of their
spiritual condition (the fruit they bear)
negative, suggesting that
the author is talking about people who are not
genuinely Christians_
Some have objected that the
description of things that have
happened to these people who fall away means that they must have
been genuinely born again. But that is not
convincing objection
we look at the individual
terms used. The author says they

But this

Therefore, this word does not mean that

but simply
that it happened once;
without
specifying whether it will be

The text further says that these people "have tasted the heavenly
gift" and that they "have tasted the goodness of the word of God
and the powers of the age t0 come
(Heb. 6.4-5). Inherent in the
idea of
is the fact that the tasting is temporary and one might
might not decide to accept the
that is tasted
For example,
the same Greek word (geuomai) is used in Matthew 27.34 t0 say
that those

something:
If we understand
in this figurative sense; as
must
be understood here since the passage is not talking about
literal food_
then it means that these people have come to
understand the heavenly gift (which probably means here that they
had experienced some of the power of the Holy Spirit at work) and
know something of the Word of God and the powers of the age
come_
It does nOt necessarily mean that

with
very close participation with him in

On the
other hand, metochos can also be used in
much looser sense,
simply to refer t0 associates 0r
companions_
We read that when the
disciples took in
great catch of fish so that their nets were
breaking;
they beckoned to their partners in the other boat t0 come
and help them" (Luke 5.7). Here it simply refers tO those who were
companions or partners with Peter and the other disciples in their
fishing work:
Ephesians 5.7 uses
closely related word
(symmetochos _
compound of metochos and the preposition syn
with"]) when Paul warns Christians about the sinful acts of
unbelievers and says_
do nOt associate with them'
(Eph 5.7). He is
not concerned that their total
nature will be transfored by the
unbelievers, but simply that
will associate with them and have
their own witness compromised and their Own
influenced to
some degree by them
By analogy; Hebrews 6.4-6
of people who have been
associated
the Holy Spirit; and thereby had their lives
influenced by him; but it need not imply that they had

0r thar
were
regenerated:
By similar
with the example of the
companions in
Luke 5.7_
Peter and the disciples could be associated with them and
evem
some degree influenced by them without having
thoroughgoing change of life caused by that association. The very
word metochos allows for
range of influence from fairly weak t0
fairly strong; for
only means
one who participates with 0r shares
with or accompanies in some activity:
This was apparently what
had happened to these people spoken of in Hebrews
who had
associated with the church and as such associated with the
work of the Holy Spirit; and no doubt had been influenced by him
in some ways in their lives_
Finally; the text says that it is impossible "tO restore
repentance
people who have experienced these
and have
then committed apostasy Some have argued that if this is
repentance [0 which they need
be restored
then
must be
genuine repentance_
But this is not necessarily the case. First, we
must realize that "repentance
(Gk: metanoia) does not need to
refer t0 inward heart repentance unto salvation.
For example;
Hebrews 12:17 uses this word tO speak of
change of mind that
Esau sought
concerning the sale of his birthright; and refers to it as
they

repentance
(metanoia) This would not have been
repentance
for salvation, but simply
change of mind and an undoing of the
transaction regarding his birthright (Note also the example of
Judas' repentance in Matt: 27.3
howbeit with
different Greek
word: )
The cognate verb "to repent" (Gk metanoeo) is sometimes used
refer nOt tO saving repentance_
but just to sorrow for individual
offenses in Luke 17.3-4: "If your brother sins_
rebuke him, and if
he repents forgive him; and
he sins against Yu seven times in the
and tums t0 YOu seven times_
and says
repent;
you muSt
forgive him.
We conclude that "repentance'
simply means
SOITOw for actions that have been done or for sins that have been
committed_
Whether or not it is
genuine saving repentance,
"repentance unto salvation_
may nol be
always evident right away:
The author of Hebrews
nor concerned
specify whether
genuine repentance or nOL: He is simply saying that if someone has
SOHTOw for sin and comes [0 understand the
gospel and
experiences these various blessings of the Holy Spirit's work (no
doubt in fellowship with the church), and then turns away, it will
not be
possible to restore such
person again [0 .
place of sorrow
for sin. But this does not necessarily imply that the repentance was
genuine saving repentance
the first place_
At this point we may ask what kind of person is described by all of
these terms
These are no doubt people who have been affiliated
closely with the fellowship of the church. They have had some
SOITOw for sin (repentance) They have clearly understood the
gospel (they have been enlightened) They have come to appreciate
the attractiveness of the Christian life and the change that comes
about in people's lives because of becoming
Christian, and
have probably had answers [0 prayer in their own lives and felt the
power of the
Spirit at work; perhaps even using some spiritual
gifts in the manner of the unbelievers in Matthew 7.22 (they have
become
associated
the work of the Holy Spirit or have
become
partakers" of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the heavenly
gift and the powers of the age of come) They have been exposed to
the true preaching of the Word and have appreciated much of its
teachings (they have tasted the goodness of the Word of God)
But then in
of all this, if they
commit apostasy" and "crucify
the Son of God on their own account and hold him up t0 contempt"
day,
they
Holy

spite
(Heb. 6.6) , then they are willfully
rejecting all of these blessings
and turning decidedly against them. Perhaps all of us have known
in our own churches people who (sometimes by their own
profession) have
been affiliated with the fellowship of the
church but are not themselves born-again Christians
They have
thought about the gospel
tor years and have continued t0 resist the
wooing of the Holy Spirit in their lives_
perhaps through an
unwillingness to give up lordship of their lives to Jesus and
preferring
cling t0 it themselves.
Now the author tells us that if these people willfully turn away from
all of these temporary blessings, then it will be impossible t0
restore them
to any kind of repentance 0r sorrow for sin.
Their hearts will be hardened and their consciences calloused_
What
more could be done to bring them to salvation? [f we tell them
Scripture
true they will say that they know it but they have
decided
reject it: If we tell them God answers prayer and changes
lives
will respond that-
know that as well; but
want
of it: If we tell them that the Holy Spirit is powerful
work in people' s lives and the gift of eternal life is
beyond
description, they will say that they understand that; but they want
nothing of it Their repeated familiarity with the
of God and
their experience of many influences of the Holy Spirit has simply
served t0 harden them against conversion
Now the author of Hebrews knows that there are some in the
community t0 which he writes who are in danger of
away in
just this way (see Heb 2.3; 3.8,12, 14-15; 4.1,7, H; 10.26,29,
35-36, 38-39; 12.3, 15-17). He wants [O wam them that; though
have participated in the fellowship of the church and
experienced
number of God's blessings in their lives, yet if they
fall away after all that; there is no salvation for them: This does not
imply that he thinks that true Christians could fall away
Hebrews
3.14 implies quite the opposite_
But he wants them tO gain
dssuialice
of salvation through their continuing in faith, and thereby
implies that if
fall away it would show that
never were
Christ $ people in the first place (see Heb
3.6: "We are his house if
we hold fast our confidence and
in our hope" ).
Therefore the author wants tO give
severe
those in
danger of slipping away from their Christian profession: He wants
tO use the strongest language possible to say;
is how far

"Here
person can come in
experiencing temporary blessings and still not

He is warning them to watch out, because
depending on temporary blessings and experiences is not enough:
To do this he talks not of any tue change of heart or any good fruit
produced
but simply about the temporary blessings and
experiences that have come t0 these persons and have given them
some
understanding of Christianity:
For this reason he immediately passes from this description of those
who commit apostasy tO
further analogy that shows that these
people who fell away never had any
genuine fruit in their lives.
we explained above, verses 7-8 speak of these people in terms of
thorns and thistles,
the kind of crop that is brought forth on land
that has no worthwhile life in itself even though it receives repeated
blessings from God (in terms of the

We should notice here that people who

fruit and now does not, but that
are like land that never bore
good fruit; but only thorns and thistles: The land may look
before the crops start
come Up, but the fruit gives the genuine
evidence, and it is bad
Strong support for this interpretation of Hebrews 6.4-8 is found in
the verse
immediately following: Though the author has been
speaking very harshly about the possibility of falling away; he then
returns t0
speak to the situation of the great majority of the hearers_
whom he thinks to be genuine Christians
He says _
"Though we

But the question
"better

"better

appropriate
contrast (0 the
good things" that have been mentioned
verses
6: the author is convinced that most of his readers have experienced

Holy Spirit and the church talked about in verses 4-6.
the author talks about these
by saying (literally) that

that have salvation in addition t0 those

He thus shows that he can use
brief phrase [0 say that people

many phrases), and he shows, moreover; that the people whom he
speaks of in verses 4
are not saved_
What exactly are these "better

similar teaching is found in Hebrews 10.26-31. There the author
says,

29 NIV)
deserves eternal punishment: This again is
strong waming
away; but it should not be taken as proof that someone who
has truly been bom
can lose his 0r her salvation_
When the
author talks about the blood of the covenant "that sanctified him;
the word sanctified is used simply t0 refer to
external
sanctification
like that of the ancient Israelites, by outward
connection with God'
people:
The passage does not talk about
someone who is genuinely saved_
but someone who has received
some beneficial moral influence through contact with the church:
One other passage in John'$

possibility of loss of salvation: In Revelation 3.5_
Jesus says_
"He
who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments, and
will not
blot his name OUt of the book of life:
Some have claimed that when
Jesus says this he implies that it is possible that he would blot Out
the names of some people from the book of life
who had
already had their names written in it and
#ere
thus already saved
But the fact that Jesus emphatically states that he will not do
something should not be taken as teaching that he will do that same
thing in other cases_
The same kind of Greek construction
used
L0 give an emphatic negation in John 10.28, where Jesus says_
give them eternal life, and they shall never perish
This does not
mean that there are some of Jesus
sheep who do not hear his voice
and follow him and who will perish; it is simply affirming that his
sheep certainly will not perish: Similarly; when God says,
will
fail you nor forsake you" (Heb: 13.5), it does not imply that
leave 0r forsake others_
emphatically states that he
will not
leave nor forsake his people: Or; in even
closer parallel;
in Matthew 12.32, Jesus says, "Whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age
in tne age t0 come:
This does not imply that some sins will be forgiven in the age t0
come (as Roman Catholics claim in support for the doctrine of
purgatory)
that is simply an error in reasoning
[O say that
something will not happen in the age
come does not imply that it
might happen in the age tO comel! In the same way; Revelation 3.5
is just
strong assurance that those who are clad in the white
garments and who have remained faithful to Christ will not have
their names blotted out of the book of life:
Finally; one passage from the Old Testament is sometimes used to
argue that people can lose their salvation: the story of the Holy
Spirit departing from
Saul. But Saul should nor be taken as an
example of someone who lost his salvation
for when "the Spirit of
the LORD departed from Saul" (1 Sam. 16.14), it was immediately
after Samuel
had anointed David
and "the Spirit of the LORD
Came
mightily upon David from that day forward" (1 Sam: 16.13).
In fact; the Spirit of the Lord coming upon David is reported in the
immediately previous sentence t0 the one in which we read that the
Spirit departed from Saul: This close connection means that

But that does

to tell from the pages of the Old Testament whether Saul,
throughout his life, was (a) an unregenerate man who had
leadership capabilities and was used by God as
demonstration of
the fact that someone worthy to be
in the eyes of the world
was not thereby suited to be
over the Lord $ people
or (b) a

What Cun Gixe a Eeliauer Gemuina
If it is true, as explained in the previous section, that those who are
unbelievers and who finally fall away may give many external signs
of conversion, then what will serve as evidence of genuine
conversion? What can give real
assurance t0
real
believer? We
can list three categories of questions that
person could ask of
himself or herself:
1. Do
Have
Present 'Irust in Christ for Salvation? Paul tells the
Colossians that they will be saved on the last day;
provided that You continue
in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel
which you heard" (Col. 1:23). The author of Hebrews says
We share in
Christ; if only we hold our first confidence firm tO the end" (Heb: 3.14) and
encourages his readers t0 be imitators of those
through faith and
patience inherit the promises'
(Heb: 6.12). In fact; the most famous verse in
the entire Bible uses
present tense verb that may be translated_
whoever
continues believing in him'
may have eternal life (see John 3.16).
Therefore
person should ask himself or herself;
Do
today have
trust in Christ t0
forgive my sins and take me without blame into
heaven forever? Do
have confidence in my heart that he has saved
me? If
were to die tonight and stand before God's judgment seat;
and if he were t0 ask me why he should let me into heaven_
would
begin to think of my good deeds and depend on them
would
without hesitation say that
am depending on the merits of Christ
and am confident that he is
sufficient Savior?"
This emphasis on present faith in Christ stands in contrast t0 the
practice of some church
testimonies
where people repeatedly
recite details of
conversion experience that may have happened 20
or 30 years ago. If
testimony of
faith is
genuine,

2. Is There Evidence of
Regenerating Work of the Holy Spirit in My
Heart? The evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts comes in
many different forms. Although we should not put confidence in the
demonstration of miraculous works (Matt: 7.22), or long hours and years of
work at some local church (which may simply be building with
wood_
straw
[in terms of
Cor: 312] to further one
own ego or power over
others_
attempt tO earn merit with God); there
many other evidences
real work of the Holy Spirit in one
heart:
there is
subjective testimony of the Holy Spirit within our
hearts bearing witness that we are God's children (Rom: &.15-16;
John 4.13). This testimony
usually be accompanied by
sense
led by the Holy Spirit in paths of obedience t0 God' $ Will
(Rom: &.14).
addition, if the
Spirit is genuinely at work in our lives, he
will be producing the kind of character traits that Paul calls "the
fruit of the Spirit" (Gal: 5.22). He lists several attitudes and
character traits that are produced by the Holy Spirit: "love, joy;
peace; patience
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness
self-
control" (Gal. 5.22-23). Of course_
question is nOt; "Do
perfectly exemplify all of these characteristics in my life?" but
rather;
Are these things
genera
characteristic of my life? Do
sense these attitudes in my heart? Do others (especially those
closest to me) see these traits exhibited in my life? Have
been
growing in then over
period of years?" There is no suggestion in
the New Testament that any non-Christian, any unregenerate
person, can convincingly fake these character traits, especially for
those who know the person most closely.
Related t0 this kind of fruit is another kind of fruit
the results of
one
life and ministry as they have influence on others and on the
church: There are some people who profess t0 be Christians but
whose influence on others is to discourage them; t0
them
down_
injure their faith_
and t0 provoke controversy and
divisiveness. The result of their life and ministry is not to build up
others and t0 build up the church; but to tear
down_
On the other
hand, there are those who seem t0 edify others in every
conversation, every prayer; and every work of ministry
put
their hand to. Jesus said, regarding false prophets
You will know

them by their fruits.
Every sound tree bears good fruit, but the
bad tree bears evil fruit
Thus yOu will know them by their

(Matt_ 7.16-20).
Another evidence of work of the Holy Spirit is
continuing
believe and accept the sound teaching of the church. Those who
begin to deny major doctrines of the faith give serious negative
indications concerning their salvation: "No one who denies the Son
has the Father:
If what you heard from the beginning abides
you_
then you will abide in the Son and in the Father"
John 2.23
24). John also says,;
"Whoever knows God listens to uS
and he who
is not of God does not listen [0 uS
(1 John 4.6). Since the New
Testament writings are the current replacement for the apostles like
John_
we might also say that whoever knows God will continue to
read and to delight in God'$ Word
and will continue [0 believe it
fully: Those who do not believe and delight in God s Word give
evidence that they are not "of God_
Another evidence of
genuine salvation is
continuing present
relationship with Jesus Christ: Jesus says_
Abide in me, and
and; "If you abide in me
and my words abide in YOu; ask
whatever YOu will, and it shall be done for you" (John 15.4, 7)
This
in Christ will include not only day-by-day trust in him in
various situations_
but also certainly regular fellowship with him in
prayer and worship
Finally;
major area of evidence that we are genuine believers is
found in
life of obedience t0 God's commands- John says, "He
who says
know him' but disobeys his commandments is
and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps his word_
in him

rather saying that in general our lives
ought to be ones of imitation of Christ and likeness to him in what
we do and say If we have genuine saving faith; there will be clear
results in obedience in our lives (see also
John 3.9-10, 24; 5.18)
Thus James can say; "Faith by itself; if it has no works_
is dead" and
by my works will show YOu my faith
(James 2.17-18).
Une
large area of obedience to God includes love for fellow Christians
"He who loves his brother abides in the light" (1 John 2.10). "We
know that we have passed out of death into life_
because

abiding
Hiar;
the brethren. He who does not love abides in death" (1 John 3.14,
cE: 3.17; 4.7). One evidence of this love is continuing in Christian
fellowship (1 John 2.19), and another is giving t0
brother in need
John 3.17; cf: Matt: 25.31-46).
3. Do
See
Long-Term Pattern of Growth in My Christian Life? The
first two areas of assurance dealt with present faith and present evidence of
the Holy Spirit at work in our lives_
But Peter gives one more kind of test that
we can use t0 ask whether we are
genuinely believers
He tells us that there
are some character traits which; if we keep on increasing in them; will
guarantee that we will
never fall" (2 Peter 1:10). He tells his readers to add
t0 their faith "virtue
knowledge
self-control
steadfastness
godliness
brotherly affection
love" (2 Peter 1.5
he says that
these things are to belong to his readers and t0 continually "abound" in their
lives (2 Peter 1.8). He adds that they are to "be the more zealous t0 confirm
your call and election
and says then that "ifyou d this (literally; "these
things,
referring
the character traits mentioned in vv 5-7) YOu will never
fall" (2 Peter 1:10)
The way that we confirm Our call and election_
then
is t0 continue
grow in "these things
This implies that Our assurance of
salvation can be
something that increases over time in our lives:
Every year that we add t0 these character traits in our lives _
we gain
greater and greater assurance of 0ur salvation. Thus, though young
believers can have
quite strong confidence in their salvation_
that
assurance can increase t0 even
deeper certainty over the years in
which they grow tOward Christian maturity.
If they continue
add these things they will confirm their call and election and will
never fall:
The result of these three questions that we can ask ourselves should
be t0 give strong assurance t0 those who are
genuinely believers_
this way the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints will be
tremendously
comforting doctrine. No one who has such assurance
should wonder; "Will
be able t0 persevere t0 the end of my life
and therefore be saved?" Everyone who
assurance through
such
self-examination should rather think; "Tam truly born again;
therefore
certainly persevere t0 the end, because
am being
guarded "by God'$ power
through my faith
Peter 1.5)
and therefore
will never be lost: Jesus will raise me up at the last
day and
will enter into his kingdom forever" (John 6.40).
Then
gains
Wul
working
On the other hand, this doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, if
rightly understood, should cause genuine worry, and even fear; in
the hearts of any who are
~backsliding
straying away from
Christ. Such persons must clearly be warned that only those who
persevere
the end have been truly bom
If they fall away
from their profession of faith in Christ and life of obedience t0 him;
may not really be saved
in fact, the evidence that
are
giving is that
are not Saved, and
never really were saved:
Once they stop trusting in Christ and obeying him ([ am speaking in
terms of outward evidence) they have no genuine assurance of
salvation
and
should consider themselves unsaved, and tum [0
Christ in repentance and ask him for forgiveness of their sins.
At this point; in terms of pastoral care
with those who have strayed
away from their Christian profession
we should realize that
Calvinists and Arminians (those who believe in the perseverance of
the saints and those who think that Christians can lose their
salvation) will both counsel
"backslider'
in the same way:
According
the Arminian this person was
Christian at one time
but is no longer
Christian. According to the Calvinist, such
person never really was
Christian in the first place and is not one
now
But in both cases the biblical counsel given would be the
same:
You do not appear t0 be
Christian nOW
YOU muSt repent
of your sins and trust in Christ for yOur salvation!" Though the
Calvinist and Arminian would differ on their interpretation of the
previous history;
would agree on what should be done in the
present
But here we see why the phrase eternal security can be quite
misleading
In some
evangelical
churches
instead of teaching the
full and balanced presentation of the doctrine of the perseverance of
the saints
pastors have sometimes taught
watered-down version,
which in effect tells people that all who have once made
profession of
and been baptized are
eternally secure:
The
result is that some people who are not
genuinely converted at all
may
come forward" at the end of an
evangelistic sermon to profess
faith in Christ, and may be baptized shortly after that; but then they
leave the fellowship of the church and live
life no different from
the one they lived before
this
eternal security:'

way people are given false assurance and are

your Christian life over time? Are you
in your Own power [0

in Christ; Or in God'$ power to keep your faith active
and alive?
If you have doubts about whether YOu are truly born
what is it in
your life that is giving reason for those doubts? What would Scripture
encourage YOu to do to resolve those doubts (see
Peter 1.5-I; also
Matt_ 11.28-30; John 6.37)? Do you think that Jesus nOw knows about
your doubts and understands them? What do you think he would like you

Death and the Intermediate State
What is the purpose of death in the Christian life? What happens
our bodies and souls when we die?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Why Do Christians Die?
Our treatment of the application of redemption must include
consideration of death and the question of how Christians should
view their own death and the death of others_
We also muSt ask
whal
happens
[0 uS between the time that we die and the time that
Christ returns
give US new resurrection bodies_
Death Is Not
Punishment for Christians. Paul tells uS clearly that there
no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom: 8.1). All the
penalty for our sins has been
Therefore, even though we know that
Christians die,
should not view the death of Christians as
punishment
from God or in any way
result of
penalty due to us for our sins_
It is tNe
that the penalty for sin is death, but that penalty no longer applies to uS
not
in terms of physicab
death; and not in terms of spiritual death 0r separation
from God: All of that has been paid for by Christ: Therefore there must be
another reason than punishment for OUI sins if we are t0 understand why
Christians die:
2. Death Is the Final Outcome of
Fallen World: In his great
wisdom; God decided that he would not apply to us the benefits of Christ $
redemptive work all at once_
Rather; he has chosen t0 apply the benefits of
salvation t0 uS
gradually
over time (as we have seen in chapters 33-40).
Similarly; he has not chosen t0 remove all evil from the world immediately;
but
wait until the final judgment and the establishment of the new heaven
and new earth (see chapters 56 and 52). In short;
still live in
fallen world
and ouI
experience of salvation is still incomplete_
The last aspect of the fallen world to be removed will be death Paul
paid:
Living '
says:
Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom
God the Father
after destroying every rule and every authority and pOwer: For he
must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet: The last
enemy [0 be destroyed
death (1 Cor: 15.26)
When Christ returns_
then shall come
pass the saying that is written:
Death is swallowed up in victory:
"0 death; where is your victory?
death; where is your sting?"
Cor: 15.54-55)
But until that time death remains
reality even in the lives of
Christians- Although death does not come [0 4S as
penalty fOr our
individual sins (for that has been
by Christ), it does come t0 uS
result of living in
fallen world, where the effects of sin have
not all been removed_
Related to the experience of death are other
results of the fall that harm our physical bodies and signal the
presence of death in the world
Christians aS well as non-
Christians experience aging
injuries
and natural disasters
(such as floods, violent storms
and earthquakes) Although God
often answers prayers tO deliver Christians (and also non-
Christians) from some of these effects of the fall for
time (and
thereby indicates the nature of his coming kingdom), nevertheless
Christians eventually experience all of these things t0 some
measure
and, until Christ returns
all of us will grow old and die:
The
last enemy
has not yet been destroyed_
And God has chosen
allow uS
experience death before we
all the benefits of
salvation that have been earned for uS_
God Uses the Experience of Death to Complete Our Sanctification:
Throughout our Christian lives we know that we never have to pay any
penalty for sin; for that has all been taken by Christ (Rom: &.1).
Therefore
when we do
experience pain and suffering in this life,
should never think
it is because God is
punishing US (for Our harm). Sometimes suffering is
simply
result of living in
sinful, fallen world, and sometimes it is because
God is disciplining Us (for our
good); but in all cases
we are assured by
Romans 8.28 that
God causes all things t0 work together for good
those
paid
illnesses;
gain
who love God, to those who are called according t0 His purpose'
(NASB)
The positive purpose for God's discipline is clear in Hebrews 12,
where we read:
The Lord disciplines him whom he loves-
He disciplines us for OuI
good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline
seems
painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of
righteousness t0 those who have been trained by it (Heb:
12.6, 10-
11)
Not all discipline is in order to correct us from sins that we have
committed; it can also be allowed by God to strengthen 4s in order
that we may gain greater ability
trust God and resist sin in the
challenging
of obedience
We see this clearly in the life of
Jesus, who, though he was without sin; yet "learned obedience
through what he suffered " (Heb. 5.8).
He was made perfect
through suffering
(Heb: 2.10). Therefore we should see all the
hardship and suffering that comes tO Us in life as something that
God brings [O 4s t0 do us good, strengthening Our trust in him and
Our' obedience
and ultimately
increasing
our
ability to glorify him.
Consequently; we should view the aging and weakness and
sometimes sickness leading up to death as another kind of
discipline that God allows US tO g0 through in order that through
this process our sanctification might be furthered and ultimately
completed when we go to be in the Lord $ presence: The challenge
that Jesus gives t0 the church in Smyrna could really be given to
every believer: "Be faithful unto death; and
will give You the
crOWn of life'
(Rev: 2.10). Paul says his goal in life
that he may
become like Christ:
may know him and the power ot his
resurrection; and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his
death
(Phil. 3.10). Paul thought about the way in which Jesus
died, and made it his goal to exemplify the same characteristics in
his life when
came time for him t0 die
that in whatever
circumstances he found himself, he;
like Christ, would continue
obeying God
God;
forgiving others_
and caring for the
needs of those
around him; thus in every way bringing glory
God
even in his death Therefore when in prison, without
knowing
whether he would die there or come out alive, he could still say; "it
is my eager expectation and hope that
shall not be at all ashamed_
but that with full courage nOw as always Christ will be honored in
Path
"that
trusting
my body; whether by life or by death
(Phil: 1.20).
The understanding that death is not in any way
punishment for
sin, but simply
something God
through in order to make
uS more like Christ, should be
great encouragement [0 4S
should take away from uS the fear of death that haunts the minds of
unbelievers (cf. Heb. 2:15). Nevertheless, although God will bring
good to uS through the process of death, we must still remember
that death
not natural; it is not right; and in
world created by
God
is something that ought not t0 be: It is an enemy; something
that Christ will finally destroy (1 Cor: 15.26).
Our Experience of Death Completes Our Union With Christ. Another
reason why God allows Us to experience death, rather than taking uS
immediately to heaven when we become Christians_
is that through death we
imitate Christ in what he did and thereby experience closer union with him_
Paul can say that we
fellow heirs with Christ "provided we suffer with him
in order that we may also be glorified with him" (Rom: &.17).
And Peter tells
his readers not to be surprised at the
testing that comes on them, but
encourages them;
rejoice in S0 far as you share Christ $ sufferings, that yOu
may also rejoice and be glad when his glory
revealed"
Peter 4.13). As
we noted above_
such union with Christ in
suffering includes union with him
in death as well (see Phil. 3.10). Jesus is the "pioneer and perfecter of our
faith" (Heb. 12.2) , and we follow after him as we nun the race of life. Peter
writes, "Christ also suffered for YOu; leaving YOu an example, that you should
follow in his steps"
Peter 2.21).
Our Obedience to God Is More Important Than Preserving Our Own
Lives _
If God uses the experience of death to deepen Our trust in him and to
strengthen our obedience to him, then
is important that we remember that
the world'$
of preserving one'$ Own physical life at all costs
not the
highest goab
Christian: obedience
God and faithfulness to him
every circumstance is far more important: This is why Paul could say; "[am
ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of
the Lord Jesus'
(Acts 21.13; cf: 25.11). He told the Ephesian elders_
do not
account my life of any value nor as precious t0 myself; if only
may
accomplish my course and the ministry which
received from the Lord Jesus,
testify t0 the gospeE
of the grace of God" (Acts 20.24).
It was this conviction
that obedience t0 God
far more important
than the preservation of life
that gave Paul courage t0 go back
into the city of Lystra after he had just been stoned and left for dead
brings
Ofe
flery
goal
(Acts 14.20), and then retum there
shortly thereafter (Acts
14.21-22). He endured many sufferings and dangers (2 Cor: 11.23 _
27) , often risking his life, in order to obey Christ fully Therefore he
could say at the end of his life
with
note of great triumph; "The
time of my departure has come.
have fought the good fight,
have
finished the race
have kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4.6-7). This same
conviction empowered Old Testament saints t0 accept martyrdom
rather than sin: "Some were [ortured
accept release, that
they might rise again to
better life"
(literally, "that they might
obtain
better resurrection;
Heb: 11.35). This conviction also gave
Peter and the other apostles courage_
when
the threat of
death,
say,
We must obey God rather than men
(Acts 5.29).
Certainly this was the point of Jesus
command t0 the church at
Smyrna,
"Be faithful unto death, and
will give you the crown of
life"
(Rev: 2.10).
We also read that there will be
rejoicing
heaven
when the faithful saints have conquered the devil "by the blood of
the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not
their lives even unto death
(Rev: 12.11).
The persuasion that we may honor the Lord even in our death, and
that faithfulness to him is far more important than preserving our
lives
has given courage and motivation [0 martyrs throughout the
history of the church: When faced with
choice of preserving their
own
and sinning
giving Up their own lives and being
faithful, they chose t0 give up their Own lives
"they loved not
their lives even unto death" (Rev: 12.11). Even in times where there
is little persecution and little likelihood of martyrdom; it would be
for US t0 fix this truth in our minds once for all, for if we are
give up even our lives for faithfulness to God, we shall
find
much easier [0 give up everything else for the sake of Christ
as well
Moi Shculd We Think of Ou
Daath
4d the Death o[ Uther?
Our Own Death: The New Testament encourages US t0 view our Own
death not with fear but with joy at the prospect of going to be with Christ:
Paul says
"We would rather be away from the body and at home
the
Lord" (2 Cor: 5.8). When he is in prison, not knowing whether he will be
executed or released
he can say:
For t0 me t0 live is Christ, and to die is gain. If it is to be life in the
flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.
Yet which

My desire is to depart
and be with Christ; for that is far better: (Phil. 1.21-23)
We also read John'$ word in Revelation,
And
heard
voice from heaven
saying;
Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth:
'Blessed indeed,
says the Spirit; 'that they may rest from their labors, for
their deeds follow them!'
(Rev: 14.13).
Believers need have no fear of death, therefore
for Scripture
reassures uS that not even "death" will "separate uS from the love of
God in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom_
8.38-39; cf: Ps. 23.4). In
Jesus died in order that he might
deliver all those who through fear
of death were subject to lifelong bondage'
(Heb. 2.15).
This verse
reminds US that
clear testimony t0 our lack of fear of death will
provide
strong witness for Christians in an age that tries t0 avoid
talking about death and has no answer for it
2. The Death of Christian Friends and Relatives. While we can look
forward [0 Our own death with
joyful expectation of
in Christ'$
presence_
our attitude
be somewhat different when we experience the
death of Christian friends and relatives. In these cases we will experience
genuine SOrTow
but mixed with joy that
have gone to be with the Lord:
is nOt wrong
express real
sOrrow at the loss of fellowship with
loved ones who have died
and sOrTow also for the suffering and
hardship that
may have gone through
death:
Sometimes Christians think it shows lack of faith if they mourn
deeply for
brother 0r sister Christian who has died_
But Scripture
does not support that view; because when Stephen was stoned_
read that
Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation
Over
him-
(Acts 8.2). If there
Wds
certainty that someone went
to be with the Lord, it occurred in the case of Stephen. As he died,
he said, "Behold,
see the heavens opened_
and the Son of man
standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7.56). Then when he was
dying; he prayed,
Lord Jesus
receive my spirit,
and, "Lord, do
not hold this sin against them
(Acts 7.59-60).
And this occured in
Jerusalem_
with all the apostles still present; those apostles who had
seen Jesus himself after he had been raised from the dead_
There
was no lack of faith on anyone
part that Stephen was in heaven
experiencing great joy in the presence of the Lord. Yet in spite of
this, "Devout men buried Stephen_
and made
lamentation
over him
(Acts 8.2). Their SOrTow showed the genuine
that
fact,
being
will
they
they
prior
ever
great
grief
felt at the loss of fellowship with someone whom
loved,
and it was nOt wrong t0 express this SOrTow-
was right Even
Jesus, at the tomb of Lazarus_
wept" (John 11.35), experiencing
SOITOw at the fact that Lazarus had died_
that his sisters and others
Were
experiencing such grief; and also_
no dOubt; at the tact that
there was death in the world at all, for ultimately it is unnatural
and
ought not to be in
world created by God.
The Ephesian elders,
whom Paul had taught personally for three
years, later
wept and embraced Paul and kissed hin, sorrowing
most of all because of the word he had spoken; that they should see
his face no more
(Acts 20.37-38). And Paul himself; in the same
letter in which he expressed such
desire t0 depart from this life
and be with Christ, said that if Epaphroditus had died
he himself
would have had
sorrow upon sorrow
(Phil: 2.27). Moreover;
King David_
the man after God $ OWn heart, the man who in his
psalms frequently spoke of living forever with God_
nonetheless
had great sorrow when he learned that Saul and Jonathan had died
(2 Sam: 1:11-27).
Nevertheless, the sorrow that we feel is clearly mingled with hope
and joy: Paul does not tell the Thessalonians that they should not
at all concerning their loved ones who have died, but he
writes_
you may not grieve aS Others do who have no hope'
Thess. 4.13)
they should not grieve in the same way, with the
same bitter despair; that unbelievers have
But certainly they should
grieve_
He assures them that Christ "died for US S0 that whether we
wake or sleep we might live with him"
Thess. 5.10), and thereby
encourages them that those who have died have gone to be with the
Lord. That is why Scripture can say; "Blessed are the dead who die
in the Lord henceforth
that they may rest from their labors"
(Rev: 14.13). In fact; Scripture even tells us, "Precious in the sight
of the LORD
the death of his saints
(Ps. 116.15).
Therefore, though we have genuine SOrrOw when Christian friends
and relatives die,
also can say with Scripture; "0 death_
where is
your victory? 0 death
where is your sting?
Thanks be to God_
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"
Cor:
15.55-57). Though we moumn; our mourning should be mixed with
worship of God and thanksgiving for the life of the loved one who
has died. Worship is especially important at this time, as we see in
the examples of David and of Job_
When David's child died, he

Then
David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and

Similarly, when Job heard of the death of his ten children,
Then Job arose
and rent his robe
and shaved his head, and fell upon
the ground, and worshiped. And he said, "Naked

unbelief until the point of death: In some cases we simply do not

Moreover; it is often

David spoke freely and publicly about the good things Saul had

The Bible Does Not 'Teach the Doctrine of _
Purgatory: The fact that the
souls of believers g0 immediately into God =
presence means that there is no
such thing aS purgatory: In Roman Catholic teaching; purgatory is the place
where the souls of believers g0 to be further purified from sin until
are
ready to be admitted into heaven. According to this view; the sufferings of
purgatory are given
God
substitute for the punishment for sins that
believers should have received in time
but did not.
Speaking of purgatory; Ott
says:
Suffrages operate in such
matter that the satisfactory value of the
good works is offered to God in substitution for the temporal
punishment for sins which the poor souls still have to render: It
operates by way of remission of temporal
punishments due t0 sins.
But this doctrine is not taught in Scripture
and it is in fact contrary
the verses quoted immediately above. The Roman Catholic
Church has found support for this doctrine, not in the pages of
canonical Scripture as we defined it in chapter
above_
and as
Protestants have accepted it since the Reformation; but in the
writings of the Apocrypha_
particularly in 2 Maccabees 12.42-45-
[Judas Maccabeus_
the leader of the Jewish forces] also took
collection, man by man_
to the amount of 2,000 drachmas of silver;
and sent it [0 Jerusalem t0

sin
this he
acted very well and honorably; taking into account the resurrection:
For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise
it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the
dead. But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for
those who fall asleep in godliness_
it was
holy and pious thought
Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be
delivered from their sin:
Here it is clear that prayer for the dead is approved, and also
making an
offering
God to deliver the dead
their sin. But in
response
must be said that this literature is not equal to Scripture
in authority; and should not be taken as an authoritative source of
doctrine_
Moreover; it contradicts the clear statements about
departing and being with Christ quoted above, and thereby opposes
the clear
of New Testament Scripture.
Furthermore
when
it talks about the offering of Judas making
atonement [Gk
exilasmos
propitiation
for the dead" it contradicts the explicit
they
ffering;
doing

from
teaching
teaching of the New Testament that Christ alone made atonement
for us . Finally, this passage in
Maccabees is difficult tO square
evem
with Roman Catholic teaching
because it teaches that soldiers
who had died in the mortal sin of idolatry (which cannot be
forgiven, according
Catholic teaching) should have prayers and
sacrifices offered for them with the possibility that they will be
delivered from their
suffering:
Roman Catholic theology finds support for the doctrine of
purgatory primarily in the passage from 2 Maccabees quoted above,
and in the
of the tradition of the church
Other passages
cited by Ott in support of the doctrine of purgatory are
Timothy
1.18; Matthew 5.26;
Corinthians 3.15; and Matthew 12.32. In 2
Timothy 1:18, Paul says
concerning Onesiphorus; "When he
arrived in Rome he searched for me eagerly and found me
-may
the Lord grant him t0 find mercy from the Lord on that Day
-and
You well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus
(2 Tim.
1.17-18).
The claim of those who find support for the doctrine of
purgatory is that "Onesiphorus
apparently was no longer among
the living at the time of the Second Epistle to Timothy:-
This
seems to be based on the fact that Paul refers not to Onesiphorus
himself but "the household of Onesiphorus"
Tim: 1:16);
however; that phrase does not prove that Onesiphorus had died_
but
only that Paul was
not only on him but on his
entire household: This
not be unusual since Onesiphorus had
served in Ephesus where Paul had worked for three years (2 Tim
1.18; cf. 4.19). To build support for purgatory on the idea that
Onesiphorus had already died is simply to build it on an assumption
that cannot be supported with clear evidence: (It is not unusual for
Paul t0 express
wish that some Christians would be blessed in the
of Judgment
see
Thess. 5.23.)
In Matthew 12.32, Jesus says
Whoever speaks against the
Spirit will not be
forgiven, either in this age Or in the age to come:
Ott says that this sentence "leaves open the possibility that sins are
forgiven
only in this world but in the world to come:
However; this is simply an error in
reasoning:
to say that
something
will not happen in the age to come does not imply that it might

statement that says that people suffer for the purpose of

But Scripture nowhere says this.
Corinthians 315 Paul says that on the
of Judgment; the
work that everyone has done will be judged and tested by fire, and
then says, "If any man $ work is burned Up, he

though he himself will be saved_
but only as through fire _
But this
does not speak of
person being burned or suffering punishment;
but simply of his work as being tested by fire
that which is good
will be like gold
silver; and precious stones that will last forever (v
12). Moreover; Ott himself admits that this is something that occurs
not during this age but during the day of "the general judgment;
and this further indicates that it can hardly be used as
convincing
argument for purgatory: Finally; in Matthew 5.26, after -

are
going to the court; lest the accuser hand them to the
and the

Ott understands
this as
parable teaching
"time-limited condition of punishment
in the other world.
But surely there is no indication in context
that this is
parable
Jesus is giving practical teaching about
reconciliation of human conflicts and the avoidance of situations
that naturally lead to anger and personal injury (see Matt: 5.21-26).
Other passages of Scripture that have sometimes been referred t0
support of the doctrine of purgatory
simply do not speak directly
about this idea at all; and can all easily be understood in terms of
punishment and deliverance from distress in this life, or of
life of
eternal blessing with God in heaven in the life to come_
An even more serious problem with this doctrine is that it teaches
that we must add something t0 the redemptive work of Christ; and
that his redemptive work for uS was nOt enough to pay the penalty
for all our sins. But this is certainly contrary t0 the teaching of
Scripture.
Moreover; in
pastoral sense
the doctrine of purgatory
robs believers of the
comfort that should be theirs in knowing
that those who have died have immediately gone into the presence
of the Lord, and knowing that
also
when thev die
will "depart
and be with Christ; for that is far better" (Phil. 1.23).

doctrine of soul
incorrect This doctrine teaches that when believers
die they go into
state of unconscious existence, and the next thing that they
are conscious of will be when Christ returns and raises them t0 eternal life.
This doctrine has been taught occasionally by one person or another in the
history of the church, including some Anabaptists at the Reformation, and
some of the Irvingites in England in the nineteenth century: In fact, one of
John Calvin $ first
was
tract against this doctrine;
doctrine thar
has never found wide acceptance in the church:
Support for the doctrine of soul sleep has generally been found in
the fact that Scripture several times speaks of the state of death as
"falling
(Matt. 9.24; 27.52; John I:11; Acts
7.60; 13.36;
Cor: 15.6,18, 20,51;
Thess. 413; 5.10). Moreover;
certain passages seem t0 teach that the dead do not have
conscious existence (see Ps. 6.5; 115.17 [but see
18!]; Eccl. 9.10;
Isa. 38.19). But when Scripture represents death as
sleep'
it is
simply
metaphorical expression used t0 indicate that death is only
temporary for Christians, just as
is temporary: This is clearly
seen_
for example
when Jesus tells his disciples about the death of
Lazarus. He says
Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but
g0 [0
awake him out of sleep"
(John 11:11). We should notice that Jesus
does not here say, " The soul of Lazarus is
sleeping;'
nor; in
does any passage in Scripture say that the soul of
person is
sleeping Or unconscious (a statement that would be necessary
prove the doctrine of soul sleep). Rather Jesus simply says that
Lazarus has fallen asleep
Then John explains, "Now Jesus had
spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in
sleep_
Then Jesus told them plainly;
Lazarus is dead'
(John
11.12-13).
The other passages that speak about people
when they die are likewise o be interpreted as simply
metaphorical
expression tO teach that death is temporary:
As for the passages that indicate that the dead do not praise God_
that there is
ceasing of conscious activity when people die, these
all to be understood from the perspective of life in this world_
From our
perspective it appears that once people die
do nOr
engage in these activities any longer: But Psalm 115 presents the
full biblical perspective on this viewpoint It says_
"The dead do not
praise the LORD, nor do any that g0 down into silence_
But then
continues in the very next verse with
contrast
indicating that those
who believe in God will bless the LORD forever:
But we will bless
the LORD from this [ime forth and for evermore
Praise the LORD!"

(Ps. 115.17-18).
Finally; the passages quoted above demonstrating that the souls of
believers go immediately into God'$ presence and enjoy fellowship
with him there (2 Cor: 5.8; Phil. 1.23; Luke 23.43; and Heb: 12.23)
all indicate that there is conscious existence and fellowship with
God immediately after death for the believer: Jesus did not say;
"Today you will no
longer have consciousness of anything that is
going on,
but;
Today you
be with me in Paradise -
(Luke
23.43). Certainly the conception of paradise understood at that time
was not one of unconscious existence but one of great blessing and
joy in the presence of God
Paul did not say; "My desire is t0
depart and be unconscious for
long period of time
but rather;
"My desire
depart and be with Christ-
(Phil. 1.23)
and he
certainly knew that Christ was not an unconscious
Savior;
but one who was actively living and reigning in heaven: To be with
Christ was t0 enjoy the blessing of fellowship in his presence, and
that is why to depart and be with him was "far better'
(Phil. 1.23).
That is why he says_
would rather be away from the body and
at home with the Lord" (2 Cor: 5.8).
The fact that Hebrews 12:1 says_
We are surounded by s0 great
cloud of witnesses;
just after an entire chapter spent on the
discussion
the faith of Old Testament saints who had died ( Heb
11), and the fact that the author encourages uS

with perseverance because we are surrounded by this great cloud of
witnesses_
both suggest that
who have died and gone before
have some awareness of what is going on in the earth Scripture
says very little about this, probably because
does not want US t0
t0 those who have died 0r [0 pray (0 them 0r
contact them
any way (note Saul'$ great sin in this in
Sam: 28.7-25).
Nonetheless, Hebrews 12:1-2 does give us this slight
probably
as an encouragement t0 US t0 continue also t0 be faithful to God as
were those who have died and gone to heaven before us. Similarly;
at the end of Hebrews 12
the author tells us that when we worship
we come into the presence of God in heaven
and we
come not t0
spirits of just men who are sleeping
an unconscious state'
but "to innumerable angels in festal gathering; and to the assembly
of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and [0
judge who is
God of all, and t0 the spirits of just men made perfect; and t0 Jesus,
the mediator of
new covenant" (Heb. 12.22-24)

Revelation 6.9-11 and 7.9-10 also clearly show the souls or spirits

and crying out with
loud
voice_
'Salvation

(Rev: 7.9-10). All of these passages deny the
doctrine of soul sleep
for they make it clear that the souls of
believers experience conscious fellowship with God in heaven
immediately upon death:
Did Old Testament Believers Enter Immediately Into God'$ Presence?
Some have said that; although the souls of believers since Christ $
resurrection go immediately into God'$ presence in heaven, the souls of
believers who died before Christ $ resurrection did not enjoy the blessings of
heaven but went into
place of waiting for Christ '$ work of redemption to be
complete. Sometimes this is called the limbus patrum,
simply limbo_
This
view has been especially common in Roman Catholic theology; but it has also
been held by some Lutherans_
Some of the support for this doctrine comes
from
particular view of the idea of Christ'=
descent into hell, which we
discussed in an earlier chapter:
Not many Scripture references talk about the state of Old Testament
believers after they had died
but those that give US any indication
of their state all point in the direction of immediate conscious
enjoyment
the presence of God, not of
time of
away
from God $ presence. "Enoch walked with God; and he was not; for
God took him
(Gen. 5.24; cE: Heb: 11:5). Elijah was nOt taken t0

but he

dwell in the house of the LORD for ever'
(Ps. 23.6; cf: 16.10-11;
17.15; 1.15, 18). Moreover; when Jesus answers the Sadducees_
reminds them that God says,
am the God of Abraham, and the
God ot [saac _
and the God of Jacob" and then says, "He is not God
of the dead, but of the

important t0 notice that since this is before Christ'$ resurrection,
Lazarus was in the same situation as the Old Testament saints.
Therefore
seems likely that Old Testament believers also entered
immediately into heaven and enjoyed
time of fellowship with God
upon their death
However; it may well have been true that
additional rich
and much greater rejoining came to them
when Christ returned t0 heaven at his ascension. But this does not
mean that they were transported t0 heaven for the first time_
0r that
that was the first time they enjoyed the blessing of God's presence_
Should We Pray for the Dead? Finally; the fact that the souls of believers
g0 immediately into God $ presence means that we should not pray for the
dead. Although this idea is taught in
Maccabees 12.42-45 (see above), it is
nowhere taught in the Bible itself: Moreover; there
no indication that this
was the practice of any Christians at the time of the New Testament; nor
should it have been:
Once believers die they enter into God'$ presence and
are in a state of perfect happiness with him_
What good would it do to
pray for them anymore? Final heavenly reward will be based on deeds done in
this life, as Scripture repeatedly testifies
Cor: 3.12-15; 2 Cor: 5.10; et
al.)
Further; the souls of unbelievers who die g0 to
place of punishment
and eternal separation from the presence of God_
It would do no good to pray
for them either; since their final destiny has been settled by their sin and their
rebellion against God in this life.
To pray for the dead therefore is simply to
pray for something that God has told us has already been decided
Moreover; t0 teach that we should pray for the dead, Or t0 encourage others to
do so_
would be t0 encourage false
that the destinies of people might be
changed after they die,
something which Scripture nowhere encourages US to
think It may lead people t0 much useless anxiety and much time essentially
wasted in prayers that will have absolutely no results_
and will thereby divert
attention from prayers that could be made for events for this life and could
have great effect in advancing the work of the kingdom. We should spend
time praying according to God's will
2. The Souls of Unbelievers Go Immediately
Eternal Punishment:
Scripture nevel
encourages us to think that people will have
second chance
trust in Christ after death: In fact; the situation is quite the contrary. Jesus'
saying
very

story about the rich man and Lazarus gives no
that people can cross
from hell to heaven after they have died: though the rich man in hell called
out; "Father Abraham; have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus t0 dip the end

chasm has been fixed,
in order thar those who would pass from here [0 YOu may nOt be able, and
none may cross from there [0 US "
(Luke 16.24-26).
The book of Hebrews connects death with the consequence of
judgment in close sequence: "just as
is appointed for men to die
once_
and after that comes judgment
(Heb. 9.27). Moreover;
Scripture never represents the final judgment as
depending on
anything done after we die_
but only on what has happened in this
life (Matt. 25.31-46; Rom 2.5-10; cf: 2 Cor: 5.10). Some have
argued for
second chance to believe in the gospel on the basis of
Christ $ preaching
the spirits in prison in
3.18-20 and the
preaching of the gospel
even t0 the dead" in
Peter 4.6
but those
are inadequate interpretations of the verses in question; and_
closer inspection, do not support such
view:
We should also realize that the idea that there will be
second
chance to accept Christ after death is based on the assumption that
everyone deserves
chance
accept Christ and that eternal
punishment only comes
those who consciously decide
reject
him. But certainly that idea
nol
supported by Scripture: we all are
sinners by nature and choice, and no one actually deserves any of
God'$ grace Or deserves any opportunity to hear the gospel of
Christ
those come only because of God's unmerited favor:
Condemnation comes not only because of
willful rejection of
Christ; but also because ot the sins that we have committed and the
rebellion against God that those sins represent (see John 3.18).
The idea that people have
second chance to accept Christ after
death would also destroy most motivation for
evangelism and
missionary activity today; and
not consistent with the intense
missionary zeal that was felt by the New Testament church as
whole_
and that was especially exemplified in the missionary travels
of the apostle Paul:
The fact that there is conscious punishment for unbelievers after
they die and that this punishment goes on forever is certainly
difficult doctrine for uS

into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels,
and he says that "they will go away into eternal punishment; but the
righteous into eternal life
(Malt: 25.41, 46).
These passages show that we cannot accept as faithful to Scripture
the doctrine of annihilationism This is
doctrine that says thar

them and
will no longer be: Although the idea
initially sounds attractive
4S, and
avoids the emotional
difficulty connected with affirming eternal conscious punishment
for the wicked, such an idea is not explicitly affirmed in any
passages of Scripture, and seems S0 clearly to be contradicted by
those passages that connect the eternal blessing of the righteous
with the eternal punishment of the wicked (Matt: 25.46) and that
talk about punishment extending t0 the wicked day and night
forever (Rev: 14.11; 20.10).
Although unbelievers pass into
of eternal punishment
immediately upon death; their bodies will not be raised until the day
of final judgment. On that
their bodies will be raised and
reunited with their souls
and they will stand before God s throne
for final judgment
be pronounced upon them in the body (see
Matt: 25.31-46; John 5.28-29; Acts 24.15; and Rev: 20.12, 15).

Glorification
(Receiving
Resurrection Body)
When will we receive resurrection bodies? What will they be like?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
When Christ redeemed us he did not just redeem our spirits (0r
souls)
he redeemed us as whole persons
and this includes the
redemption of our bodies. Therefore the application of Christ'$
work of redemption tO us will not be complete until our bodies are
entirely set free from the effects of the fall and brought to that state
of perfection for which God created them. In fact; the redemption
of our bodies will only occur when Christ returns and raises our
bodies from the dead
But at this present time_
Paul says that we
wait for
redemption of our bodies,
and then adds, "for in this
hope
we were
saved" (Rom. 8.23-24). The stage in the application
of redemption when we receive resurrection bodies is called
glorification. Referring
that future day Paul says that we will be
glorified with him" (Rom. 8:17). Moreover; when Paul traces the
steps in the application of redemption, the last one he names is
glorification:
And those whom he predestined he also called; and
those whom he called he also justified; and
whom he justified
he also glorified
(Rom. 8.30).
The day
we are
glorified will be
day of great victory because on
that day the last enemy; death; will be destroyed, just as Scripture
predicts: "For he muSt reign until he has put all his enemies under
his feet: The last enemy to be destroyed
death" (1 Cor: 15.25
26) . In the context of
discussion of the resurrection of
bodies
when Christ returns_
Paul says,
Then shall come t0
the saying
that is written:
Death is swallowed up in victory:
0 death, where
is YOur victory? 0 death; where
your sting?'
(1 Cor: 15.54-55).
When our bodies are raised from the dead we will experience
complete victory over the death that came as
result of the fall of
"the
those
our
Pass
Adam and Eve_
Then our redemption will be complete
We may therefore define
glorification as follows: Glorification is
the final step in the application of redemption. It will happen when
Christ returns and raises from the dead the bodies of all believers
for all time who have died, and reunites them
their souls, and
changes the bodies of all believers who remain alive, thereby giving
all believers at the same time perfect resurrection bodies like his
Own.
LtAncr
Walnnhcinmnl
The primary New Testament passage 0n glorification Or the
resurrection of the body is
Corinthians 15.12-58.
Paul says_
also in Christ shall all be made alive
But each in his own order:
Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong
Christ" (vV: 22-23).
Paul discusses the nature of the resurrection
body
some detail
verses 35
50, which we
examine in
section C below. He then concludes the passage by
that nor
all Christians will die
but some who remain alive when Christ
returns
simply have their bodies instantaneously changed into
new; resurrection bodies that can never grow old or weak and can
never die:
Lol
tell you
mystery. We shall not all sleep
but we shall all be
changed, in a moment; in the twinkling of an eye; at the last trumpet:
For the trumpet will sound_
and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we shall be changed. (1 Cor: 15.51-52)
Paul further explains in
Thessalonians that the souls of those who
have died and gone t0 be with Christ will come back and be joined
with their bodies on that day; for Christ
bring them with
since we believe that Jesus died and rose
even 5O,
through Jesus
God will bring with him those who have fallen
(1 Thess. 4.14). But here Paul affirms not only that God
will bring with Christ those who have died; he also affirms that
"the dead in Christ
rise first'
Thess. 4.16). So these
believers who have died with Christ are also raised up to meet
Christ (Paul says in
17, "We
shall be caught up together with
them
the clouds t0 meer the Lord in the air"
This only makes
sense if it is the souls of believers who have gone into Christ'$
presence who retum with him; and if it is their bodies that are raised
with ,

"For

from the dead to be joined together with their souls, and then to
ascend t0 be with Christ:
In addition t0 these passages in
Corinthians 15 and
Thessalonians
several other New Testament passages affirm the
reality of the doctrine of glorification Jesus says,
The hour is
coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come
forth; those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and
those who have done evil to the resurrection of _
judgment" (John
5.28-29).
Jesus also says
"This is the will of him who sent me
that
should lose
nothing of all that he has given me
but raise it up
at the last day For this is the
of my Father; that every one who
sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal
and
Will
raise him up at the last day
(John 6.39-40; cf: vv: 44, 54).
Paul says
who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life
to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you
(Rom: &.11; cf.
Cor: 5.1-10). He realizes that Christians should
live in eager expectation of Christ'$ return and of the change in our
bodies to be like his own perfect body He says, "But
commonwealth is in heaven, and from
await _
Savior; the
Lord Jesus Christ; who will change our lowly body to be like his
glorious body; by the power
which enables him even
subject all
things to himself" (Phil. 3.20).
Old Teatamen Support
Glorficaticn
Sometimes people have claimed that the Old Testament has little if
any evidence of hope in
future resurection of the body; but there
is in fact more Old Testament evidence for this than
might
realize:
even before Jesus was raised from the dead, the New
Testament indicates that many Jewish people living at the time of
Christ had some
future bodily resurrection When Jesus
comes
the home of Lazarus after he had died and says t0 Martha_
"Your brother will rise again;
Martha responds,
know that he
will rise
in the resurrection at the last day" (John 11.23-24).
Moreover; when Paul was on trial, he said t0 Felix that he had
in God which these themselves [his Jewish accusers
accept,
that there will be
resurrection of both the just and the unjust"
(Acts 24.15).
As for the beliefs of those
in the time of the Old Testament;

"He"

Firsl;

Hebrews 11 tells us that Abraham "looked forward to the city
which has foundations_
whose builder and maker is God" (Heb:
11:10) . We also read that many Old Testament saints "all died in
faith, not having received what was promised_
but having seen it
and greeted
from afar; and having acknowledged that
Were
strangers and exiles on the earth_
But as it is, they desire
better
country, that is,
heavenly one
Therefore God is not ashamed t0
be called their God
for he has prepared for them
city" (Heb:
11.13-16). The author even says that Abraham
considered that
God was able t0 raise men even from the dead" (Heb. 11.19).
When we look at the actual
teachings of the Old Testament itself,
there are indications that Old Testament authors had
strong
expectation of the resurrection
come in the future. Job says: "[
know that my Redeemer lives
and that in the end he will stand
upon the earth:
And after mY skin has been destroyed, yet in my
flesh
see God;
myself will
him with my own eyes
and not another" (Job 19.25-26 NIV)
We read in the Psalms
But God
redeem my soul
the
grave; he will surely take me to himself" (Ps. 49.15 NIV; cE: 73.24
25). And we read in Proverbs_
"Do not withhold discipline from
child.
If you beat him with the rod yOu will save his life from
Sheol" (Prov: 23.13-14). Isaiah says,
Your dead shall live , their
bodies shall rise
(Isa. 26.19).
Daniel has
very explicit prophecy
that
many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake;
some t0 everlasting life, and some
shame and everlasting
contempt" (Dan: 12.2). (Cf: also Ezekiel $ vision of the dry bones
in Ezek: 37.1-14.)
Although Old Testament believers certainly did not have as much
detail about the nature of the resurrection or the way
would come
about
through the resurrection of the Messiah, and although
did not have as clear
basis for confidence in the resurrection as
do in the actual event of the bodily resurrection of Christ;
nonetheless there was certainly; as we have seen, an expectation of
future day of bodily resurrection. People who for years had
meditated on and believed these statements of Scripture (such as
Martha in John 11.24) were prepared t0 receive the full-fledged
New Testament
0n the resurection
eagerly; for
simply
provided more detail and more assurance for what they already had
believed:

Like?
If Christ will raise our bodies from the dead when he returns, and if
our bodies will be like his resurection body (1 Cor: 15.20,23
49;
Phil. 3.21) , then what will our resurection bodies be like?
Using the example of sowing
seed in the ground and then
watching
grow into something much more wonderful, Paul goes
on to explain in more detail what our resurrection bodies will be
likez
What is sown is
perishable; what is raised is imperishable: It is SOwn
dishonor;
is raised in glory It is sown in weakness_
it is raised in
power: It is sown
physical body; it is raised
spiritual body
Just
as we have borne the image of the man of dust; we shall also bear the
image of the man of heaven: (1 Cor: 15.42-44,49)
The fact that 0ur new bodies will be "imperishable
means that they
will not
Out 01 grow old 0r ever be subject to any kind of
sickness 0r disease.
will be completely healthy and strong
forever: Moreover; since the
process of aging is part of the
process by which our bodies now are subject to
corruption;
it is
appropriate t0 think that Our resurection bodies will have no sign
of aging-
but will have the characteristics of youthful but mature
manhood 0r womanhood forever: There will be no evidence of
disease or injury; for all will be made perfect:
Our resurrection
bodies will show the fulfillment of God'$ perfect wisdom in
creating
4S as human beings who are the pinnacle of his creation
and the appropriate bearers of his likeness and image_
In these
resurrection bodies we will clearly see humanity as God intended it
Paul also says our bodies will be raised "in glory:
When this term
is contrasted with "dishonor;
aS it is here, there is
suggestion of
the beauty or the attractiveness of appearance that
bodies will
have: They will no longer be
dishonorable" or unattractive_
but
will look
glorious'
in their beauty. Moreover; because the word
glory'
is s0 frequently used in Scripture of the bright shining
radiance that surrounds the presence of God himself, this term
suggests that there will also be
kind of brightness Or radiance
surrounding
bodies that will be an appropriate outward
evidence of the position of exaltation and nule over all creation that
Ila
Wear
They
gradual,
our
God has given t0 uS:
This is also
suggested in Matthew 13.43,
where Jesus says _
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the
kingdom of their Father:
Similarly,
read in Daniel $ vision;
And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the
firmament; and those who turn many t0 righteousness; like the stars
for ever and
(Dan: 12.3
passage talking about the final
resurrection). Now both of these statements might possibly be
understood metaphorically; and in that case
would not indicate
that an actual
brightness
radiance will surround our resurrection
bodies_
But there is nO reason in the context of either of them that
would cause uS
see them as metaphorical, and other pieces of
evidence argue against doing so_
The hints of the age t0 come that
Ua
seen
the shining of the glory of God from the face
Moses
(Ex. 34.35), and_
in a much greater way; the bright light that shone
from Jesus at the transfiguration (Matt:
together with the fact
that we will bear the image of Christ and be like him (1 Cor: 15.49),
combine t0 suggest that there will actually be
visible brightness or
radiance that surrounds US when we are in OuI resurrection bodies.
Our bodies
also be raised "in pOwer" (1 Cor: 15.43). This is in
contrast [0 the "weakness'
which we see in our bodies now: Our
resurrection bodies will not only be free from disease and aging;
they will also be given fullness of strength and power
infinite
power like God;
of course
and probably not what we would think
of as
superhuman
power in the sense possessed by the
superheroes"
in modern fictional children'$ writing: for example_
but nonetheless full and complete human power and strength; the
strength that God intended human
to have in their bodies
when he created them: It will therefore be strength that is sufficient
do all that we desire t0 do in conformity with the will of God.
Finally; Paul says that the body is raised
"spiritual body"
Cor:
15.44). In the Pauline epistles_
the word
spiritual" (Gk
pneumatikos) never means
nonphysical" but rather
consistent
with the character and activity of the Holy Spirit" (see, for example;
Rom: 1.11; 7.14;
Cor: 2.13, 15, 3.1; 14.37; Gal: 6.1 ["you who
are spiritual"]; Eph 5.19). The RSV translation; "It is sown
physical body; it is raised
spiritual body;
is misleading_
and
more clear paraphrase would be; "It is sown
natural body subject
the characteristics and desires of this age
and governed by its
own sinful will, but
raised
spiritual body; completely subject
ever"
they
17.2),
will
beings =
the will of the
Spirit and responsive
the Holy Spirit'$
guidance:
Such
body is not at all
nonphysical,
but it is
physical body raised to the degree of perfection for which God
originally intended it
In conclusion, when Christ returns he will give US new resurrection
bodies to be like his resurrection body. "When he appears we shall
be like him `
John 3.2; this statement
true not only in an ethical
sense but also
terms of our physical bodies; cf:
Cor: 15.49; also
Rom: 8.29).
In spite of this strong New Testament emphasis on the similarity
between our bodies and Jesus' body after the resurrection, some
have objected that we will not have physical bodies because Paul
says,
"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does
the perishable inherit the imperishable" (1 Cor: 15.50). This is in
the
section in which he has been discussing the resurrection of
the dead:
But it is surely
misunderstanding
say that this verse
implies that we shall not have physical
bodies
When Paul says_
"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
what he
means by
flesh and blood" is our present human nature,
particularly our physical bodies_
are nOw
in the
likeness of Adam after the fall
that is, subject t0 weakness, decay;
and ultimate death This is the point he has made in the previous
four verses (1 Cor: 15.45-49), in which he has been contrasting
Adam with Christ: He explains,
As was the man of
SO are
those who are of the dust" (that
we ourselves in this present age
Cor: 15.48). Then he explains_
Just as we have borne the image
of the man of
shall also bear the image of the man of
heaven" (1 Cor: 15.49). By "flesh and blood" here Paul means
"flesh and blood in the present state of existence with
body like
Adam
after the fall,
body that is subject tO decay and death:
does not mean that we shall exist in
nonphysical state; for the
entire heaven and earth will be made new and renewed for US
live in (Rom: 8.18
25),and
ourselves
'shall all be changed, in a
moment; in the twinkling of an eye; at the last trumpet"
Cor:
15.51-52). We will not cease
exist in physical bodies, but we
will be changed and we will have an imperishable body; "For this
perishable nature muSt put on the imperishable, and this mortal
nature must put on immortality" (1 Cor: 15.53).
Moreover; the repeated instances in which Jesus demonstrated tO

the
disciples that he had
physical body that was able t0 be touched;
that had flesh and bones (Luke 24.39), and that could eat food_
show that Jesus' body; which is our pattem; was clearly
physical
body that had been made perfect:
What kind of continuity will there be between our present bodies
and our future resurrection bodies? Will our bodies look exactly the
same and have exactly the same characteristics
or will they be
somewhar
different;
will
be almost entirely different?
Moreover; will Our resurrection bodies be made of the same
molecules of which our earthly bodies consist;
will they be an
entirely new creation from God_
0r will
be some combination
of old and new?
Severab
passages indicate that Paul expected
considerable
measure of continuity between our present earthly bodies and our
future resurrection bodies_
Paul said, "He who raised Christ Jesus
the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his
Spirit which dwells in you" (Rom: 8.11). He said that Jesus
Will
change our lowly body t0 be like his glorious body" (Phil. 3.21).
And when Paul spoke about the nature of the resurrection body he
an example of
seed sown in the ground:
What yOu SOW is
not the body which is to be; but -
bare kernel, perhaps of wheat 0r
of some other
But God gives it
body as he has chosen, and
each kind of seed its own body"
Cor: 15.37-38). In this
example, he draws on common human knowledge that there are
differences between what is sown and what is raised (vV 42-44) ,
but there is also continuity-
-just as
seed grows into
larger plant,
retaining the matter that was in
but taking t0 itself other materials
from the ground as well, So we
have continuity and differences
as well
On this
we can say that whatever remains in the
grave from our own physical bodies will be taken by God and
transformed and used t0 make
new resurrection body. But the
details of how that will happen remain unclear tO us, since Scripture
does not specify them
we are t0 affirm this because Scripture
teaches it, even if we cannot fully explain how it can happen.
Another indication of significant continuity between Our present
bodies and the bodies that we will have is seen in the fact that those
believers who remain alive on the day Christ retums will ~be
thev
they

changed"
~yet their bodies will not be replaced:
We shall not all
sleep
but we shall all be changed, in
moment; in the
twinkling of
an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead
will be raised imperishable_
and we shall be changed. For this
perishable nature muSt put on the imperishable, and this mortal
nature must put on immortality" (1 Cor: 15.51-53).
We must also clearly note that Christ $ Own resurection body;
though it differed somewhat from the body he had before he died,
so that the disciples did not immediately recognize him in every
situation, was similar enough in appearance for the disciples t0
know who
was rather quickly There were some instances when
they did not immediately recognize him
but this may in part be
accounted for by the fact that during his earthly life and ministry he
had no doubt aged considerably; since he was
man of SOITOwS
and acquainted with grief" (Isa. 53.3). After his resurrection, Jesus
would have been restored [0
and perfect strength and
youthfulness of appearance_
Just as we sometimes do nOr
immediately recognize
friend who has
considerably since
the last time we saw him or her; so the disciples may have had
initial difficulty in recognizing Christ because the opposite of aging
had occurred.
On the other hand, significant continuity between
Jesus' body before and after the resurrection
seen in the fact thar
pven
the nail prints in his hands and feet and the wound in his side
remained in his resurrection body (John 20.20,27).
Another piece of evidence indicating continuity between our earthly
and heavenly bodies is the fact that apparently people will
recognize and know one another in heaven. Jesus says that people
will come from east and west and
sit at the table with Abraham;
[saac _
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt: 8.11). Moreover;
Elijah; who had been taken up to heaven in his earthly body; was
somehow recognizable to the disciples on the Mount of
Transfiguration (Luke 9.30,33) of course, the disciples had not
known Elijah or Moses in the flesh;
but somehow these men
retained their personal
identities in such
way that the disciples
believed that they were there and that they were just as real as Jesus
(see Luke 9.33). Finally; Matthew tells us that when Jesus died,
"the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who
had fallen
were raised, and
out of the tombs after his
resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many"
(Malt: 27.52-53). The fact that these people
actual
bodies were
full

raised, and the fact that
appeared t0 many in Jerusalem,
indicates again that there was some continuity between their dead
bodies that were in the graves and the bodies that were raised up.
Since
came OuC of the tombs "after his resurrection'
we may
dSSuMe
that these also were saints who had received resurrection
bodies as
kind of foretaste 0f the final day
glorification when
Christ returns.
The fact that these people "appeared t0 many"
suggests that
were
recognizable
that people knew who they
were_
Again the evidence is suggestive rather than conclusive, yet it
points in the direction of continuity between the body that existed
before the resurrection and the one that existed after ic
There is today some hesitancy on the part of many evangelicals to
affirm clearly that there will be
"resurrection of the body;
Ol ai
least that the body that is raised will be
material, physical body
that is in some way continuous with the body that was placed in the
grave
To some measure
this may be due t0
sense of inability to
understand how God could raise the same bodies from the grave;
especially when some of those bodies had been dead for many
centuries_
Yet some of this hesitancy
probably also due
the
continuing skepticism of unbelievers who challenge the Christian
view with exactly the kind of problems just presented
does this
noL seem
like
fantastic; unbelievable position? How could God
about such
thing?
In both cases
whether the hesitancy comes from the honest
questioning of the believer or from the hostile skepticism of the
unbeliever
we should realize that our inability to understand or
explain something should never be
reason for rejecting it if it is
clearly taught in Scripture: The many passages cited above
indicating that God will raise our mortal bodies from the grave, just
as he raised Jesus"
body from the grave_
indicate quite conclusively
that there will be
definite continuity between our present bodies
and the bodies we have in the resurrection. And if that is what
Scripture teaches, then, even though we may not understand exactly
how God will bring this about in every case
should still believe
The God who created the universe and created each one of uS,
and who sovereignly rules over every bit of this creation at
moment; and who carries
by his word of power; can
certainly
track of the parts of our physical bodies that he
wishes t0 preserve and use as the
seed" from which

It is important t0 insist on the resurrection of
real, physical body;
not only for the reasons above
but also because this provides
clear affirmation of the goodness of God's physical creation
We
will live in bodies that have all the excellent qualities God created
4S to have, and thereby we will forever be living proof of the
wisdom of God in making
material creation that from the
beginning was

believers in those new bodies_
and
will be suitable for

new earth in which

Tha Entire Crraticn Will
When Adam sinned God cursed the ground because of him (Gen.
3.17-19), so that it brought forth thorns and thistles and would only
yield food useful for mankind by painful toil_
But Paul says that
"the creation itself will be set free from its bondage t0 decay and
obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God" (Rom
8.21). He
explains that this will happen when we receive Our resurrection
bodies
he says that the creation is somehow longing for
that
For the creation waits with eager longing for the
revealing of the sons of God_
We know that the whole creation
has been groaning in travail together until nOw; and nOt only the
creation, but we ourselves
who have the first fruits of the Spirit,

(Rom_
8.19,22-23). In this renewed creation_
there

deserts or uninhabitable jungles; no more earthquakes or tornadoes,;
no more poisonous snakes or bees that sting Or mushrooms that kill_
There will be

produce food abundantly for our enjoyment.

Although the emphasis of Scripture
on the fact thar believers Will
experience
bodily resurrection, there are some passages that state
that unbelievers will also be raised from the dead, but that they will
face the final judgment at the time they are raised. Jesus clearly
teaches that "those who have done evil" will come forth "to the

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Paul says that the expectation of
future bodily resurrection is the
~hope'
which we were saved (Rom: 8.24). Is the hope of
tuture
resurection of your body one of the major
you look forward t0 in
the future? [f not; why not? What could increase your
in the future
resurrection of the body?
So strong was Paul's longing for the future day of resurrection, and s0
aware was he of the hardships that we still suffer in this life, that he
could say; "If for this life only we have hoped in Christ; we are of all
MeM mSL
to be pitied" (1 Cor: 15.19), and, "If the dead are not raised
'Let uS eat and drink; for tomorow we die"
(1 Cor: 15.32).
Do you
have
great longing for the future resurection that gives YOu this kind of
sentiment in your heart as well? If nOt; why do yOu not have the same
perspective on the resurrection of the body that Paul did?
What do you think might occur in your life [0 give YOu
greater
for the resurrection of your body? If you have
grandfather or
grandmother
other older friend or relative who has died and
be with Christ, what do You think that
will look like on the day of
resurection? Can YOu imagine what
will be like
that person
and becoming acquainted
How will your relationship be different
from what it was in this life?

HYMN
Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand"
This hymn was written by Henry Alford
New Testament
professor at Cambridge University; England
and one of the greatest
Greek scholars of the nineteenth century. The hymn pictures
thousands of glorified believers streaming through the gates of
heaven on the day of Christ'$ return, and ends with
prayer that
Christ would come back quickly:
Ten thousand times ten thousand in sparkling raiment bright;
The armies of the ransomed saints throng up the steeps of light:
Tis finished, all is finished_
their fight with death and sin:
Fling open wide the
gates
and let the victors in.
What rush of alleluias fills all the earth and skyl
What ringing of
thousand harps bespeaks the triumph nigh!
for which creation and all its tribes
were
made;
0 joy; for all its former woes
thousand-fold repaidl
then what raptured greetings on Canaan
happy shore;
golden _
day;
Whar
severed friendships up where partings are no morel
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle, that brimmed with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless, nor widows desolate:
Bring near thy great salvation, thou Lamb for sinners slain;
Fill up the roll of thine elect; then take thy pow'
and reign:
Appear; desire of nations, thine exiles
for home;
Show in the heav'n thy promised sign; thou Prince and Saviour;
come.

Union With Christ
What does it mean to be "in Christ" or "united with Christ" ?
EXPLANATION AND
SCRIP TURAL
BASIS
Although
have nOw completed our study of the steps in the
application of redemption,
one other
subject is s0 frequently
mentioned in Scripture and s0 wide-ranging in its application
lives thar
deserves
separate treatment here. That is the concept
of union with Christ As we shall see below; every aspect of God $
relationship to believers is in some way connected t0 our
relationship with Christ. From God'$ counsels in eternity
before the world was created
to our fellowship with God in heaven
in eternity future, and including every aspect of our relationship
God in this life
all has occurred in union with Christ. So in
one sense the entire study of the application of redemption could be
included in this subject: However; in this chapter we can simply
summarize the incredible richness of the scriptural idea of union
with Christ_ John Murray says:
Union with Christ has its source in the election of God the Father
before the foundation of the world and has its fruition in the
glorification of the sons of God: The perspective
God's people is
not narow; it is broad and it is long: It is not confined t0 space and
time; it has the expanse of eternity. Its orbit has two foci; one the
electing love of God the Father in the counsels of etemity; the other
glorification with Christ in the manifestation of his glory: The former
has no
beginning; the latter has no end_
Why does the believer
entertain the thought of God $ determinate counsel with such joy?
Why can he have patience in the perplexities and adversities of the
present? Why can he have confident assurance with reference to the
future and rejoice in hope of the glory of God? It is because he cannot
think of past, present; Or future apart from union with Christ.
our
past
wirh
We may define union with Christ as follows: Union with Christ is
phrase used to summarize several different relationships between
believers and Christ; through which Christians receive every benefit
of salvation: These relationships include the fact that we are in
Christ, Christ iS in US,
are like Christ; and we
with Christ
As this definition indicates, four different aspects of our union with
Christ may be specified from the biblical material. We will look at
each of these tour

2. Christ is in uS.
3. We are like Christ.
We are with Christ.

The phrase "in Christ" does not have one
single sense_
but refers [0
variety of relationships, as indicated below:
In God's Eternal Plan: Ephesians 1.4 tells uS
God chose uS in Christ
"before the foundation of the world_
It was "in Christ" that we were
destined and appointed to
for the praise of his glory" (vv: 111-12)
Later he
saved us and called us'
because of
Own
puipose
and because
of the grace which he gave us "in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time
Tim. 1.9 NIV)_
Since we did not exist before the foundation of the world, these
verses indicate thar God;

would exist; thought of us

choose uS and later decide

Christ Rather; while choosing uS_
he at the same time thought
about uS as
belonging to Christ in
special way; as
"in
Christ
Therefore_
he thought about us as eventually having the
right t0 share in the blessings of Christ'$ work.
Christ's Life on Earth: Throughout Christ'$ entire life on earth;
from the time of his birth to the time of his ascension into heaven; God
thought of us as being "in Christ
That is_
whatever Christ did as our

During
being
believers were not consciously present in Christ, since most believers did not
even exist
when Christ was on earth. Nor were believers present in Christ
in some mysterious, spiritual way (as if, for example; the souls of thousands
of believers were somehow present in Christ $ body during his earthly life)
Rather; believers were present in Christ only in God '$ thoughts
God thougnt
of uS as going through everything that Christ went through; because he was
0ur
representative.
When Jesus perfectly obeyed God for his whole life, God thought
of us as having obeyed, too. "By one man"
obedience many will be
made righteous'
(Rom: 5.19). So Christ is our source of
righteousness ( 1 Cor: 1.30; Phil. 3.9).
Because God thought of us as being "in" Christ, he also could think
of our sins as
belonging -
[0 Christ: "God made him who had no sin
be sin for uS
(2 Cor: 5.21 NIV), and "the LORD has laid on him
the iniquity of uS all" (Isa. 53.6). These were sins
had not yet
committed_
but God knew about them in advance_
and
thought of
them as
belonging
Christ. Thus; it was right that Christ should
die for our sins. "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree"
Peter 2.24; see also Rom: 4.25;
Cor: 15.3; Col: 2.14; Heb:
9.28).
But
was nOt just
our sins that God thought of as belonging to
Christ:
was we ourselves
When Christ died, God thought of uS as
having died_
Our old self was
crucified with him `
(Rom. 6.6).
have been crucified with Christ" (Gal. 2.20). "One has died for all;
therefore all have died" (2 Cor: 5.14; see also Rom: 6.4-5, 8; 7.4;
Col: 1.22; 2.12,
20; 3.3;
Tim: 2.11).
In the same way; God thought of us as having been buried with
Christ, raised with him, and taken up t0 heaven with him in glory:
"God raised uS up with Christ and seated US with him in the
heavenly realms in Christ Jesus
(Eph: 2.6 NIV; see also Rom: 6.4-
Cor: 15.22; Col. 2.12-13).
When Christ returned t0 heaven
therefore; all the
salvation were earned for us. God thought of these
being rightfully OurS, just as if we had earned them ourselves_
Nevertheless, they were stored up for uS in heaven
in God $ mind,
actually, and in Christ; OuI representative
to be applied to
personally (1 Peter 1.3-5; Col. 33-4 Eph 1.3)

Our Lives Now. Once we have been born and exist as real people
in the world, our union with Christ can no longer be something just in God $
mind We also must be brought into an actual relationship with Christ through
which the benefits of salvation can be applied to our lives by the Holy Spirit:
The richness of 0ur present life in Christ can be viewed from four slightly
different perspectives:
We have died and been raised with Christ.
2. We have new life in Christ
3. All our actions can be done in Christ
All Christians together are one body in Christ

Paul also writes to believers about their actions "in Christ
reminds the Corinthians, "in the Lord your labor is not in vain" (1
Cor: 15.58). It is "in the Lord" that children are t0 obey their
parents (Eph: 6.1), wives are tO submit to their husbands (Col.

for Christians is that

you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue t0 live in him, rooted
and built up in him" (Col. 2.6-7 NIV) Then Paul will achieve his
life $ goal, t0
present every man mature in Christ" (Col. 1.28).
John similarly encourages believers to
abide in him" (1 John 2.28;
3.6, 24) , echoing Jesus
words_
"He who abides in me; and
in him,
he it is that bears much fruit" (John 15.5).
One Body in Christ: We are not simply in Christ as isolated individual
persons. Since Christ is the head of the body; which is the church (Eph 5.23),
all who are
union with Christ are also related [0 one another in his body:
This joining together makes US
one body in Christ; and individually members
one of another
(Rom: 12.5;
Cor: 10.17; 12.12-27). Thus
"If one member
suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together"
Cor: 12.26). The ties of fellowship are SO strong that Christians may only
marry "in the Lord"
Cor: 7.39). In this body of Christ old hostilities
disappear; sinful divisions among people are broken down, and worldly
criteria of status no longer apply; for "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free; there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in
Christ Jesus'
(Gal: 3.28; cf: Eph: 2.13-22).
Because
we are one
body in Christ, entire churches can be "in
Chrisr" (Gal:
1.22;
Thess. 2.14). And the church universal, the
church made up of all true believers, is collectively united to Christ
husband is united t0 his wife (Eph 5.31-32;
Cor: 6.17).
ure
hope
they
Christ'$ purpose is t0 perfect and cleanse and purify the church, s0
that it might more
completely reflect what he is like and thereby
bring glory to him (Eph: 5.25-27).
Yet another metaphor is used in
Peter 2.4-5, where believers, in
coming
Christ; are said to be like living stones, built into
spiritual house (see also Eph. 2.20-22). Thus_
they are unified and
forever dependent on one another; just as the stones of
building
are united
each other and depend upon each other:
But the boldest
of all is used by Jesus
who prays for
believers
that they may all be one;
even
you, Father; are in me,
and
in YOu, that they also may be in uS
(John 17.21)_
Here Jesus
prays that our unity would be like the perfect unity between the
Father and the Son in the Trinity:
This is
reminder t0 uS that our
unity should be eternal and perfectly harmonious (as God's unity
But this analogy with the members of the Trinity is very important
for another reason:
wams uS
that union with
Christ will ever swallow up our individual personalities. Even
though the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit have perfect and eternal
unity; yet they remain distinct persons. In the same way; even
though we shall someday attain perfect unity with other believers
and with Christ, yet we shall forever remain distinct persons as
well,
with our own individual gifts_
abilities, interests_

circles of personal relationships, preferences, and
desires_

Jesus spoke of

15.5). It is not only true that we are in Christ; he is also in uS

as well as Jews. Therefore, Paul can tell his Gentile readers that
God's mystery is "Christ in YOu, the hope of glory" (Col. 1.27).
It is important t0 maintain
on the basis of these verses_
that there is
analogy
against [
thinking
real, personal dwelling of Christ in us, and that this does not mean
that we merely agree with Christ Or that his ideas are in 4S.
Rather;
he is in us and remains in US through faith (Eph: 3.17; 2 Cor: 13.5).
To overlook this truth would be to neglect the great source of
spiritual strength that we have within us (1 John 4.4). To remember
it destroys our pride, gives uS
constant
dependence
Christ; and gives US great confidence, not in self; but in Christ
working in us (Gal. 2.20; Rom. 15.18; Phil. 413).
This indwelling of Christ affects Our response t0 those in need
Whatever we do [0
Christian brother 0r sister; we do t0
Christ (Matt: 25.40). Keeping Jesus
commandments is an
indication that he is in uS, and the Holy Spirit also bears witness
us that Christ is in us (1 John 3.24).
Amc Like Chrict
A third aspect of union with Christ is OUr imitation of him "Be
imitators of me; as
am of Christ;
writes Paul
Cor: 11:1). John
reminds US, "He who says he abides in him ought t0 walk in the
same way
which he walked"
John 2.6). So union with Christ
implies that we should imitate Christ Our lives ought so t0 reflect
what his life was like that we
bring honor to him in everything we
do (Phil. 1.20).
Thus, the New Testament pictures the Christian life aS one of
striving to imitate Christ in all 0ur actions_
"Welcome one another;
therefore
as Christ has welcomed you
(Rom: 15.7). "Husbands
love your wives_
as Christ loved tne church
(Eph: 5.25). "As the
Lord has forgiven YOu, SO YOu also must forgive
(Col: 3.13). "He
laid down his life for us; and we ought to
down our lives for the
brethren" (1 John 3:16). Throughout our lives_
are [0 run the
race before us, "looking to Jesus
the pioneer and perfecter of our
faith'
(Heb
13.2; see also Eph: 5.2; Phil. 2.5-11;
Thess.
1.6;
John 3.7; 4.17). By contrast; disobedience t0 Christ holds him up in
contempt ( Heb_
6.6).
Our imitation of Christ is especially evident in
suffering: Christians
are called t0 take
suffering patiently; "because Christ also suffered
for Ou; leaving YOu an example, that yOu should follow in his
stepS
Peter 2.21). Paul $
is to "share his [Christ's]
sufferings, becoming like him in his death
(Phil. 3.10; see also 2
feeling "
deep =
help
Jay
goal
Cor: 1.5;, 4.8-11; Heb. 12.3;
Peter 4.13).
Furthermore
suffering is connected with sharing in Christ $
glory when he returns:
suffer with him in order that we may
also be glorified with him" (Rom: 8.17). This is probably because
is through suffering and difficulty that God makes Us more Christ-
like and causes US [0 grow t0 maturity in Christ (James 1.2-4; Heb_
5.8-9).
Als0
since Christ perfectly obeyed his Father even in the
face of great suffering; so
obedience
trust, and patience in
suffering more fully portray what Christ was like, and so bring
more honor t0 him. It gives 4S great comfort tO know that we are
only experiencing what he has already experienced, and that he
therefore understands what we are going through, and listens
sympathetically t0 OUr prayers (Heb 2.18; 4.15-16; 12.11). As the
outcome of
life of obedience
we are able t0 share in Christ'$
glory:
who conquers
will grant hin t0 sit with me on my
throne, as
conquered and sat down with my Father on his
throne
(Rev. 3.21)_
Our imitation
Christ should not be thought of as
mere
mimicking of Jesus
actions
however: The far deeper purpose is
that in
imitating him
we are
becoming more and more like him:
when we act like Christ we become like Christ We grow Up [O
maturity in Christ (Eph 413,15) as we are
changed into his
likeness from one degree of glory to another" (2 Cor: 3.18). The
final result is that we shall become perfectly like Christ; for God
has predestined us
be conformed to the image of his Son'
(Rom: 8.29;
Cor: 15.49), and
when he appears_
shall be like
him
(1 John 3.2).
When this happens
Christ will be fully glorified
in us (2 Thess: 1.10-12; John 17:10).
Yet in all of this
never lose Our individual personhood_
We
become perfectly like Christ, but we do not become Christ; and we
are not absorbed into Christ or lost forever as individuals. Rather;
is we as real individuals who shall
Know as we are known (1
Cor: 13.12); it is we who shall see him as he is (1 John 3.2); it is we
who shall worship him, and see his face_
and have his name on our
foreheads_
and reign with him for ever and ever (Rev 22.3-5).
Just as the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit are exactly like one another
in character (John 14.7,9), yet remain distinct persons_
SO we can
become more and more like Christ and still be distinct individuals
our
"He

with different gifts and different functions (Eph 415-16;
Cor:
12.4-27). In fact; the
like Christ we become, the more truly
ourselves we become (Matt: 10.39; John 10.3; Rev: 2.17; Ps. 37.4).
If we forget this; we will tend t0 neglect the diversity of gifts in the
church and
want to make everyone like ourselves_
We will also
tend t0 deny any ultimale importance for ourselves as individuals
A proper biblical perspective will allow each believer t0 say not
only; "We Christians are important t0 Christ;'

important t0 Christ: he knows my name; he calls me by name_

(John 10.3; Rev 2.17).
Ate With Chrix
1. Personal Fellowship With Christ: Another aspect of union with Christ
concerns our
personal fellowship
him. It makes little difference whether
we say that we are with Christ or that Christ is with us_
for both phrases
represent the same truth: Christ promised, "Where two or three are gathered
in mY name, there am
in the midst of them"
(Matt. 18.20) , and,
am with
You
always_
t0 the close
the age'
(Matt_ 28.20). Once
since Jesus'
human body ascended to heaven (John 16.7; 17.11; Acts 1.9-11), these verses
must
speak of his divine nature
present with us. Yet it is still _
very
personal presence_
in which we work together with Christ (2 Cor: 6.1), we
know him (Phil. 3.8, 10) , we are comforted by him (2
216-17), we are
taught by him (Matt: 11.29), and we live our whole lives in his presence
Cor: 2.10;
Tim: 5.21; 6.13-14; 2 Tim 41) To become
Christian is t0 be
called into the fellowship of [God s] Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" (1 Cor: 1.9).
Yet this fellowship can vary in intensity; since Paul's benediction on
Christians_
"The Lord be with you all" (2 Thess_
3.16; cf: 2 Tim. 4.22) can
only express
hope for still closer fellowship with Christ and
deeper
awareness of his presence.
Furthermore, in some sense yet imperceptible to us, when we come
worship
nOw come into heaven itself; to "innumerable angels
in festal gathering; and to the assembly of the first-bomn who are
enrolled in heaven, and t0
who is God of all, and to the
spirits of just men made perfect, and t0 Jesus, the mediator of_
new covenant" (Heb. 12.22-24). This participation in heavenly
worship is what the Apostles' Creed calls the
communion of
saints,
and what _

now in heaven witness OuI worship and
rejoice in it; and
certainly
implies that we can have
joyful awareness that our praise is being
heard in God $ temple in heaven:
In all our prayers nOW we are heard by Jesus and have fellowship
with him (1 John 1.3), our great high priest; who has entered "into
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf"
(Heb. 9.24; 4.16). Our fellowship with him will be greater yet when
we die (2 Cor: 5.8; Phil. 1.23;
Thess. 5:10), and even greater still
once Jesus returns
Thess. 4.17;
John 3.1). It gives uS great joy
know that Christ actually desires to have us with him (John
17.24).
Our fellowship with Christ also brings us into fellowship with each
other: John writes_
That which we have seen and heard we
proclaim also t0 YOu; SO that YOu may have fellowship with us; and
our fellowship is
the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ" ( 1
John 1.3)
Union With the Father and With the Holy Spirit: This last verse
suggests
final aspect of union with Christ Because we are in union with
Christ in these several relationships_
we also are brought into union with the
Father and with the Holy Spirit: We are in the Father (John 17.21;
Thess:
1:1;
Thess_
1:1;
John 2.24; 4.15-16; 5.20) and in the
Spirit (Rom:
8.9;
Cor: 3.16; 6.19; 2 Tim 1.14). The Father is in uS (John 14.23) and the
Holy Spirit is in uS (Rom. 8.9, 11). We are like the Father (Matt: 5.44-45, 48;
Eph: 4.32; Col. 3.10;
Peter 1:15-16) and like the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8.4-6;
Gal. 5.22-23; John 16.13). We have fellowship with the Father (1 John 133;
Matt: 6.9; 2 Cor: 6.16-18) and with the Holy Spirit (Rom: 8.16; Acts 15.28;
Cor: 13.14; Eph: 4.30).
These additional relationships are not blurred into
distinctionless,
mystical ecstasy; however: Both now and in eternity we relate to the
Father in his distinct role as our heavenly Father; t0 the Son in his
distinct role as our Savior and Lord
and t0 the Holy Spirit in his
distinct role as the Spirit who empowers us and continually applies
[O uS all the benefits of our salvation.

The Church: Its Nature, Its Marks, and Its
Purposes
What is necessary t0 make
church? How can we recognize
true
church? The purposes of the church:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Nature of the Church
Definition: The church is the community of all true believers for all
time. This definition understands the church to be made of all those who are
truly saved. Paul says, "Christ loved the church and
himself up for her"
(Eph: 5.25). Here the term "the church" is used t0 apply to all those whom
Christ died t0 redeem, all those who are saved by the death of Christ. But that
must include all true believers for all time
both believers in the
Testament age and believers in the Old Testament age as well
So great is
God'$ plan for the church that he has exalted Christ to
position of highest
authority for the sake of the church: "He has put all things under his feet and
has made him the head over all
for the church, which is his body; the
fulness of him who fills all in all" (Eph: 1.22-23).
Jesus Christ himself builds the church by calling his people to
himself: He promised,
will build my church" (Matt: 16.18). And
Luke is careful tO tell uS that the growth of the church came not by
human effort alone, but that "the Lord added to their number day by
day those who were
being saved" (Acts 2.47). But this process
whereby Christ builds the church is just
continuation of the
pattern established by God in the Old Testament whereby he called
people to himself to be
worshiping assembly before him: There
are several indications in the Old Testament that God thought of his
people as
church;
people assembled for the purpose of
worshiping God. When Moses tells the
that the Lord said t0
him, "Gather the people to me , that
may let them hear my words_
SO thal
may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the
Gave
New
things
people
they
earth
(Deut: 4.10), the Septuagint translates the word for
gather" (Heb. qahal) with the Greek term ekklesiazo ,
"[0 summon
an assembly;
the verb that is cognate to the New Testament noun
ekklesia,
church:
It is not surprising; then, that the New Testament authors can speak
of the Old Testament people of IsraeE
"church" (ekklesia).
For
example, Stephen speaks of the people of Israel in the wilderess as
"the church (ekklesia) in the wilderness
(Acts 7.38
author $
translation).
And the author of Hebrews quotes Christ as saying that
he would sing praise t0 God in the midst of the great assembly of
God'$ people
heaven: "In the midst of the church (ekklesia)
will
sing praise to you
(Heb: 2.12
author'
translation, quoting Ps:
22.22).
Therefore the author of Hebrews understands the present-day
Christians who constitute the church on earth t0 be surounded by
great
cloud of witnesses
(Heb. 12.1) that reaches back into the
earliest eras of the Old Testament and includes Abel, Enoch, Noah;
Abraham, Sarah, Gideon, Barak; Samson, Jephthah; David, Samuel,
and the prophets (Heb_
11.4-32).
All these "witnesses'
suround the
present-day people of God,
and
seems only appropriate that they;
together with the New Testament people of God, should be thought
of as God'$ great spiritual
assembly" or
church:
Moreover; later
in chapter 12 the author of Hebrews says that when New Testament
Christians worship
come into the presence of "the assembly (lit.
"church;
Gk. ekklesia) of the first-bom who are enrolled in
heaven.
This emphasis is not
surprising in light of the fact that the
New Testament authors see Jewish believers and Gentile believers
alike to be nOw united in the church:
Together they have been made
one
(Eph: 2.14), they are
one new man"
(v 15) and "fellow
citizens
(v 19), and
members of the household of God" (v 19)
Therefore ,
even though there are certainly new privileges and new
blessings that are given t0 the people of God in the New Testament;
both the usage of the term
church" in Scripture and the fact that
throughout Scripture God has always called his
assemble
worship himself, indicate that it is appropriate t0 think of the
church as
constituting all the people of God for all time; both Old
Testament believers and New Testament believers_
people
2. The Church Is Invisible, Yet Visible_
In its true spiritual reality as the
fellowship of all genuine believers
the church is invisible. This is because We
cannot see the spiritual condition of people's hearts
We can see those who
outwardly attend the church; and we can see outward evidences of inward
spiritual change, but we cannot actually see into people
hearts and view
their spiritual state
only God can do that_ This is why Paul says
The Lord
knows those who are his
(2 Tim: 2.19). Even in Our OWn churches and our
Own
neighborhoods, only God knows who are true believers with certainty
and without error: In speaking of the church as invisible the author of
Hebrews
of the
assembly (literally;
church") of the first-born who
are enrolled in heaven'
(Heb: 12.23), and says that present-day Christians
with that assembly in worship_
We can give the following definition: The invisible church is the
church as God sees iL
Both Martin Luther and John Calvin were eager to affirm this
invisible aspect of the church over
the Roman Catholic
teaching that the church was the one visible
organization
that had
descended from the apostles in an unbroken line of succession
(through the bishops of the church) The Roman Catholic Church
had
argued that only in the visible
organization of the Roman
Church could we find the one true church; the only true church:
Even today such
view is held by the Roman Catholic Church
their
Pastoral Statement for Catholics on Biblical
Fundamentalism" issued March 25
1987 , the (United States)
National Conference of Catholic Bishops Ad Hoc Committee on
Biblical Fundamentalism criticized evangelical Christianity (which
it called "biblical
fundamentalism") primarily because
took
people away from the one true church:
The basic characteristic of biblical fundamentalism
thar
eliminates from Christianity the church as the Lord Jesus founded
There is no mention of the historic; authoritative church in
continuity with
and the other apostles
study of the New
Testament
demonstrates the importance of
belonging to the church
started by Jesus Christ: Christ chose Peter and the other apostles as
foundations of his church
Peter
and the other apostles have been
succeeded by the bishop ot Rome and the other bishops, and
the
flock of Christ still has
under Christ;
universal shepherd:
In response to that kind of teaching both Luther and Calvin
speaks
join
against D
Peter
disagreed. They said that the Roman Catholic Church had the
outward form; the organization; but it was just
shell. Calvin
argued that just as Caiaphas (the
priest at the time of Christ)
was descended from Aaron but was no true priest, SO the Roman
Catholic bishops had
descended" from the apostles in
line of
succession but they
were
not true bishops in Christ'$ church_
Because
had departed from the true
preaching of the gospel,
their visible organization was not the true church: Calvin said,
"This pretense of succession is vain unless their descendants
conserve safe and uncorrupted the truth of Christ which they have
received at their fathers
hands, and abide in it.
See what value
this succession has; unless it also include
true and uninterrupted
emulation on the part of the successors!"
On the other hand_
the true church of Christ certainly has
visible
aspect as well. We may use the
following definition: The visible
church is the church as Christians on earth see it: In this sense the
visible church includes all who profess faith in Christ and give
evidence of that faith in their lives_
In this definition we do not say that the visible church is the church
as any person in the world (such as an unbeliever or someone who
held heretical teachings) might see it; but we mean to speak of the
church as it is perceived by those who are genuine believers and
have an
understanding of the difference between believers and
unbelievers
When Paul writes his epistles he writes to the visible church in each
community:
To the church of God which is at Corinth"
Cor:
1.2);
the church of the Thessalonians"
Thess. 1:1); "To
Philemon
and Apphia
and Archippus
and the church in
your house
(Philem: 1-2). Paul certainly realized that there were
unbelievers in some of those churches, some who had made
profession of faith that was not genuine, who appeared to be
Christians but would eventually fall away: Yet neither Paul nor
anyone else could tell with certainty who those people were_
Paul
simply wrote [0 the entire church that met together in any one
place: In this sense,
could say today that the visible church is the
group of people who come
together each week to worship as
church and profess faith in Christ
high
they
The visible church
throughout the world will always include some
unbelievers, and individual congregations will usually include some
unbelievers, because we cannot see hearts as God sees them_
Paul
speaks of "Hymenaeus and Philetus; who have swerved from the
truth
and who
are upsetting the faith of some
(2 Tim. 2.17-18)_
But he is confident that
The Lord knows those who are his" (2
Tim: 2.19)
Paul says with SOITow;
Demas
in love with this
present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica" (2 Tim
4.10).
Similarly, Paul wars the Ephesian elders that after his departure
"fierce wolves will come in among yOu, not
sparing the flock; and
from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse
things, to draw away the disciples after them" (Acts 20.29-30).
Jesus himself warned,
Beware of false prophets, who come t0 You
sheep $ clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will
know them by their fnuits'
(Matt: 7:15-16) . Realizing this
distinction between the church invisible and the church visible,
Augustine said of the visible church,
Many
are without and
many wolves are within.
When we
recognize that there are unbelievers in the visible church;
there
danger that we may become overly suspicious_
We may
begin to doubt the salvation of many tnue believers and thereby
great confusion into the church
Calvin warned against this
danger by saying that we must make
charitable judgment"
whereby we recognize as members of the church all who "by
confession of faith; by example of life
and by partaking of the
sacraments _
profess the same God and Christ with us.
We should
not try to exclude people from the fellowship of the church until
by public sin
discipline upon themselves. On the other
hand, of course, the church should not tolerate in its membership
public unbelievers'
who by profession or life clearly proclaim
themselves to be outside the true church:
3. The Church Is Local and Universal: In the New 'Testament the word
church" may be applied to
group of believers at any level, ranging from
very small group
private home all the way t0 the group of all true
believers in the universal church_
~house church" is called
"church" in
Romans 16.5
greet also the church in their house
Corinthians 16.19
Aquila and Prisca, together with the church
[heir house , send You hearty
sheep
bring
they
bring "
meeting
greetings in the Lord"
The church in an entire city is also called
church"
Cor: 1.2;
Cor: 1:1; and
Thess. 1:1) The church in
region is referred to
church" in Acts 9.31: "So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee
and Samaria had peace and was built up_
Finally, the church throughout
the entire world can be referred t0 as "the church:
Paul says
Christ loved
the church and gave himself up for her" (Eph: 5.25) and says, "God has
appointed in the church first apostles
second prophets
third teachers
Cor: 12.28). In this latter verse the mention of
apostles
who
nOL given
any individual church, guarantees that the reference is t0 the church
universal.
We may conclude that the group of God s people considered at any
level from local
t0 universa_
may rightly be called
church:
We
should not make the mistake of saying that only
church
in houses expresses the true nature of the church; or only
church
considered at
city-wide level can rightly be called
church, or
only the church universa)
can rightly be called by the name
"church " Rather; the community of God'$ people considered at any
level can be rightly called
church.
Metaphors for the Church_
To help us understand the nature of the
church, Scripture uses
wide range of metaphors and images [0 describe t0 US
what the church
like_
There are several family images
-for example_
Paul
views the church as
family when he tells Timothy t0 act as if all the church
members were members of
larger family: "Do not rebuke an older man but
exhort him as YOu would
father;
younger men like brothers, older
women like mothers, younger women like sisters_
in all purity"
Tim. 5.1-
God
our heavenly Father (Eph: 3.14) , and
we are his sons and
daughters, for God says t0 uS
will be
father t0 YOu, and yOu shall be my
sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty" (2 Cor: 6.18). We are therefore
brothers and sisters with each other in God s family (Matt: 12.49-50;
John
3.14-18). A somewhat different family metaphor is seen when Paul refers t0
the church as the bride of Christ He says that the relationship between
husband and wife "refers to Christ and the church" (Eph: 5.32), and he says
that he brought about the engagement becween Christ and the church at
Corinth and that
resembles an engagement between
bride and her
husband-to-be:
betrothed you to one husband, that to Christ
might present
YOu as
pure virgin" (2 Cor: 11:2 NASB)
~here Paul is
forward [0
the time of Christ'$ retum as the time when the church
be presented to
him as his bride
Were
meeting
6eac
looking
Will
In other metaphors Scripture compares the church t0 branches on
vine (John 15.5), an olive tree (Rom: 1:17-24),
field of crops
Cor: 36-9),
building (1 Cor: 3.9) , and
harvest (Matt_ 13.1-30;
John 4.35). The church is also viewed as
new [emple not built
with literal stones but built with Christian people who are
"living
stones'
Peter 2.5) built up on the
cornerstone
who
Christ
Jesus ( 1 Peter 2.4-8).
Yet the church
not only
new temple for
worship of God; it is also
new group of priests_
"holy
priesthood" that can offer
spiritual sacrifices acceptable t0 God" (1
Pet: 2.5). We are also viewed as God $ house:
And we are his
house
(Heb: 3.6).
with Jesus Christ himself viewed as the
"builder"
of the house ( Heb. 3.3) The church
also viewed as
the
pillar and bulwark Of the truth
Tim. 3.15)
Finally; another familiar metaphor views the church as the body of
Christ (1 Cor: 12.12-27). We should recognize that Paul in fact uses
two different metaphors of the human body when he
of the
church: In
Corinthians 12 the whole body
taken as
metaphor
for the church; because Paul speaks of the
ear" and the
eye
and
the
sense of smell" (1 Cor: 12.16-17). In this metaphor; Christ is
not viewed as the head joined t0 the body; because the individual
members are themselves the individual parts of the head_
Christ is
in this metaphor the Lord who is "outside" of that body that
represents the church and is the one whom the church serves and
worships.
But in Ephesians 1.22-23; 4.15-16, and in Colossians 2.19
Paul
uses
different body metaphor t0 refer t0 the church: In these
passages Paul says that Christ is the head and the church is like the
rest of the body; aS distinguished from the head: "We are to grow up
in every way into him who is the head
into Christ;
whom the
whole body; joined and knit together by every joint with which it is
supplied, when each part is
properly; makes bodily growth
and upbuilds itself in love
(Eph: 415-16).
We should not
confuse these two metaphors in
Corinthians 12 and Ephesians
but
them distinct.
The wide range of meraphors used for the church in the New
Testament should remind us not t0 focus exclusively on any one
For example; while it is true that the church is the body of Christ,
must remember that this is only one metaphor among many. If
we focus exclusively on that metaphor we
be likely t0 forget
speaks
from
working
keep
Will [
that Christ
our' Lord
reigning in heaven as
well as the one who
dwells among us. Certainly we should not agree t0 the Roman
Catholic view that the church is the
continuing incarnation" of the
Son of God on earth today: The church is not the Son of God in the
flesh, for Christ rose in his human body; he ascended in his human
body into heaven, and he now reigns as the incamate Christ in
heaven; one who is clearly distinct from the church here on earth:
Each of the metaphors used for the church can help us t0 appreciate
more of the richness of privilege that God has given 4s by
incorporating uS into the church_
The fact that the church is like
family should increase our love and fellowship with one another:
The thought that the church is like the bride of Christ should
stimulate US tO strive for greater purity and holiness, and also
greater love for Christ and submission to him. The image of the
church as branches in
vine should cause
rest in him more
fully: The idea of an agricultura
crop should encourage uS
continue growing in the Christian life and
obtaining for ourselves
and others the proper spiritual nutrients t0 grw The picture of the
church as God $ new temple should increase OuI awareness of
God'$ very presence dwelling in our midst as
#e meel;
concept
of the church as
priesthood should help uS
see more clearly the
delight God has in the sacrifices of praise and
deeds that we
offer t0 him (see Heb. 13.15-16). The metaphor of the church as
the body of Christ should increase our interdependence on one
another and our appreciation of the diversity of gifts within the
body: Many other applications could be drawn from these and other
metaphors for the church listed in Scripture.
The Church and Israel. Among evangelical
Protestants there has been
difference of viewpoint on the question of the relationship between Israel
and
the church: This question was brought into prominence by those who hold to
"dispensational" system of
theology The most extensive systematic
theology written by
dispensationalist; Lewis Speny Chafer'
Systematic
Theology;
points out many distinctions between Israel and the church; and
even berween
believing Israel in the Old Testament and the church in the New
'Testament:
Chafer argues that God has two distinct plans for the two
different groups of people that he has redeemed: God'$ purposes and promises
for Israel
are for earthly blessings_
and they will yet be fulfilled on this earth
at some time in the future.
On the other hand, God's purposes and promises
for the church are for heavenly blessings, and those promises will be fulfilled
The
good
in heaven:
This distinction between the two different groups that God saves
will especially be seen in the millennium; according
Chafer; for at that time
Israel will reign On earth as God $ people and enjoy the fulfillment of Old
Testament promises_
but the church will already have been taken up into
heaven at the time of Christ'$ secret return for his saints ("the rapture
On
this view; the church did not begin until Pentecost (Acts 2).
And it is not right
t0 think of Old Testament believers
with New Testament believers as
constituting one church:
While Chafer'$ position continues t0 have influence in some
dispensational circles
and certainly in more popular preaching_
number of leaders among more recent dispensationalists have not
followed Chafer in many of these points. Several current
dispensational theologians, such as Robert Saucy; Craig Blaising:
and Darrell Bock; refer to themselves as "progressive
dispensationalists_
and they have gained
wide following: They
would not see the church as
parenthesis in God*s plan but as the
first step toward the establishment of the kingdom of God
On_
progressive dispensational view; God does not have two separate
purposes for
Israe
and the church
but
single purpose
-the
establishment of the kingdom of God
in which Israel
and the
church will both share: Progressive dispensationalists would see no
distinction between Israel and the church in the future eternal state,
for all will be part of the one people of God. Moreover; they would
hold that the church will reign with Christ in glorified bodies on
earth during the millennium (see the discussion of the
millennium
chapter 55).
However; there is still
difference between progressive
dispensationalists and the rest of
evangelicalism
point: they
would say that the Old Testament prophecies concerning Israel will
still be fulfilled in the millennium by ethnic Jewish people who will
believe in Christ and live in the land of Israel as
model nation"
for all nations t0 see and learn from. Therefore
would not say
that the church is the
new Israel" 0r that all the Old Testament
prophecies about Israel will be fulfilled in the church; for these
prophecies
be fulfilled in ethnic Israel:
The position taken in this book differs quite
bit from Chafer $
views 0n this issue and also differs somewhat with progressive
dispensationalists_
However;
must be said here that questions
about the exact way
which biblical prophecies about the future
together
they
will .
Yel e
will be fulfilled are,in the nature of the case , difficult t0 decide
with certainty, and it is wise t0 have some tentativeness in our
conclusions on these matters. With this in mind, the following may
be said:
Both Protestant and Catholic theologians outside of the
dispensational position have said that the church includes both Old
Testament believers and New Testament believers in one church or
one body 0f Christ. Even 0n the nondispensational
view,
person
may hold that there will be
future large-scale conversion of the
Jewish people (Rom: 11:12, 15,
23-24, 25-26, 28-31),
yet that
this conversion will only result in Jewish believers becoming
of the one true church of God
they
grafted back into their
own olive tree" (Rom: 11.24).
With regard
this question, we should notice the many
Testament verses that understand the church as the
new Israel" 0r
new
'people of God.
The fact that
Christ loved the church and
himself up for her" (Eph: 5.25) would suggest this. Moreover;
this present church age, which has brought the salvation of many
millions of Christians in the church; is not an interruption Or
parenthesis in God' $ plan
but
continuation of his plan expressed
throughout the Old Testament to call
people to himself: Paul says
"For he is not
real Jew who is one outwardly; nor is true
circumcision
something external and physical. He is
Jew who is
one inwardly; and real circumcision
matter ot the heart; spiritual
and not literal" (Rom: 2.28-29). Paul
recognizes that though there
literal or natural sense in which people who physically
descended
Abraham are t0 be called Jews
there is also
deeper or spiritual sense in which
true Jew"
is one who is
inwardly
believer and whose heart has been cleansed by God.
Paul says that Abraham is not only t0 be considered the father of
the Jewish people in
physical sense. He is also in
deeper and
more true sense "the father of all who believe without being
circumcised
and likewise the father of the circumcised who are
not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith
which our father Abraham had" (Rom: 411-12; cf: vV: 16, 18).
Therefore Paul can say;
nOr all who are descended from Israel
belong
Israel, and not all are children of Abraham because they
are his descendants
it is not the children of the flesh who are the
pant
will
New
gave
from
children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as
descendants" (Rom. 9.6-8). Paul here implies that the true children
of Abraham; those who are in the most true sense "Israel,
not
the nation of Israel by physical descent from Abraham but those
who have believed in Christ: Those who truly believe in Christ are
now the ones who have the privilege of being called
'my
by the Lord (Rom. 9.25, quoting Hos 2.23); therefore_
the church is
now God s chosen people:
This means that when Jewish people
according
the flesh are saved in large numbers at some time in
the future_
they
not constitute
separate people of God or be
like
separate olive tree_
but
will be
back into their
Own olive tree
(Rom: 11:24). Another passage indicating this is
Galatians 3.29: "And if yOu are Christ's_
then you are Abraham's
offspring, heirs according
promise
Similarly; Paul says that
Christians are the
tnue circumcision
(Phil. 3.3)
Far from thinking of the church as
separate group from the Jewish
people, Paul writes to Gentile believers at Ephesus telling them that
were formerly "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,
and strangers [O the covenants of promise
(Eph: 2.12), but that
now they have been "brought near in the blood of Christ" (Eph:
2.13). And when the Gentiles were brought into the church; Jews
and Gentiles were united into one new body. Paul says that God
has made us both one, and has broken down the dividing wall of
hostility
that he might create in himself one new man in place of
the [Wo,
peace; and might reconcile us both to God in
one body through the cross" (Eph. 2.14-16). Therefore Paul can say
that Gentiles are "fellow citizens with the saints and members of the
household of God_
built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets_
Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone
(Eph: 2.19 -_
20). With his extensive awareness of the Old Testament background
the New Testament church, Paul can still say that "the Gentiles
are fellow heirs_
members of the same body" (Eph: 3.6).
The entire
passage speaks strongly of the unity of Jewish and Gentile believers
in one body in Christ and gives no indication of any distinctive plan
for Jewish people ever to be saved apart from inclusion in the one
body of Christ; the church: The church incorporates into itself all
the true people of God_
and almost all of the titles used of God's
people in the Old Testament are in one place or another applied t0
the church in the New Testament.
Hebrews
provides another strong argument for seeing the church
people"
will
they
'gralted
they
making
as the recipient; and the fulfillment, of the Old Testament promises
concerning Israel. In the context of speaking about the new
covenant to which Christians belong; the author of Hebrews gives
an extensive quotation from Jeremiah 31.31-34,in which he says_
"The days will come
says the Lord, when
will establish
new
covenant with the house of Israel and with the house 0f Judah:
This is the covenant that
will make with the house of Israel after
those days, says the Lord:
will put my laws into their minds; and
write them 0n their hearts_
and
will be their God_
and they shall be
my
people'
(Heb. 8.8-10)
Here the author quotes the Lord'$
promise that he will make
new covenant with the house of [srael
and with the house of Judah; and says that that is the new covenant
that has now been made with the church That new covenant is the
covenant of which believers in the church are nOw members. It
seems hard t0 avoid the conclusion that the author views the church
as the tnue Israel of God in which the Old Testament promises
Israel find their fulfillment:
Similarly, James can write
general letter t0 many early Christian
churches and say that he is writing
To the twelve tribes in the
Dispersion'
(James 1:1) This indicates that he is evidently viewing
New Testament Christians as the successors [0 and fulfillment of
the rwelve tribes 0f Israel:
Peter also speaks in the same way From the first verse in which he
calls his readers
'exiles of the Dispersion'
(1 Peter 1.1)
t0 the
next-to-last verse in which he calls the city of Rome "Babylon" (1
Peter 5.13), Peter frequently
of New Testament Christians in
terms of Old Testament imagery and promises given tO the Jews_
This theme comes t0 prominence in
Peter 2.4-10, where
Peter
says that God has bestowed on the church almost all the blessings
promised [0 [srae_
in the Old Testament: The dwelling-place of God
no longer the Jerusalem temple; for Christians are the new
"temple
of God
5). The priesthood able to offer acceptable
sacrifices [0 God is no
longer descended from Aaron_
for Christians
are nOw the tnue "royal priesthood" with access before God's throne
4-5,9). God*s chosen people are no longer said to be those
physically descended from Abraham, for Christians are nOw the
tue
chosen race
The nation blessed by God is no longer
to be the nation of Israel, for Christians are nOw God' $ true
"holy nation"
(v. 9). The people of Israel are no longer said to be
speaks
said
the people of God, for Christians
both Jewish Christians and
Gentile Christians
are nOw
God $ people

What further statement could be needed in order for uS tO say with
assurance that the church has now become the true [srael of God
and will receive all the blessings promised t0 Israel in the Old
Testament?
The Church and the Kingdom of God
What is the relationship between
the church and the kingdom of God? The differences have been summarized
well by George Ladd:
The Kingdom
primarily the dynamic reign or kingly rule of God,
and, derivatively; the sphere in which the rule is experienced
biblical idiom; the Kingdom is not identified with its subjects. They
are the people of God's rule who enter it; live under
and are
governed by it The church is the community of the Kingdom but
never the Kingdom itself. Jesus' disciples
to the
Kingdom as
the Kingdom belongs to them; but they are not the Kingdom The
Kingdom is the rule of God; the church is
society of men:
Ladd goes on t0 summarize five
specific aspects of the relationship between
the kingdom and the church:
The church is not the
kingdom (for Jesus and
the early Christians preached that the kingdom of God was near; not that the
church was near; and preached the
news
of the kingdom; not the good
news of the church: Acts 8.12; 19.8; 20.25; 28.23
31).
The kingdom
creates the church (for as people enter into God s kingdom they become
joined to the human fellowship of the church)
The church witnesses t0 the
kingdom (for Jesus said, "this gospel of the kingdom will be preached
throughout the whole world,
Matt. 24.14). (4) The church is the instrument
of the kingdom (for the
Spirit; manifesting the power of the kingdom;
works through the disciples to heal the sick and cast out demons, as he did in
the
ministry of Jesus: Matt: 10.8; Luke 10:17). (5) The church is the custodian
of the kingdom (for the church has been given the keys of the kingdom of
heaven: Matt: 16.19).
Therefore we should not identify the kingdom of God and the
church (as in Roman Catholic
theology),
nor should we see the
belong [
good
Holy
kingdom of God as entirely future, something distinct from the
church age (as in older dispensational theology_
Rather;
should
recognize that there is
close connection between the
kingdom of
God and the church: As the church proclaims the
news of the
kingdom, people will come into the church and begin t0 experience
the blessings
God' s rule in their
The kingdom manifests
itself through the church; and thereby the future reign of God
breaks into the present (it is
already'
here: Matt: 12.28; Rom:
14.17; and
not
here fully: Matt. 25.34;
Cor: 6.9-10).
Therefore those who believe in Christ will begin
experience
something
of what God s final kingdom reign will be like:
will
know some measure of victory over sin (Rom: 6.14; 14.17), over
demonic opposition (Luke 10.17), and over disease (Luke 10.9).
They will live in the power of the Holy Spirit (Matt: 12.28; Rom_
8.4-17; 14.17), who is the dynamic power of the
kingdom:
Eventually Jesus will return and his kingdom reign will extend over
all creation (1 Cor: 15.24-28).
The "Mark"
Church (Distingui-hina Chinteristics)
There Are 'True Churches and False Churches:
What makes
church
church? What is necessary t0 have
church? Might
group of people who
claim to be Christians become SO unlike what
church should be that they
should no
longer be called
church?
In the early centuries of the Christian church; there was little
controversy about what was
tnue church. There was only one
world-wide church; the
visible'
church
throughout the world, and
that was_
of course
the true church: This church had bishops and
local clergymen and church buildings which everyone could see.
heretics who were found t0 be in serious doctrinal error were
simply excluded from the church:
But at the Reformation
crucial question came up: how can
recognize
true church? Is the Roman Catholic Church
true
church or not? In order t0 answer that question people had t0 decide
what were the "marks
true church, the
distinguishing
characteristics that lead us [0 recognize
true church Scripture
certainly speaks of false churches_
Paul says of the pagan temples in
Corinth; "What pagans sacrifice they offer t0 demons and not to
God" (1 Cor: 10.20). He tells the Corinthians that
when YOu were
heathen; you were led astray to dumb idols" (1 Cor: 12.2)
These
good
lives-
yet"
they
coming
An
Any
pagan temples were certainly false churches or false religious
assemblies Moreover; Scripture speaks of _
religious assembly that
really
'synagogue of Satan'
(Rev: 2.9; 3.9). Here the risen Lord
Jesus seems t0 be
referring to Jewish assemblies that claim to be
Jews but were not true Jews who had saving faith. Their religious
assembly was not an assembly of Christ $ people but of those who
still
belonged to the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan.
This also would certainly be
false church:
In large measure there
agreement between Luther and Calvin
on the question of what constituted
true church:
The Lutheran
statement of faith, which is called the
Augsburg Confession (1530),
defined the church as "the congregation of saints in which the
gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments rightly administered"
(Article 7).
Similarly; John Calvin said, "Wherever we
Word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments
administered
according
Christ' $ institution, there
it is not t0 be
doubted,
church of God exists_
Although Calvin spoke of the
pure
preaching of the Word (whereas the Lutheran Confession
spoke of the right preaching of the gospel) and although Calvin said
that the Word must not only be preached but heard (whereas the
Augsburg Confession merely mentioned that
had to be rightly
taught), their understanding of the distinguishing marks of
[rue
church is quite similar:
In contrast t0 the view of Luther and
Calvin regarding the marks of
church; the Roman Catholic
position has been that the visible church that descended from Peter
and the apostles is the true church:
seems
appropriate that we take Luther and Calvin's view on the
marks of
true church as correct still today Certainly if the Word
of God is not
preached, but simply false doctrines or
doctrines of men, then there is no tnue church
In some cases
might have difficulty determining just how much wrong doctrine
can be tolerated before
church can no
longer be considered
tnue
church, but there are many clear cases where
we can say that
true
church does nOr exist: For example_
the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter
Saints (the Mormon Church) does not hold to any major
Christian doctrines
concerning salvation
the person of God or the
person and work of Christ: It is clearly
false church: Similarly, the
Jehovah s Witnesses teach salvation by works, not by trusting in
Jesus Christ alone_
This
fundamentab
doctrinal deviation
being
Day
because if people believe the
of the Jehovah's Witnesses,
they simply will not be saved. So the Jehovah
Witnesses also
must be considered
false church: When the preaching of
church
conceals the gospel message of salvation by faith alone from its
members, so that the gospel message
not clearly proclaimed, and
has not been proclaimed for some
the group meeting there is
not
church:
The second mark of the church; the right administration of the
sacraments (baptism and the Lord'$ Supper) was probably stated in
opposition
the Roman Catholic view that
grace came
through the sacraments and thereby the sacraments were made
works" by which we earned merit for salvation
In this way; the
Roman Catholic Church was insisting 0n payment rather than
teaching faith
the means of
obtaining salvation:.
But another reason exists fOr including the sacraments as
mark of
the church Once an organization begins t0 practice baptism and the
Lord's Supper; it is
continuing organization and
attempting [0
function as
church: (In modern American society; an organization
that begins
meet for worship and prayer and Bible teachings on
Sunday mornings also would clearly be attempting
function as
church:)
Baptism and the Lord' $
also serve as "membership
controls'
for the church: Baptism is the means for
admitting people
into the church; and the Lord's Supper is the means for allowing
people t0 give
sign of continuing in the membership of the church
tthe church signifies that it considers those who receive baptism
and the Lord s Supper o be saved: Therefore these activities
indicate whar
church thinks about salvation; and they are
appropriately listed as
mark of the church today as well
contrast, groups who do not administer baptism and the Lord '$
Supper signify that
are nOL
intending to function a5
church
Someone may stand on
street comer with
small crowd and have
true preaching and
of the Word
but the people there would
not be
church:
Even
neighborhood Bible study
home can have the true [eaching and hearing of the Word without
becoming
church
But if
local Bible study began baptizing its
own new converts and
regularly participating in the Lord $ Supper;
these
would signify an intention
function as
church; and
would be difficult tO say why
should not be considered

2. True and False Churches Today: In view of the question posed during the
Reformation_
what about the Roman Catholic Church today? Is it
true
church? Here
seems that we cannot simply make
decision regarding the
Roman Catholic Church as
whole_
because it is far tOO diverse. To ask
whether the Roman Catholic Church is
tnue church or
false church today
somewhat similar to asking whether Protestant churches are true or false
roday
there is great variety among them. Some Roman Catholic parishes
certainly lack both marks: there is no pure preaching of the Word and the
gospel message of salvation by faith in Christ alone is not known Or received
by people in the parish. Participation
the sacraments
seen as
that can
eamm
merit with God. Such
group of people
not
true Christian
church On the other hand, there are many Roman Catholic parishes in
various parts of the world today where the local priest has
genuine
knowledge of Christ and
vital personal relationship with Christ in prayer
and Bible study. His own homilies and private teaching of the Bible place
much emphasis on personal faith and the need for individual
Bible
and prayer: His teaching on the sacraments emphasizes their symbolic and
commemorative aspects much more than
them as acts that merit
some infusion of saving grace from God
In such
case; although we would
have t0 say that We still have profound differences with Roman Catholic
reaching on some doctrines
nonetheless_
seem thar such
church
would have
close enough approximation tO the two marks of the church that
it would be hard t0 deny that it is in fact a tnue church. It would seem t0 be
genuine congregation of believers
which the gospel is taught (though not
purely) and the sacraments are administered more rightly than wrongly:
Are there false churches within Protestantism? If we
look at
the two distinguishing marks of the church, in the judgment of this
present writer
seems appropriate t0 say that many liberal
Protestant churches are in fact false churches today:
Is the gospel
of works-righteousness and unbelief in Scripture that these
churches teach any more likely to save people than did Roman
Catholic teaching at the time of the Reformation? And is not their
administration of the sacraments without sound teaching t0 anyone
who walks in the door likely to give as much false assurance to
unregenerate sinners as did the Roman Catholic use of the
sacraments at the time of the Reformation? When there is an

Lumc
We can understand the purposes of the church in terms of ministry
God, ministry t0 believers
and ministry t0 the world.
Ministry
God: Worship_
In relationship to God the church's purpose is
worship him. Paul directs the church at Colossae tO
psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God" (Col.
3.16). God has destined us and appointed us in Christ "to live for the praise of
his glory" (Eph: 1:12). Worship in the church is not merely
preparation for
something else: it is in itself
fulfilling the major purpose of the church with
reference [0 its Lord_
That is why Paul can follow an exhortation that we are
'making the most of the time
with
command to be filled with the
Spirit and then to be "singing and making melody t0 the Lord with all your
heart" (Eph: 5.16-19)
Ministry
Believers: Nurture: According to Scripture
the church has an
obligation tO nurture those who are already believers and build them up to
maturity in the faith_
Paul said that his Own
was not simply to bring
people
initial saving faith but tO
present
man mature in Christ'
(Col. 1.28). And he told the church at Ephesus that God
the church
gifted persons
'to equip the saints for the work of
for building up the
of Christ; until we all attain t0 the unity of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood
[0 the measure 0f the
stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph. 412-13). It is clearly contrary t0 the
New Testament pattern to think that our only
with people is to bring
them to initial saving faith.
Our
church must be t0 present to God
every Christian
mature in Christ" (Col. 1.28).
3. Ministry t0 the World: Evangelism and Mercy Jesus told his disciples
that they should
make disciples of all nations'
(Matt 28.19). This
evangelistic work of declaring the gospel is the primary ministry that the
church has toward the world
Yec
accompanying the work of evangelism
also
ministry of mercy;
ministry that includes caring for the poor and
needy in the name of the Lord. Although the emphasis of the New Testament
is on giving material help to those who are part of the church (Acts 11.29;
Cor: 8.4;
John 3.17) , there
still an affirmation that it is right to help
sing `
goal
every
Eave
minisuy;
body
goal
goal
unbelievers even if
do not respond with
gratitude
acceptance of the
gospel message. Jesus tells us,
Love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in
retum; and your reward will be great; and yOu will be sons of the
Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish: Be
merciful, even as your Father is merciful. (Luke 6.35-36)
The point of Jesus' explanation
that we are [0 imitate God in
kind t0
those who are being
and selfish as well:
we have the
example of Jesus who did not attempt t0 heal only those who accepted him as
Messiah:
Rather; when great crowds came to him; "he laid his hands on every
one of them and healed them'
(Luke 4.40). This should give US
encouragement
canry out deeds 0f kindness, and
pray for healing and
other needs
the lives of unbelievers as well
believers
Such ministries of
mercy t0 the world may also include participation in civic activities 0r
attempting t0 influence governmental policies t0 make them more consistent
with biblical moral principles:
In areas where there is systematic injustice
manifested in the treatment of the poor andor ethnic Or religious minorities_
the church should also pray and
has opportunity
speak
against such
injustice_
All of these are ways in which the church can supplement itS
evangelistic ministry to the world and indeed adorn the gospel that it
professes.
But such ministries of mercy t0 the world should never become
substitute for genuine evangelism or for the other areas of ministry
God
and to believers mentioned above:
Keeping These Purposes in Balance:
Once we have listed these three
purposes for the church someone might ask; Which is most important? Or
someone else might ask; Might we neglect one of these three as less important
than the others?
To that we must respond that all three purposes of the church are
commanded by the Lord in Scripture; therefore all three are
important and none can be neglected In
strong church will
have effective ministries in all three of these areas_
We should
beware of any attempts t0 reduce the purpose of the church tO only
one of these three and to say that it should be our primary focus. In
such attempts tO make one of these purposes primary will
always result in some neglect of the other Lwo.
church that
emphasizes only worship will end up with inadequate Bible
teaching of believers and its members will remain shallow in their
understanding of Scripture and immature
their Christian lives. If
they
being
ungrateful
Moreuver;
facl;
fact;
it also begins to neglect evangelism the church will cease [0 grow
and influence others;
become ingrown and eventually begin
wither:
A church that places the edification of believers as
purpose that
takes precedence over the other two will tend to produce Christians
who know much Bible doctrine but have spiritual dryness in their
lives because
know little of the joy of
worshiping God or
relling others about Christ
But
church that makes evangelism such
priority that it causes
the other two purposes t0
neglected will also end up with
immature Christians who emphasize growth in numbers but have
less and less genuine love for God expressed in their worship and
less and less doctrinal maturity and personal
holiness in their lives
All three purposes must be emphasized continually in
healthy
church
However; individuals are different from churches in placing
relative priority 0n one or another of these purposes of the church_
Because
we dre
like
body with diverse spiritual gifts and abilities,
it is right for US
place most of our emphasis on the fulfillment of
that purpose of the church that is most closely related to the gifts
and interests God has given
uS. There
certainly no obligation
for
believer to attempt to give exactly one third of his or her
time in the church to worship; one-third to
nurturing other
believers
and one-third to evangelism Or deeds of mercy Someone
with the gift of
evangelism should of course spend some time in
worship and
for other believers_
but may end up
spending the
vast majority of his or her time in
evangelistic work
Someone who
gifted worship leader may end up devoting 90 percent of his
time in the church toward preparation for and leading of worship
This is only an appropriate response t0 the diversity of gifts that
God has given uS_
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL
APPLICATION
When you think of the church as the invisible fellowship of all true
believers throughout all time_
how does it affect the way you think of
as an individual Christian? In the community in which you
is there much visible unity among genuine believers (that is, is there
much visible evidence of the tnue nature of the invisible church)? Does
the New Testament say anything about the ideal size for an individual
Will

church?
Would you consider the church that You are nOW in to be
true church?
Have YOu ever been
member 0f
church that YOu would think to be
false church? Do you think there is any harm done when evangelical
Christians continue
give the impression that they think liberal
Protestant churches are tnue Christian churches? Viewed from the
perspective of the final judgment; what good and what harm might come
from our failure t0 state that we think unbelieving churches are false
churches?
Did any of the metaphors for the church give YOU
new
appreciation for
the church that you currently attend?
To which purpose of the church do you think You can most effectively
contribute? Which purpose has God placed in your heart
strong desire
to fulfill?

"The Church's One Foundation"
The church $ one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She
his new creation by water and the Word:
From heav'n he came and sought her to be his holy bride;
With his own blood he bought
and for her life he died_
Elect from ev'ry nation, yet one 0'er all the earth;
Her charter of salvation one Lord
one faith; one birth;
One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food,
King:
equip
her,
And tO one hope she presses, with evry grace endued
Though with
scornful wonder men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder; by heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping; their cry goes up, "How long?"
And soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song:
The church shall never perish! Her dear Lord to defend,
sustain and cherish, is with her to the end;
Though there be those that hate her; and false sons in her pale;
Against or foe or traitor she ever shall prevail:
Mid toil and tibulation, and tumult of her war;
She waits the consummation of peace forevermore;
Til with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blest;
And the great church victorious shall be the church at rest:
Yet she on earth hath union with God the Three in One_
And
sweet communion with those whose rest
won:
happy ones and holy! Lord, give US grace that we,
Like them; the meek and lowly; on high may dwell with thee:

Chapter 45
The Purity and Unity of the Church
What makes
church more or less pleasing to God? What kinds of
churches should we cooperate with or join?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
More
Pure and Lese
Pure Churches
In the previous chapter we saw that there are
true churches'
and
"false churches:
In this chapter
further distinction must be made:
there are more pure and less pure churches_
This fact is evident from
brief comparison of Paul'$ epistles.
When we look at Philippians or
Thessalonians we find evidence
of Paul'$ great joy in these churches and the relative absence of
major doctrinal or moral problems (see Phil: 1.3-11; 410-16;
Thess. 1.2-10; 36-10;
Thess: 1.3-4; 2.13; cf: 2 Cor: &.1-5). On
the other hand, there were all sorts of serious doctrinal and moral
problems in the churches of Galatia (Gal 1.6-9; 3.1-5) and Corinth
(1 Cor: 3.1-4; 4.18-21; 5.1-2,6; 6.1-8; 11:17-22; 14.20-23;
15.12;
Cor: 1.23-2.11; 1133-5,12-15; 12.20-13.10). Other
examples could be given; but it should be clear that among true
churches there are less pure and more pure churches:
This may be
represented as in figure 45.2

urin
We may define the purity of the church as follows: The purity of the
church is itS degree of freedom from wrong doctrine and conduct;
and its degree of conformity t0 God $ revealed will for the church
As we shall see in the
following discussion, it is right to pray and
work for the greater purity of the church: But purity cannot be our
only concem;
Christians would have
tendency (0 separate into
tiny groups of very
pure
Christians and tend t0 exclude anyone
who showed the slightest deviation in doctrine or conduct of life.
Therefore the New Testament also speaks frequently about the need
to strive for the unity of the visible church: This may be defined in
the
following way: The unity of the church is its degree of freedom
from divisions among true Christians
The definition specifies
true Christians'
because_
aS we saw in the
previous chapter; there are those who are Christian in name only;
but have had no genuine experience of regeneration by the Holy
Spirit: Nonetheless
many of these people take the name "Christian"
and many churches that are filled with such unbelievers still call
themselves Christian churches
We should not expect or work for
organizationa)
functional unity that includes all of those people
and therefore there will never be unity with all churches that call
themselves
Christian:
shall also see in the
following
discussion, the New Testament certainly encourages US
work for
the unity of all true believers _
Church
Factors that make
church "more pure
include:
Biblical doctrine (or right preaching of the Word)
Proper use of the sacraments (or ordinances)
Right use of church discipline
Genuine worship
Effective prayer
Effective witness
Effective fellowship
Biblical church government
9. Spiritual power
ministry
Bul;
Personab
holiness of life among members
11. Care for the poor
12. Love for Christ
There may be other signs than these
but at least these can be
mentioned as factors that increase
church's conformity to God's
purposes
Of course
churches can be more pure in some areas and
less pure
others
church may have excellent doctrine and
sound preaching; for example_
dismal failure in witness t0
others or in meaningful worship:
church may have
dynamic
witness and very God-honoring times of worship but be weak in
doctrinal
understanding and Bible teaching_
Most churches will tend t0 think that the areas in which
are
strong are the most important areas, and the areas where they are
weak are less important But the
Testament encourages US t0
work for the purity of the church in all of these areas
Christ'$
for the church is
that he might sanctify
having cleansed her by
the washing of water with the word
that he mignt present the
church to himself in splendor; without spot or wrinkle
any such
thing, that she might be holy and without blemish" (Eph: 5.26-27)_
Paul'
ministry was one of
warning every man and teaching every
man in all wisdom; that
we may present
every man mature in
Christ" (Col. 1.28). Moreover; Paul told Titus that elders must "be
able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those
who contradict it" ( Titus 1.9), and he said that false teachers
mus
be silenced" (Titus 1:11). Jude urged Christians to
contend for the
faith which was once for all delivered t0 the saints
(Jude 3). Proper
use of the sacraments is commanded in
Corinthians 1:17-34, and
right use of church discipline to protect the purity of the church is
required in
Corinthians 5.6-7,12-13.
The New Testament also mentions
number of other factors: We
t0 strive for spiritual worship (Eph 5.18-20; Col. 3.16-17),
effective witness (Matt: 28.19-20; John 13.34-35; Acts 2.44-47;
John 4.7) , proper government of the church (1 Tim. 3.1-13),
spiritual
power
ministry (Acts 1.8; Rom: 1.16;
Cor: 4.20;
Cor: 10.3-4; Gal. 33-5; 2 Tim. 3.5; James 5.16), personal holiness
Thess. 4.3; Heb: 12.14) , care for the poor (Acts 4.32-35; Rom:
15.26; Gal. 2.10), and love for Christ (1 Peter 1.8; Rev: 2.4). In
Yel =

New

her;
all Christians are t0
strive to excel in building up the church"
Cor: 14.12),an exhortation that applies not only to an increase in
the number 0f church members_
but also (and in fact primarily) t0
the
edification
growth of the church toward Christian maturity:
The force of all of these passages is to remind 4s that we are to
work for tne purity 0f the visible church:
Of course, if we are t0 work for the purity of the church; especially
of the local church of which we are
part;
must recognize that
this is
process, and that any church of which we are
part will be
somewhat impure in various areas:
There were no
perfect churches
at the time of the New Testament and there will be no perfect
churches until Christ returns_
This means that Christians have no
obligation to seek the purest church
find and stay there;
and then leave it if an even purer church comes to their attention:
Rather; they should find
true church in which they can have
effective ministry and in which
will experience Christian
growth as well, and then should stay there and minister; continually
working for the purity of that church:
God will often bless their
prayers and faithful witness and the church will gradually grow in
many areas of purity.
But we must realize that not all churches
respond well t0
influences that would bring them to greater purity. Sometimes, in
spite of
few faithful Christians within
church; its dominant
direction will be set by others who are determined to lead it on
another course: Unless God graciously intervenes to bring
reformation; some of these churches will become cults_
and others
will just die and close their doors
But more commonly these
churches will simply drift into liberal Protestantism:
It is helpful at this point to remember that classical liberal
Protestantism is humanistic, and its approaches are primarily man-
centered rather than God-centered:
When
church begins
stray
from faithfulness to Christ; this will be evident not only in the shift
[0 impure doctrine
(which can sometimes be concealed from church
members by the use of evasive language)
but also in the daily life
of the church: its activities, its
preaching
counseling; and even
the casual conversations among members will tend to become more
and more man-centered and less and less God-centered. There
tend to be
repeated emphasis on the typical kinds of self-help
fact;
they
they
will ;
Will
advice given in popular journals and by secular psychologists_
There will be
horizontal orientation as opposed t0
vertical or
God-centered orientation, there
be fewer and fewer extended
times of prayer and less and less emphasis on the direct application
of Scripture to daily situations, but more emphasis on simply being
caring and sensitive person, and on affirming others and acting in
love toward them: The conversation and activities of the church
will have very little genuine spiritual content
-little emphasis on
the need for daily prayer for individual concerns and for
forgiveness of sins, little emphasis on daily personal reading of
Scripture, and little emphasis on moment-by-moment trust in Christ
and knowing the reality of his presence in our lives:
Where there
admonitions
moral reformation, these
often be viewed as
human deficiencies that people can correct by their Own discipline
and effort; and perhaps encouragement from others, but these moral
aspects of life will not primarily be viewed as sin against
holy
God, sin which can only effectively be overcome by the power of
the Holy Spirit
within. When such humanistic emphases
become dominant in
church; it has moved far toward the "less -
end of the scale in many
the areas listed above, and it is
in the direction of becoming
false church:
New TetnE
Teaching
of the Church
There is
strong emphasis in the New Testament on the unity of the
church: Jesus"
is that "there shall be one flock; one shepherd-
(John 10.16), and he prays for all future believers "that
may all
be one
(John 17.21). This unity will be
witness t0 unbelievers_
for Jesus prays "that they may become perfectly one, so that the
world may know thatyou have sent me and have loved them even
as you have loved me'
(John 17.23).
Paul reminds the Corinthians that they are
called to be saints
together with all those who in every place call on the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours
Cor: 1.2). Then Paul
writes t0 Corinth,
appeal
t0 you; brethren; by the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ; that all of you agree and that there be no
dissensions among you_
but that you be united in the same mind
and the same judgment"
Cor: 1.10; cf v 13).
He encourages the
Philippians,
complete my joy by being of the
same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one
Will
will

they
mind'
(Phil. 2.2). He tells the Ephesians that Christians are t0 be
eager t0 maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace'
(Eph. 4.3), and that the Lord gives gifts to the church "for building
up the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith and
of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, tO the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph 412-13).
Paul can command the church t0 live in unity because there already
is an actual spiritual unity in Christ which exists among genuine
believers_
He says;
There is one body and one Spirit; just as YOU
were called t0 the one
that
belongs to your call, one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all, who is above all
and through all and in all" (Eph 44-6). And though the body of
Christ consists of many members
those members are all
one
body
Cor: 10:17; 12.12-26).
Because they are jealous to protect this unity of the church;_
New Testament writers give strong
those who
cause divisions:
appeal tO yOu, brethren_
t0 take note of those who create dissensions
and difficulties, in opposition t0 the doctrine which you have been
taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ; but
their Own
appetites_
(Rom: 16.17-18)
Paul opposed Peter to his face because he separated from Gentile Christians
and
began eating only with Jewish Christians (Gal. 2.11-14). Those who
promote
strife
dissension_
party spirit
shall not inherit the kingdom of
God" (Gal. 5.20-21). And Jude warns that those who
set up divisions"
are
"worldly people; devoid of the Spirit" (Jude 19).
Consistent with this New Testament emphasis on the unity of
believers is the fact that the direct commands t0 separate from
other people are always commands to separate from unbelievers,
from Christians with whom one
disagrees_
When Paul says_
"Therefore come out from them; and be separate from them:
Cor: 6.17), it is in support of his
opening command of that section_
"Do not be mismated with unbelievers
(2 Cor: 6.14). And Paul
tells Timothy that he is t0
avoid such people'
(2 Tim.
referring not to believers but tO unbelievers
those who are "lovers
of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding the form of religion
but denying the power of it" (2 Tim. 3.4-5). He says that these
hope
warnings
Jgainst _
3.5).
people are
men of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith" (2 Tim: 3.8).
Of course, there is
kind of church discipline that requires
separation from an individual who is causing trouble within the
church (Matt: 18.17;
Cor: 5.11-13), and there may be other
reasons for which Christians conclude that separation is required,
but it is important t0 note here, in
discussing the unity of the
church, that there are no direct New Testament commands t0
separate from Christians with whom one has doctrinal differences
(unless those differences involve such serious heresy that the
Christian faith itself is denied)
These passages on church unity tell us that; in addition to working
for the purity of the visible church;
we are also to work for the unity
of the visible church: Yet we must realize that such unity does not
actually require
worldwide church goverment over all
Christians. In
the unity of believers is often demonstrated quite
effectively through voluntary cooperation and affiliation among
Christian groups_
Moreover; different types of ministries and
different emphases in ministry may result in different organizations_
all under the universal headship of Christ as Lord of the church:
Therefore the existence of different denominations
mission boards_
Christian educational institutions_
college ministries_
and s0 forth is
necessarily
mark of disunity of the church (though
some
cases
may be); for there may be
great deal of cooperation and
frequent demonstrations of unity among such diverse bodies as
these_
think the modern term parachurch organization is
unfortunate; because it implies that these organizations are
somehow "beside
and therefore
outside of" the church; whereas
in reality they are simply different
parts of the one universal
church ) Moreover; many Christians argue that there should not be
worldwide government of the church, because the New Testament
pattern of church government never shows elders having authority
over any more than their own local congregations (see chapter
even in the New Testament the apostles agreed that Paul
should emphasize missionary work t0 the Gentiles while Peter
would emphasize missionary work t0 the Jews (Gal. 2.7), and Paul
and Barnabas went their separate ways for
time because 0f
disagreement over whether
should take Mark with them (Acts
15.39-40), though certainly they had unity in every Other way:

There are sometimes reasons why the outward or visible unity of
the church cannot be maintained
brief survey of the history of
organizationa)
separation in the church may highlight some of these
reasons;
and help explain where present-day denominational
divisions came from_
During the first thousand years of the church there was for the mOst
part outward unity. There had been some minor divisions during
controversies with groups like the Montanists
second century) and
the Donatists (fourth century), and there was
minor separation by
some Monophysite churches (fifth and sixth centuries), but the
prevailing sentiment was
of strong opposition t0 division in the
body of Christ For example, lrenaeus;
second century bishop,
said about those who cause divisions in the church; "No
reformation able to be effected by them will be of great enough
importance
compensate fOr the damage arising
their
schism" (Against Heresies 4.33.7).
The first major division in the church came in AD: 1054 when the
Eastern (now Orthodox) church separated from the Westemn
(Roman Catholic) church: The reason was that the pope had
changed
church creed simply on his Own authority, - and the
Eastern church protested that he had no right t0 do that:
The Reformation in the sixteenth century then separated the
Western church into Roman Catholic and Protestant branches_
yel
there was often
strong reluctance t0 cause formal division. Martin
Luther wanted [0 reform the church without
it, buc he

cated
1521. The Anglican (Episcopalian) church did
separate from Rome; but was excommunicated in 1570; thus it
can say; "We suffer schism;
did not cause it.
On the other hand,
there were many Protestants, especially among the Anabaptists,
who wanted to form churches of believers only; and began as early
as 1525 t0 form separate churches in Switzerland and then other
parts of Europe.
In the centuries following the Reformation; Protestantism splintered
into hundreds of smaller groups. Sometimes leaders of the new
groups regretted such divisions: John Wesley; although he was the
founder of Methodism, claimed that he lived and died
member of
the Anglican church:
was often the case that matters of
from
dividing
conscience or religious freedom forced the division_
as with the
Puritans and many Pietist groups_
On the other hand, sometimes
language differences among immigrant groups in America
ed [0
the
founding of separate churches_
Have the reasons for separation into different organizations and
denominations always been proper ones? Although there have
almost always been strong theological differences in major church
divisions
one fears that too often; especially in more recent
the real motives for beginning or maintaining separation have been
selfish ones
and that John Calvin may have been correct in saying;
"Pride or self-glorification

point of all
controversies;
when each person
claiming for himself more than he
is entitled t0

eager to have others in his power:
Moreover;
he says;
Ambition has been, and still is, the mother of all errors, of
all disturbances and sects_
In the mid-twentieth century the ecumenical movement sought
greater organizational unity among denominations
but without
noteworthy success. It by no means received wholehearted approval
or support from
evangelicals_
On the other hand_
since the 1960s_
the growth of the charismatic movement across almost all
denominational lines, the rise of neighborhood Bible study and
prayer groups_
and
greatly diminished doctrinab
awareness among
people_
have brought about
remarkable increase in actual
unity of fellowship
eveM
between Protestants and Catholics
the local level:
Although the previous paragraphs spoke of separation in the sense
of (1) the formation of separate organizations, there are two other;
more severe kinds of
separation that should be mentioned: (2
"No
cooperation
in this case
church or Christian organization
refuses
cooperate in joint activities with other churches
(activities such as
evangelistic campaigns
joint worship services
mutual
recognition of ordination) (3
No personal fellowship
this involves the extremely strict avoidance of all personal
fellowship with members of another church; and prohibits any joint
prayer or Bible study; and sometimes even ordinary social contact,
with members of another church group. We will discuss the
possible reasons for these kinds of separation in the following
section.
history;
starting
Lay
Reau
Srpjntion
As we examine the motives people have had for church separation
throughout history; and as we compare those motives with the New
Testament requirements that we seek both the unity and the purity
of the visible church; we can find both right and wrong reasons for
separation Wrong reasons would include such things as persona
ambition and pride,
differences on minor doctrines Or practices
(doctrinal or behavioral patterns that would not affect any other
doctrine and that would not have
significant effect on the way one
lives the Christian life)
On the other hand_
there are some
reasons for separation that we
may considel
to be right (or possibly right, depending on the
specific circumstances). In most cases these reasons will flow from
the need to work for the purity of the church as well as its unity:
These reasons for separation can be considered in three categories:
doctrinal reasons;
reasons of conscience; (3) practical
considerations
In the following section,
have listed some
situations where
seems t0
that Christians would be required
leave
church: Then
have listed some other situations that seem
OMn
ess
clear; in which some Christians may think it wise to
leave
church; and others will think it unwise. In these less-clear
cases,
have generally not drawn any conclusions
but simply listed
the kinds of factors that Christians will want
consider:
Doctrinal Reasons_
need for separation may arise when the doctrinal
position of a church deviates from biblical standards in
serious way: This
deviation may be in official statements Or in actual belief and practice, insofar
as that can be determined_
But when does doctrinal
deviation become SO
serious thal
requires withdrawing from
church or
forming
separate
church? As
noted above; there are n0 commands
the New
Testament
separate from any tnue church;
as ic is still
pait of the body of Christ:
Paul $ response even
people in
churches (even in churches like the
one at Corinth, which tolerated serious doctrinal and moral error; and for
time tolerated some who rejected Paul $ apostolic authority) is not to tell
faithful Christians t0 separate from those churches
but t0 admonish the
churches
work for their repentance_
and pray for them. Of course there are
commands t0 discipline those who cause trouble within the church;
sometimes by
excluding them from church fellowship (1 Cor: 5:11-13; 2
Thess. 3.14-15_
Titus 3.10-11), but there are no instructions
leave the
church and cause division if this cannot be done immediately (see Rev: 2.14-
long
ering
16, 20-25; cf: Luke 9.50; 11.23).
Second John 10-11, which forbids the receiving of false teachers,
makes perhaps the strongest statement in the entire New Testament:
"Do not take him into your house or welcome him. Anyone who
welcomes him shares in his wicked work" (NIV) But it should be
noted that such
visitor is
teaching
serious heresy about the
person of Christ, one that prevents people from having saving faith.
(John is
talking about anyone who "does not abide in the doctrine
of Christ" and
does not have God" [v 9].) Moreover; this verse
refers t0 false teachers; not [0 all individuals who hold false beliefs_
because
of someone who comes t0 you and
does nOt
bring this doctrine
(v. 10; cf. v 7, "Many deceivers have gone Out
into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus
Christ in the flesh") John even uses the word antichrist for such
teachers. Finally, the greeting John has
mind refers either t0 an
officiab
church greeting Or one that would give an appearance of
endorsement of this doctrine, because the prohibition talks about
someone who
comes to YOu and does not bring this doctrine
10), which suggests that the person in view is
traveling teacher
who comes not t0 an individual
home but t0 address the church as
whole_
On the principle of separation
unbelievers or from
fundamental error that would involve the denial of the Christian
faith, Christians
seem t0 be required on doctrinal grounds t0
withdraw from
church and join 0r form
new
organization only
when the doctrinal
error is SO serious and s0 pervasive that the
parent church has become
false church, no longer part of the body
of Christ: This would be
church which is no longer
fellowship
of true believers
longer
true part of the body of Christ; r nO
longer
place where those who believe its teachings will find
salvation:
In the case of leaving
talse church, those who
separate will claim that in fact
have not left the true church; but
that
are the true church; and that the parent
organization has
left by means of its error: In fact; both Luther and Calvin eventually
that the Roman Catholic Church was not
true church:
However; even when withdrawal or separation is not absolutely
required, many Christians may find that it is wise Or expedient t0
withdraw before the church has become
false church; but when
speaks
from
would
they
they
said
serious doctrinal deviation occurs_
For instance
some would argue
that doctrinal deviation has become intolerable whenever heretical
views on major doctrines (such as the Trinity; the person of Christ,
the atonement; the resurrection, etc ) can be advocated by
church
leader without causing him to be subject t0 church discipline Or to
exclusion from the fellowship of the church: In other cases many
would say that separation should occur when the church as
body
publicly approves of some serious doctrinal or moral error (such as
endorsing
doctrinal
error in
church creed or statement of faith).
However; other Christians would not think separation t0 be wise
expedient in such cases, but would advocate praying and
for revival and reformation within the church, and giving clear
public statements of disagreement with any doctrinal error that has
been tolerated:
In such cases, those who decide to stay and those
who decide
must leave should both
recognize that God may
call different Christians t0 different roles and ministries
and
therefore to different decisions, and we would do well to give
considerable freedom t0 others t0 seek God $ wisdom in such
case
and to obey it as they best understand it for their own lives_
2. Matters of Conscience: In the area of conscience; if a Christian had no
freedom to preach or teach as his or her conscience _
informed by Scripture
would dictate, it might be thought that separation was necessary or at least
wise
But caution and great humility are
order here: individual judgment
may be distorted, especially if it is not informed by the consensus of faithful
believers throughout history; and by the counsel
of believers in the present:
Moreover; the command in 2 Corinthians 6:14 not to be yoked
together with unbelievers could also require
person t0 separate if
the parent church became s0 dominated by those who gave no
evidence of saving faith that such "yoking together" could not be
avoided_
In this passage the prohibition against being
yoked

Luke 9.50, but also

activities and the loss 0f freedom

the metaphor of being "yoked" together: Some people might also
find it necessary 0r at least wise t0 leave
church on the basis of
conscience if staying implied approval of some unbiblical doctrine
practice within the church; and thereby encouraged others to
follow that wrong doctrine 0r practice:
But others may think it right

case some would say that leaving

either the sinful act

But this does nOr seem [0 be

many Scripture passages could be cited
showing that disobedience

(see Acts 5.29; Dan. 3.18; 6.10) , and that one may disobey but

3. Practical Considerations _
Christians may decide t0 separate from
parent
church if, after prayerful consideration,
seems that staying in the parent
church will very likely result in more harm than good. This could be because
their work for the Lord would become frustrated and ineffectual due t0
opposition t0
from within the parent church, or because they would find
little or no fellowship with others
that church. Moreover; some may decide
that
staying in the church would harm the faith of other believers or would
hinder unbelievers from
to true faith because their continued
affiliation with the parent church would seem to imply approval of false
teachings within that church: Again, Christians might find themselves in
situations where they have prayed and worked for change for some time but
there seems
be no reasonable hope for change in the parent church, perhaps
because the present leadership group is resistant tO correction from Scripture;
is firmly entrenched, and
self-perpetuating
In all of these situations much
prayer and mature judgment will be required
because withdrawing from
church, especially by people who have been there
long time or have
established leadership functions in the church, is
serious action.
Are There Times When Cooperation and Personal Fellowship Are
Prohibited? Finally; when should Christians take stronger
steps than those
mentioned above and engage in the kind of separation that we earlier called
nO COO
peration
personal fellowship"? The biblical passages we have
looked at seen
require that Christians practice
no cooperation'
certain
activities with another group only when the other group is an
unbelieving one;
and then, it seems; only when the
unbelieving group shares control of the
activity (this is implied in the metaphor of being "yoked
together" in 2 Cor:
6.14). Of course
may be found wise 0r expedient On other grounds to

decide not t0 cooperate in
particular function
but non-cooperation would
not seem to be required except when the other group is an unbelieving one:
Certainly opposition to activities such as
evangelistic campaigns by other true
believers would be seen by the New Testament authors as divisiveness and
failure t0 demonstrate the unity of the body of Christ
The third and most extreme kind of separation, the avoidance of all
personal fellowship with members of another entire church group
never commanded in the New Testament_ Such an extreme
measure of
no fellowship'
is only implied in serious cases of
church discipline of individuals_
not in cases of differences with
entire churches_

The Power of the Church
What kind of authority does the church have? How should church
discipline function?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
When we look at the powerful governments of the
and at
other business and educational organizations that have great
influence
and then consider our local churches_
01 even 0ur
denominational headquarters, the church may seem t0 US to be
weak and ineffective. Moreover; when we recognize the rapid
growth of evil that is seen daily in our society; we may wonder if
the church has power t0 make any changes at all.
On the other hand_
in some countries the officially recognized
church has great influence on the conduct of national affairs_
This
was
certainly true of the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in
former times in some southern European and Latin American
countries (and is still true today to some extent). It was true of the
Church of England in previous centuries, and of John Calvin $
church in Geneva, Switzerland, while he was alive_
and of the
church founded by the pilgrims in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in
1620.
Situations like these where the church appears to have great
influence cause uS tO ask whether Scripture places any limitations
on the church $ power:
We may define the power of the church as follows: The power of
the church is its God-given authority t0 carry on spiritual warfare,
proclaim the gospel, and exercise church discipline:
Although these three areas overlap and could be treated in any
order; since the category of
spiritual warfare
is the broader
category it will be treated
This perspective on the church s
power also reminds us that the power of the church, unlike the
worldly influence exercised by human armies and governments,
world
fitst
directly affects the spiritual realm:
SpitituilWinin
Paul reminds the Corinthians_
"For though we live in the
are not canying on
worldly war; for the weapons of our warfare
are nor
worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds
Cor: 10.3-4). These weapons, used against demonic forces that
hinder the spread of the gospel and the progress of the church,
include such things as prayer; worship; the authority tO rebuke
demonic forces; the words of Scripture, faith, and righteous conduct
on the
of the members of the church: (Paul gives further details
about our spiritual
conflict and the armor we wear for it in Eph:
6.10-18.)
When
consider this spiritual power in
broad sense
it certainly
includes the power of the gospel
break through sin and hardened
opposition and awaken faith in the hearts of unbelievers (see Rom:
10:17; James 1.18;
Peter 1.23). But this power also includes
spiritual
power that will render demonic opposition t0 the gospel
ineffective_
We see examples of this in Acts 13.8-11=
where Paul
pronounced judgment on Elymas the magician, who was opposing
the preaching of the gospel, and in Acts 16.16-18, where Paul
rebuked an evil spirit in the
soothsaying girl who was annoying
Paul while he proclaimed the gospel.
Such spiritual
puxer (C
defeat evil opposition was seen frequently in the early church; such
as in the
freeing of Peter from prison (Acts 12.1-17), and perhaps
also in the subsequent
judgment on King Herod Agrippa
(Acts
12.20-24).
Yet Paul realizes that he can use this spiritual power not only
against those outside the church who oppose the gospel, but also
those within the church who are active opponents of his
apostolic ministry: He says about some arrogant troublemakers in
the church;
will come t0 You soon, if the Lord wills, and
will
find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power: For
the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power" (1 Cor:
4.19-20). Such power
not
be trifled with; for it was the same
power of the Holy Spirit that had brought death t0 Ananias and
Sapphira (Acts 5.1-11) and blindness
Elymas (Acts 13.8-11).
Paul did not wish tO use this power in
judgmental capacity; but he
was prepared t0 do s0 if necessary: Later he wrote again t0 the
world
patt
against _
Corinthians that his actions when present would be as powerful as
his letters when absent (2 Cor: 10.8-11), and he wared those who
opposed his authority and had sinned publicly and not repented, "If
come
will not spare them
since you desire proof that
Christ is speaking in me_
For we are weak in him;, but in
dealing
with yOu we shall live with him by the power of God" (2 Cor: 13.2-
4) . He then adds
final reminder of his reluctance [0 use this
authority; telling them that he is
before he comes
in order
that when
come
may not have t0 be severe in my use of the
authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for
down" (2 Cor: 13.10).
Now we may question whether the church today has the same
degree of spiritual power that the apostles Peter or Paul did.
Certainly there is
distinction between the apostles and the other
early Christians even in the book ot Acts (note that immediately
after the death of Ananias and Sapphira
many signs and wonders
were done "by the hands of the apostles_
but
None of the rest
dared join them, but the people held them in high honor;
Acts
5.12-13). Moreover; Paul did not instruct any leaders of the church
Corinth; or even
Timothy or Titus,
exercise that spiritual
power at Corinth against his opponents
He spoke about the power
which the Lord "has given me
(2 Cor: 13.10) , not about the power
which the Lord had given to the church or to Christians generally
On the other hand_
Paul did direct the Corinthian church t0 exercise
church discipline in
case of incest in the church at Corinth; and
do it
'when you are assembled, and my spirit is present, with the
power of our Lord Jesus
(1 Cor: 5.4). Moreover; the descriptions
of spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6.10-18 and
Corinthians 10.3-4
seem
applicable to Christians generally; and few today would deny
that the church has authority to pray against and
speak with
authority against demonic opposition to the work of the gospel.
there would seem to be at least some
significant
of spiritual
power
evil opposition that God is willing to grant to the
church in every age
(including the present one): Perhaps it is
impossible to define more specifically the degree of spiritual
puxer
God will grant to the church in times of conflict against evil, but we
do not need t0 know the details in advance: our
is simply to
be faithful to Scripture in praying and in
exercising church
discipline, and then to leave the rest in God'
hands, knowing that
he will grant sufficient power to accomplish his purposes through

Kucuomn
The phrase "the
of the kingdom'
occurs only once in the
Bible, in Matthew 16.19, where Jesus
speaking to Peter:
will
give you the
of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever You
shall bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven and whatever
you shall
oose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven
(NASB)
What is the meaning of these
keys of the kingdom of heaven
Elsewhere in the New Testament
key always implies authority to
open
door and give entrance to
place or realm: Jesus says_
tO you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of
knowledge=
did not enter yourselves_
and yOu hindered those
who were entering
(Luke 11:52). Moreover; Jesus says in
Revelation 1.18,
have the
of Death and Hades_
implying
that he has the authority tO grant entrance and exit from those
realms (Cf: also Rev 3.7; 9.1; 20:1; also the messianic prediction
in Isa_
22.22.)
The "keys of the kingdom of heaven'
therefore represent at least
the authority t0 preach the gospel of Christ (cf. Matt: 16.16) and
thus
open the door of the kingdom of heaven and allow people to
enter:
Peter first used this authority by preaching the gospel at Pentecost
(Acts 2.14-42).
But the other apostles also were given this
authority in
primary sense (they wrote the gospel in permanent
form in the New Testament).
And all believers have this "key" in
secondary sense, for
can all share the gospel with others_

But is there any other authority; in addition t0 this, that Jesus

There
are IwO factors suggesting that the authority of the keys here also
includes the authority to exercise discipline within the church:
The plural "keys" suggests authority over more than one door:
Thus, more than simply entrance into the kingdom is implied; some
authority within the kingdom is also suggested. (2) Jesus completes
the promise about the keys with

also refer t0 church discipline in
Matthew 16, where Jesus' words are very similar:

after
promising to build his church (v 18), Jesus

Therefore it seems that
"the keys of the kingdom of heaven" which Jesus promised t0 Peter
in Matthew 16.19 included both
ability to admit people t0 the
kingdom through preaching the gospel, and
authority t0 exercise
church discipline for those who do enter:
In Matthew 16.16-19, Jesus does not indicate whether the authority
of the keys will later be given to others besides Peter But certainly
the authority t0
the gospel is given tO others at
later time,
and in Matthew 18.18 Jesus does state explicitly that the authority

whenever it meets and corporately carries out such discipline

but the phrase is
broader than that, and includes specific actions that are subject tO
discipline as well:
Yet the authority of the
with respect to church discipline is not
completely unlimited. It will only be effective against true sin (cf.
Matt: 18.15) , sin as defined by God's Word: The church does not
have authority On its OWwn to legislate what is morally right and
wrong in an absolute sense
for the authority to define right and
wrong belongs
God alone (see Rom: 1.32; 2.16; 3.4-8; 9.20; Ps_
119.89, 142, 160; Matt: 5.18). The church can only declare and
teach what God has already commanded in his Word_
Nor can the
authority of the keys involve authority to forgive sins in any
absolute sense, because in Scripture
is clear that that can only be
done by God himself (Isa. 43.25; 55.7; Mark 2.7, 10; Ps. 103.3;
John 1.9).
Therefore the authority t0 carry out discipline in the
church is an
authority that must be carried out in accordance with
the standards of Scripture_
Is it possible t0 be any more specific about the kind of spiritual
authority that is involved in this use of the keys of the kingdom of
heaven? Both Matthew 16.19 and 18.18 use an unusual Greek
verbal construction (a periphrastic future perfect). It is best
translated by the NASB; "Whatever YOu shall bind on earth shall
have been bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth
shall have been loosed in heaven:

is not as if the church must wait for God to endorse its

direction of the church's disciplinary action.

The previous sections have discussed spiritual power
and spiritual
warfare to be exercised by the church: But should the church ever
use physical force (weapons and armies_
for example) to carry out
its mission? The phrase commonly used t0 refer t0 the idea of
physical, worldly warfare is "to take up the sword
There are several
indications in Scripture that the church must
never take up the sword
cany out its purposes in the new
covenant age. This was
dreadful mistake made in the Crusades_
when church-sponsored armies marched across Europe and Asia to
attempt t0 reclaim the land of Israel. In these cases the church was
trying t0 use physical force

territories
But Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it
were

the power of the keys

"The weapons of our
warfare are not worldly" (2 Cor: 10.4)-
Certainly God does give to civil government the right to bear the

that is_
force tO punish evil in the world (Rom: 13.1-
7). But there
no indication that the power of government is t0 be
used to enforce adherence to Christianity upon any people
Moreover; there are several indications that Jesus refused t0 use the
power of physical force t0 compel people to accept the gospel. For
example,
when

and John asked, "Lord_
do you want us to bid fire come down from

prerogative of the church to use physical

Jesus clearly made

the government and the authority that God exercises in Our personal
him when he said, "Render therefore t0 Caesar the
things that are Caesar
and to God the things that are God s"
(Malt: 22.21).
And though Jesus recognized the authority of civil
government; he refused tO USUIp that authority himself,

A further reason why the government should not use force t0
require allegiance t0 Christianity is that in the new covenant;
membership in the church and allegiance to Christ must be
voluntary:

fact, faith in Christ; t0 be truly held and practiced, cannot be

From this it also follows that the civil government should not

These limitations on the activities of the church and the state are

The Purpose of Church Discipline.
Restoration and Reconciliation of the Believer Who Is Going Astray:
Sin hinders fellowship among believers and with God. In order for
reconciliation t0 OCCuI; the sin must be dealt with:
Therefore, the primary
purpose of church discipline
pursue the twofold
of restoration (of
the offender t0 right behavior) and reconciliation (between believers; and with
God):
Just as wise parents discipline their children (Prov 13.24: "He who
loves [his son] is diligent to discipline him"
and just as God our Father
disciplines those whom he loves (Heb: 12.6; Rev 3.19) , s0 the church in its
discipline
in love t0
back
brother or sister who has gone
astray,
reestablishing
that person in right fellowship and rescuing him or her
from destructive patterns of life_
In Matthew 18.15, the hope is that discipline
will stop at the first
when someone goes alone-
"If he listens
YO, you
have
your brother:
The phrase
you have
your brother"
implies that those carrying out discipline should keep the
of personal
reconciliation among Christians always in mind. Paul reminds uS that we are
restore
the sinning brother Or sister "in
spirit of gentleness
(Gal: 6.1),
and James encourages uS to
back
sinner from the error of his way"
(James 5.20)_
if church members were actively involved in giving private
words of
admonition and in praying for one another when
the
clear evidence of sinful conduct is seen, very little formal
church discipline would have to be carried out, because the process
would begin and end with
conversation between two people that
never becomes known t0 anyone else.
Even when the final step of
excommunication
(that is, putting
someone out of the fellowship or
communion" of the church) is
taken_
is still
the hope that repentance will result Paul
delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander t0 Satan "that they may learn
not to blaspheme
(1 Tim. 1.20), and the man living in incest at
Corinth was to be delivered to Satan "that his spirit may be saved in
the day of the Lord Jesus'
Cor: 5.5).

of those who have been hurt; which
often lie near the surface, will much more easily be avoided:
To Keep the Sin
Spreading to Others: Although the primary
of church discipline is restoration and reconciliation for the erring believer; in
this present age reconciliation and restoration will not always come about
But whether restoration comes about Or' nOt, the church is told t0 carry out
discipline because tWo other purposes are served as well
One other purpose is that the sin will be

others. The author of Hebrews tells Christians t0 see t0 it that
root of bitterness' spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many
become defiled" (Heb
12.15). This means that if conflict between
persons is nOt resolved quickly; the effects may spread t0 many
others
something that sadly seems to be true in many cases of
church division_
Paul also says
"Alittle leaven leavens the whole
lump,
and tells the Corinthians to put out of the church
man
living in incest (1 Cor: 5.2,6-7) , lest his sin affect the whole
church: If that man were not disciplined_
the effects of the sin
would spread t0 many Others who were aware of it and saw that the
church paid little attention to it: This would cause many t0 think
that perhaps that sin was not as bad as they had thought; and others
might be tempted to commit similar Or related kinds of sin.
Moreover;
discipline
One

will be much more difficult for the church to cany out
discipline if
similar kind of sin is committed by someone else in
the fucure_
Paul also told Timothy that elders who persist in sin are to be
rebuked in the presence of all,
So [hat [he rest may Stand
fear
Tim. 5.20)
that is_
so that many others would realize that the
sin will not be tolerated but will receive discipline both from the
church and from God himself: In fact, Paul rebuked Peter publicly;
in order that others would not follow Peter's bad example of
separating himself and
only with Jewish believers (Gal:
2.11).
To Protect the Purity of the Church and the Honor of Christ: A third
purpose of church discipline is that the purity of the church is to be protected,
that Christ -

dishonor t0 Christ. It is similar
the situation of Jews who disobeyed God s law and led unbelievers to scoff
and blaspheme God $ name (Rom. 2.24: "The name of God is blasphemed
among the Gentiles because of you")
This is why Paul is shocked that the Corinthians have not
disciplined the man who continued in willful sin that was publicly
known in the church (1 Cor: 5.1-2: "And YOu are
arrogant! Ought
You not rather t0 moum?" _
He is also greatly distressed to know
that "brother goes to law against brother; and that before
unbelievers'
Cor: 6.6)
Rather than allowing such moral
blemishes on the character of the church; Peter encourages
believers to "be zealous to be found by [Christ] without spot or
blemish, and at peace
(2 Peter 3.14). And our Lord Jesus wants t0
present t0 himself
church
without spot or wrinkle
and
without blemish" (Eph: 5.27), for he is the head of the church, and
its character reflects on his reputation.
Even angels and demons
look at the church and behold the wisdom of God expressed in it
(Eph: 3.10); therefore (Eph: 4.1) Paul encourages Christians to be
eager t0 maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
(Eph. 4.3)
This is
very serious matter: Since the Lord Jesus is jealous for his
own honor; if the church does nOt exercise proper discipline, he
himself, as he did at Corinth; where the Lord's discipline
resulted in sickness and death (1 Cor: 11.27-34), and as he warned
he would do both at Pergamum (Rev 2.14-15) and at Thyatira
(Rev 2.20). In these last two cases the Lord was displeased with the
whole church for tolerating outward disobedience and not
exercising discipline:
"But
have this against You, that you tolerate
the woman Jezebel, who calls herself
prophetess and is
teaching
and beguiling my servants

(Rev: 2.20; cf: vv: 14-16).
2. For What Sins Should Church Discipline Be Exercised? On the one
hand, Jesus

in Matthew 18.15-20 tells us thar if

then the matter must be brought to the church:

Gentile and
(ax
collector: (Matt: 18.15-17)
In this case the matter
has progressed from
private and informal situation t0
public and much more formal
process of discipline by the whole church
On the other hand_
there does not seem t0 be any explicit limitation
specified for the kinds of sin that should be subject to church
discipline_
The examples of sins subject tO church discipline in the
New Testament are extremely diverse: divisiveness (Rom: 16.17;
Titus 3.10) , incest (1 Cor: 5.1), laziness and
t0 work (2
Thess. 3.6-10) , disobeying what Paul writes (2 Thess. 3.14-15),
blasphemy
Tim. 1:20), and teaching heretical doctrine
John
10-11).
Nonetheless,
definite principle appears t0 be at work: all sins that
were explicitly disciplined in the New Testament were publicly
known 0r outwardly evident sins;
and many of them had
continued over
period of time: The fact that the sins were publicly
known meant that reproach was being brought on the church
Christ
was
dishonored_
and there was
real possibility that others
would be encouraged to follow the wrongful patterns of life that

being publicly tolerated
There is always the need
however; for mature judgment in the
exercise of church discipline_
because there is lack of complete
sanctification in all our lives
Furthermore
when we realize that

should also remember that where there are issues of conduct on
which Christians legitimately disagree,
Paul encourages

degree of tolerance (Rom: 14.1-23).
3. How Should Church Discipline Be Carried Out?
Knowledge of the Sin Should Be Kept to the Smallest Group Possible:
This seems
be the purpose in Matthew 18:15-17 behind the gradual

better; because repentance is easier; fewer people are led astray; and less harm
is done t0 the
reputation of the person, the reputation of the church; and the
reputation of Christ:
b. Disciplinary Measures Should Increase in Strength Until There Is a
Solution: Once again in Matthew 18 Jesus teaches Us that we cannot stop
simply with
private conversation if that has not brought satisfactory results_
He requires that the wronged person first go alone
and then take one 0r' [WO
others (Matt: 18.15-16). Moreover; if a Christian thinks that he Or she has
wronged
suleOME
else (0r even if that other person thinks that he or she has
been wronged), Jesus requires that the person who has done the wrong (Or is
thought
have done the wrong) go tO the person who considers himself the
victim of
wrongdoing (Matt: 5.23). This means that whether we have been
wronged or others think they have been wronged, it is always our
responsibility to take the initiative and go [O the other person. Jesus does not
allow us tO wait for the other person to come
After
private meeting and
small group meeting
Jesus does not
specify that the elders or officers of the church are next to be
consulted as
group
but certainly this intermediate step seems to
be appropriate, because Jesus may simply be summarizing the
process without necessarily mentioning every possible step in iL In
there are several examples of small group admonition in the
New Testament which are carried out by elders Or other church
officers (see
Thess. 5.12;
Tim. 4.2; Titus 1.13; 2.15; 3.10;
James 5.19-20). Moreover; the principle of keeping the knowledge
of sin t0 the smallest group possible would certainly encourage this
intermediate step as well:
Finally; if the situation cannot be resolved Jesus says to "tell it t0
the church'
(Matt: 18.17). In this case the church would be
assembled to hear the facts of the case and t0 come t0
decision:
Since Jesus allows for the possibility that the person
listen even t0 the church" (v 17), the church may have t0 meet once
decide what to say t0 the offender; and then meet
exclude that person from the fellowship of the church:
When Jesus gives these directions about church discipline_
reminds the church that his Own presence and his own power are
fact,
Freluses
again
behind the decisions made by the church:
Again

EwO of you agree on earth about
anything they ask, it will be done
for them by my Father in heaven. For where IwO Or three are
in my name

(Matt.
18.19-20). Jesus promises to be present in church gatherings
generally; but specifically here with respect to the church being
for discipline of an
offending member: And Paul similarly
tells the Corinthians to discipline the erring member when they are
assembled
with the power of our Lord Jesus
(1 Cor: 5.4). This is
not an activity t0 be taken lightly, but is carried out in the presence
of the Lord, the spiritual component of
actually being carried out
by the Lord himself:
If this ever must be done; the whole church will then know that the
erring person is no longer considered
member of the church; and
that person would not be allowed
take Communion, since
partaking
the Lord's Supper is
sign of partaking in the unity of
the church (1 Cor: 10.17: "Because there is one bread_
we who are

There are other passages in the New Testament that speak of
avoiding fellowship with the excommunicated person.
Paul tells the

Moreover; he says_
"If any one refuses t0

letter; note that man, and have nothing to do with him, that he may
be ashamed_
Do not look on him as an enemy; but warn him as
brother "
Thess. 3.14-15). Second John 10-IL also prohibits
greeting or welcoming into the house anyone who is promoting
false teaching_
These instructions are apparently given
prevent
the church from giving
others the impression that it approves of
the disobedience of the erring person:
Discipline of Church Leaders: In one passage Paul gives special
directives
concerning the discipline of church elders:
Never admit any

these rules without favor;
nothing from partiality. (1 Tim:
5.19-21)
Paul here gives
special caution t0 protect elders from individual attacks:
action
regarding wrongdoing in this case should require the evidence of two
three witnesses_
Those who persist in
to be rebuked "in the
presence of all:
This is because the bad example of wrongful conduct by
elders will very likely have
widespread negative effect On others who see
their lives_
Then Paul reminds Timothy
nothing from partiality" in this
situation;
very helpful warning; since Timothy was probably
close friend
to many of the elders in the church at Ephesus:
Paul $ command t0 rebuke
sinning elder publicly means that some
statement of the nature of the offense must be made [0 the church
("rebuke them in the presence of all;
20).
On the other hand,
every detail of the sin has t0 be disclosed tO the church_
helpful guideline is that the church should be told enough that (L)
will understand how serious the offense was
will be
able to understand and support the discipline process
and (3) they
will not subsequently feel the sin was minimized 0r covered up if
more details somehow leak out later:
Such
public disclosure of the sin of
leader will signal t0 the
congregation that the leaders of the church will not hide such
matters from them in the future.
This will increase the confidence
of the church in the integrity of the leadership board_
also
allow the sinning leader to begin the gradual process of rebuilding
relationships and trust with the
congregation
because he will not
have to deal with people who have
hundred different speculations
about what his sin was, but with people who know the
specific sin,
and can see the
genuine repentance and change regarding that area
of sin in his life:
What about the serious sins of people who are not church leaders?
Scripture gives no command to disclose publicly the sins of people
who are
ordinary members but not
recognized leaders in the church:
Leaders _

Other Aspects of Church Discipline: Once discipline has occurred,
soon as there is repentance at any stage of the process, the Christians who
have known about the discipline should welcome the repentant person back
quickly into the fellowship
the church_
Paul says,
You should rather

Finally; we should notice that immediately following the passage on

need for personal forgiveness of those who sin against US (Matt:

Church Government
How should
church be governed? How should church officers be
chosen? Should women serve aS pastors of churches?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Churches today have many different forms of government The
Roman Catholic Church has
worldwide government under the
authority of the
Episcopalian churches have bishops with
regional authority; and archbishops over them. Presbyterian
churches
regiona
authority t0 presbyteries and national
authority t0
general assemblies. On the other hand, Baptist churches
and many other independent churches have no formal governing
authority beyond the local congregation, and affiliation with
denominations is 0n
voluntaly basis_
Within local churches; Baptists often have
single pastor with
board of deacons; but some have
board of elders as well
Presbyterians have
board of elders and Episcopalians have
vestry. Other churches simply have
church board.
there
New Testament pattern for church government? Is any
one form of church government to be preferred over another? These
are the questions addressed in this chapter:
However; at the outset
must be said that the form of church
government iS nOr
major doctrine like the Trinity, the deity of
Christ; substitutionary atonement; O the authority of Scripture
Although
believe_
atter
examining the New Testament evidence
that one particular form of church government is preferable to the
others_
nevertheless
each form has some weaknesses as well as
strengths
And church history attests that several different forms of
government have worked fairly well for severa)
centuries
Moreover; while some aspects of church government seem to be
reasonably clear from the New Testament; other matters (such as
Pope.
grant
the way in which church officers should be chosen) are less clear;
mainly because the New Testament evidence on them
not
extensive, and thus our inferences from this evidence are less
certain. It seems t0 me_
then, that there ought to be room for
evangelical Christians t0 differ amicably over this question; in the
hope that further understanding may be gained. And
also seems
that individual Christians
-While
may have
preference for
one system or another; and while
may wish at appropriate
times t0 argue forcefully for one system over another
-should
nevertheless be willing to live and minister within any of several
different Protestant systems of church government in which they
may find themselves from time t0 time_
But
do nOr mean t0 say that this is an entirely unimportant matter:
In this area as well as Others,
church may be more or less pure. If
there are clear New Testament patterns regarding some aspects of
church government; then there will be negative consequences in OUr
churches if we disregard them, even
we cannot foresee all of
those consequences at the present time.
Therefore Christians are
certainly free t0 speak and write on this subject in order t0 work for
increased purity in the church:
In this chapter we shall first suivey the New Testament data
concerning church officers, especially apostle, elder; and deacon.
Then we shall ask how church officers should be chosen: After that
shall look at tWo controversial questions: Which form of church
government
any-
-is closest tO the New
Testament pattern?
And, may women serve as officers in the church?
Church Officer:
For purposes of this chapter; we will use the
following definition:_
church officer
someone who has been
publicly recognized as
having tne rignt and responsibility tO perform certain functions for
the benefit of the whole church:
According
this definition, elders and deacons would be
considered officers in
church, as would the pastor (if that is _
distinct office).
The church treasurer and church moderator would
also be officers (these titles may vary from church t0 church) All of
these people have had public recognition, usually at
service in
which they are "installed" 01
ordained" in an office.
need
public recognition in order t0 fulfill their responsibilities: for
they

facl,
they
example, it would not be appropriate for people to wonder from
week tO week who was tO receive the
offering and deposit it in the
bank; or for various people t0 argue that they had been gifted
take that responsibility in any particular week! The orderly
functioning of the church requires that one person be recognized as
having that responsibility Similarly; the pastor who is responsible
do Bible
each Sunday morning must be
recognized as
having the right and responsibility t0 do that (at least; in most forms
of church government) . If this were not the case, then many people
might prepare sermons and all claim the right t0 preach, O1 on some
Sundays no one might prepare. Similarly; in order for people t0
follow the elders of the church and look to them for
guidance;
must know who the elders are
By contrast many other people exercise gifts in the church; but we
do not say they have an "office'
becaus
do not need formal
public recognition for their
function. Those who have
gift
of "helps'
(see
Cor: 12.28), 0r who have
gift of especially
strong faith, or
gift of "distinguishing between spirits" (1 Cor:
12.10), or"
gift of exhorting Or contributing (Rom. 12.8) do not
need public recognition in order t0 function effectively in the
church:
In the material that follows_
we shall see that the New Testament
discusses one church office which was limited t0 the time when the
early church was founded (the office of apostle), and two other
church offices which continue throughout the church age (the
offices of elder and deacon):
Apostle
Earlier in this book we saw that the New Testament apostles had
unique kind of authority in the early church: authority to speak and write
words which were
words of God" in an absolute sense. To disbelieve
disobey them was t0 disbelieve 0r disobey God
The apostles, therefore; had
the authority t0 write words which became words of Scripture_
This fact
itself should suggest tO 4s that there was something unique about the office of
apostle_
and that we would not expect it t0 continue today; for no one today
can add words to the Bible and have them be counted as God'$ very words 0r
as part of Scripture.
In addition, the
Testament information on the
qualifications of
apostle and the identity of the apostles also leads uS t0 conclude
teaching
they
they
gifts ,
New
that the office was unique and limited to the first century; and that
are t0 expect no more apostles today:
We shall see this as We
ask the
following questions: What were the requirements for
apostle? Who were the apostles? How many apostles were there?
And are there apostles today?
At the outset ir must be made clear thar the answers [0 these
questions depend on what one means by the word apostle. Today
some people use the word apostle in a
broad sense
tO refer t0
an effective church planter; or to
significant missionary pioneer
("William Carey was an
apostle to India
for example): If we use
the word apostle in this broad sense, everyone would agree that
there are still apostles today-
for there are certainly effective
missionaries and church planters today:
The New Testament itself has three verses in which the word
apostle (Gk. apostolos) is used in
broad sense
not [0 refer
any
specific church office, but simply t0 mean
messenger:
Philippians 2.25, Paul calls Epaphroditus
YOuI messenger
(apostolos) and minister t0 my need" ; in 2 Corinthians 8.23, Paul
refers
those who accompanied the offering that he was
Jerusalem as
messengers [apostoloi] of the churches
and in John
13.16, Jesus says; "Nor is he who is sent [apostolos]greater than he
who sent him:
But there is another sense for the word apostle. Much more
frequently in the New Testament the word refers to
special office,
apostle of Jesus Christ
In this narrow sense of the term; there
are nO more
apostles today; and we are t0 expect no more_
This is
because of what the New Testament says about the qualifications
for being an apostle and about who the apostles were
Qualifications of an Apostle: The two qualifications for
apostle
Were
(1) having seen Jesus after his resurrection with one
own eyes (thus
being an
eyewitness 0f the resurrection'
and (2) having been specifically
commissioned by Christ as his apostle_
The fact that an apostle had to have seen the risen Lord with his
own eyes is indicated by Acts 1.22, where Peter said that person to
replace Judas "must become with us
witness t0 his resurrection:
Moreover; it was "t0 the apostles whom he had chosen'
that "he
presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing
being
very
taking
being
them during
days'
(Acts 1.2-3; cf: 4.33).
Paul makes much of the fact that he did meer this qualification even
though it was in an unusual way (Christ appeared t0 him in
vision
on the road [0
Damascus and appointed him as an apostle: Acts
9.5-6; 26.15-18). When he is defending his apostleship he says_
Am
not an apostle? Have
not seen Jesus our Lord?" (1 Cor:
9.1).
And when recounting the people to whom Christ appeared
after his resurrection;
Paul says, "Then he appeared t0 James, then
to all the apostles_
Last of all, as t0 one untimely born, he appeared
also [0 me.
For
am the least of the apostles_
unfic to be called an
apostle" (1 Cor: 15.7-9).
These verses combine t0 indicate that unless someone had seen
Jesus after the resurrection with his own eyes_
he could nor be an
apostle.
The second qualification, specific appointment by Christ as an
apostle; is also evident from several verses. FirSt; though the term
apostle is not common in the gospels_
the twelve disciples are
called
apostles'
specifically in
context where Jesus is
commissioning them;
sending them out" t0 preach in his name:
And he called to him his welve disciples and gave them authority
over unclean spirits
cast them out, and t0 heab
every disease and
every infirmity The names of the twelve apostles are these
These
[welve Jesus sent OUL;
charging them,
preach as YOu g0, saying;
'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
(Matt_ 10:1-7)
Similarly, Jesus commissions his apostles in a special sense to be
his "witnesses
t0 the end of the earth" (Acts 1.8). And in
choosing another apostle t0 replace Judas, the eleven apostles did
not take the responsibility on themselves, but prayed and asked the
ascended Christ t0 make the appointment:
"Lord, who knows the hearts of all men, show which one of these IwO
you have chosen t0 take the place in this ministry and apostleship
from which Judas turned aside.
And
cast lors for them, and
the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles
(Acts 1.24-26)
Paul himself insists that Christ personally appointed him as an
apostle. He tells how, on the Damascus Road, Jesus told him that he
forty
they
Was
appointing him as an apostle t0 the Gentiles:
have appeared
you for this purpose, to appoint YOu t0 serve and to bear witness
delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles
whom
send
(Acts 26.16-17). He later affirms that he was
specifically appointed by Christ as an apostle (see Rom
1:1; Gal:
1:1;
Tim. 1.12; 2.7; 2 Tim
:H1) .
Who Were Apostles? The initial group of apostles numbered twelve
the
eleven original disciples who remained after Judas died, plus Matthias_
who
replaced Judas:
And
cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and
he was enrolled with the eleven apostles
(Acts 1.26). So important was this
original group of twelve apostles, the "charter members" of the office of
apostle_
that we read that their names are inscribed on the foundations of the
heavenly city; the New Jerusalem: "And the wall of the city had twelve
foundations,
and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb
(Rev: 21.14).
We might at first think that such
group could never be expanded,
that no one could be added to it: But then Paul clearly claims that
also, is an apostle:
And Acts 14.14 calls both Barnabas and Paul
apostles:
when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it
with Paul and Barnabas there are fourteen "apostles of Jesus
Christ
Then James the brother of Jesus (who was not one of the twelve
original disciples_
seems t0 be called an apostle in Galatians 1.19:
Paul tells how; when he went t0 Jerusalem;
saw none of the other
apostles except James the Lord's brother:
Then in Galatians 2.9
James is classified with Peter and John as "pillars" of the Jerusalem
church
And in Acts 15.13-21, James, along with Peter; exercises
significant leadership function in the Jerusalem Council,
function
which would be appropriate to the office of apostle: Furthermore;
when Paul is listing the resurrection appearances of Jesus he once
readily classifies James with the apostles:
Then he appeared to James, then t0 all the apostles. Last of all, as t0
one untimely born; he appeared also to me.
For

decide the issue:
Romans 16.7 says,; "Greet Andronicus and Junias; my kinsmen and
my fellow prisoners; they are men of note among the apostles, and
were in Christ before me_
Because there are several
translation problems in the verse, no clear conclusions can be
reached: "Men of note'
may be also translated "men noted by"
(the
apostles). "Junias'

Silas (Silvanus) and

impossible that he would have been in Jerusalem before Pentecost
and would there have seen the risen Lord and come t0 believe in
him, and then suddenly have been appointed as an apostle_
addition, Paul $ pattern of address in his letters always jealously

In order to qualify as an apostle, someone (1) had to have seen

there are no

In place of

have
instead the writings of the apostles in the books of the New

years of the church:
Though some may use the word apostle in English today

Plural Elders: The Pattern in All New Testament Churches: The next
church office t0 be considered is thar of
elder:
Although some have argued
that different forms of church government are evident in the New
Testament;
suivey of the relevant texts shows the opposite to be true: there
is quite
consistent pattem of plural elders as the main
governing group in
Testament churches. For instance; in Acts 14.23 we read,
And when
had appointed elders

church shortly after the church began_
We know that Paul also established
elders in the church at Ephesus
tOr we read;
From Miletus he sent
Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church" (Acts 20.17). Moreover;
Paul'$ apostolic assistants apparently were instructed to carry out
similar
process, for Paul wrote t0 Titus; "This is why
left you in Crete_
that you
might amend what was defective, and appoint elders in every town as
directed you" (Titus 1.5). Shortly after
church has been established, once
again we see elders
established in office, in
every town" in which there
was

And Paul reminded Timothy of the time
when the elders laid

(1 Tim. 414)
James writes, "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of
the church; and let them pray over him; anointing him with oil in
the name of the Lord" (James 5.14). This is
significant statement
because the epistle of James is
general letter written
many
churches, all the believers scattered abroad, whom James
characterizes as "the twelve tribes in the Dispersion'
(James 1:1). It
indicates that James expected that there would be elders in every

similar conclusion can be drawn from
Peter: Peter writes_

Two significant conclusions may be drawn from this survey of the
New Testament evidence: First, no passage suggests that any
church, no matter how small, had only one elder: The consistent
New Testament pattern is
plurality of elders "in every church"
(Acts 14.23) and "in every town" (Titus 1.5).
Second, we do not

church, but
unified and consistent pattern in which every church

13.17;
Peter 5.2-3).
Other Names for Elders: Pastors_
Overseers, Bishops: Elders are also
called
pastors
or "bishops'
overseers'
in the New Testament. The least
commonly used word (at least in the noun form) is pastor (Gk: poimen). It
may be
surprising tO US t0 find that this word
which has become So common
in English, only occurs once in the New Testament when speaking about a
church officer: In Ephesians 411, Paul writes,
And his gifts were that some
should be apostles, some prophets
some
evangelists, some pastors and
[eachers.
The verse is probably better translated
'pastor-teachers'
(one
group) rather than
pastors and teachers'
(suggesting two groups) because of
the Greek construction (though not every New Testament scholar agrees with
that translation):
The connection with
suggests that these pastors
were some
perhaps all) of the elders who carried on the work of teaching-
for one qualification for an elder
that he be
able
teach"
Tim: 3.2).
Although the noun pastor (poimen) is not used of church officers
elsewhere in the New Testament;
the related verb which means
"t0 act as
shepherd" or "to act as
pastor" (Gk: poimaino) is
applied
elders
Paul'$ address
the Ephesian elders_
He tells
them "to shepherd the church of God" (Acts 20.28_
literally
translating the verb poimaino), and in the same sentence he referred
to God $ people as "all the flock;
another related noun (Gk
poimnion) which means
flock of sheep_
So Paul directly charges
these Ephesian
Iders to act as shepherds or
pastors_
The same
verb is used in
Peter 5.2 where Peter tells the elders
shepherd (poimaino) the flock of God that is your charge'
(author'
translation)
Then [Wo verses later Jesus is called the chief
pastor or "chief shepherd" (Gk archipoimen,
Peter 5.4) , implying
quite clearly that Peter also viewed the elders as shepherds or
pastors
in the church: Therefore, although the noun pastor is only
used once t0 refer [0 elders_
the related verb is used twice in
teaching
using
passages that explicitly identify the task of shepherding with the
office of elder:
Another term used for elders in the New Testament is
Greek word
episkopos,;
which is variously translated as
overseer" 0r
"bishop;
depending on the individua
passage and the English translation
But this word also seems quite clearly to be another term for elders
New Testament usage.
For example, when Paul has called t0 him
the elders of the church at Ephesus (Acts 20:17), he says t0 them;
"Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock; in which the Holy
Spirit has made YOu overseers (Gk episkopos)" (Acts 20.28).
Paul
quite readily refers
these Ephesian elders as
overseers'
(or
"bishops'
Timothy 31-2, Paul writes
"If any one aspires t0 the office of
bishop, he desires
noble task Now
bishop must be above
reproach:
We muSt remember that Paul is writing t0 '[imothy
when Timothy is at Ephesus (see
Tim
1.3, "remain at Ephesus"
and we already know from Acts 20 that there are elders at Ephesus
(Acts 20.17-38) . Furthermore
Timothy 5.17
we see thar
elders were
the church at Ephesus when Timothy was
because
says
"Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy
of double honor:'
Now the "bishops'
Timothy 31-2 also are t0
over the church at Ephesus because one qualification is that
"He must manage his own household well
for if
man does not
know how tO manage his own household, how can he care for
God'$ church?" (1 Tim: 3.4-5). So here it also seems that "bishop'
'overseer" is simply another term for
elder;
since these
"bishops'
fulfill the same function as elders quite clearly do
elsewhere in this epistle and in
Acts 20.
In Titus 1.5,
Paul tells Titus [0
appoint elders in every tOwn
and
gives some qualifications (v 6). Then in the very next sentence (v
7), he gives reasons for those qualifications
and he begins by
saying; "For
bishop, as God's steward, must be blameless_
again he uses the word "bishop" to refer to the elders whom Titus
was [0
appoint, giving another indication that the terms elder and
bishop were
interchangeable.
Finally; in Philippians 1.1
Paul writes
To all the saints in Christ
Jesus who are at Philippi; with the bishops and deacons
Here it
also seems appropriate to think that "bishops'
is another name for
ruling
there,
rule
Here
elders,
because there certainly were elders at Philippi; since it
Paul' $ practice t0 establish elders in every church (see Acts
14.23).
And if there were elders ruling in the church at Philippi, it is
unthinkable that Paul would write to the church and single out
bishops and deacons
but not elders
their offices were both
different from that of the elders.
Therefore, by "bishops and
deacons'
Paul must have meant the same
elders and
deacons_
Although in some parts of the church from the second
Lemluty
AD. onward_
the word bishop has been used t0 refer [0
single individual with authority over several churches_
this was
later development of the term and
not found in the New
Testament itself:
The Functions of Elders: One of the major roles of elders in the New
Testament is tO govern the New Testament churches. In
Timothy 5.17 we
read; "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor:`
Earlier in the same
Paul says that an overseer (0r elder)
'must manage
his Own household well,
his children submissive and respectful in
every way; for if
Mdl
does not know how
manage his own household,
how can he care for God's church?" (1 Tim. 3.4-5).
Peter also indicates
rling function for elders when he exhorts
them:
Tend the flock of God that is your
not by constraint but
willingly, not for shameful gain but eagerly, not as domineering over
those
your charge but being examples
the flock:
And when the
chief Shepherd is manifested yOu will obtain the unfading crown of
glory Likewise You that are younger be subject t0 the elders_
Peter
5.2-5)
The fact that they are t0 act as shepherds of the flock of God, and the fact that
are not to domineer (that is, not tO nule harshly or oppressively) strongly
suggest that elders have ruling Or governing functions in the churches
which Peter is writing: This is consistent with his
that especially those
who are younger should "be subject to the elders"
(v 5).
Although Hebrews 13.17 does not name
elders
certainly there are
some church officers with governing authority over the church, for
the author says; "Obey your leaders and submit I0 them; for they
keeping watch over your souls
as men who will have [0 give
account:
Since the New Testament gives no indication of any other
thing
epistle
keeping
charge,
they
charge
officers in the church with this kind of authority; it is reasonable
conclude that the congregation is to submit to and obey its elders
(This conclusion is also consistent with the description of
responsibilities Paul gives to the Ephesian elders in Acts 20.28.)
In addition t0 governing responsibility; elders also seem to have had
SUME
teaching responsibilities in the New Testament churches. In
Ephesians 4.11, elders are referred to as
pastor-teachers'
0n an
alternative translation, pastors who are viewed as quite closely
united t0 teachers):
And in
Timothy 3.2,
overseer (elder) must
an apt teacher:
Then in
Timothy 5.17, Paul says
"Let the
elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor;
especially those who labor in preaching and teaching
Here Paul
seems t0 imply thar there is
special group of elders who "labor in
preaching and teaching_
This means at least that there are some
among the elders who give more time
the activities of preaching
and teaching_
and may even mean that there are
SUME
who "labor"
in the sense of
their
from that
preaching and
teaching: The same conclusions can be drawn from Titus,
where
Paul says that an elder
must hold firm to the sure word as taught;
so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also
confute those who contradict it" (Titus 1.9).
Elders, then, had responsibility
rule and t0 teach in New
Testament churches_
Qualifications for Elders: When Paul lists the qualifications for elders_
significant that he combines requirements concerning character traits and
heart attitudes with requirements that cannot be fulfilled in
short time but
only become evident over
period of several years of faithful Christian
living:
Now
bishop must be above reproach, the husband of one wife,
temperate, sensible, dignified, hospitable; an apt teacher; no drunkard;
not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and no lover of money: He
muSt manage his own household well, keeping his children
submissive and respectful in every way; for if
man does not know
how tO manage his Own household_
how can he care for God's
church? He must not be
recent convert; or he may be puffed up with
conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil; moreover he must
be well thought of by outsiders; or he may fall into reproach and the
snare of the devil.
Tim. 32-7)
(0l;
earning
living
will
Similar but differently worded qualifications are found in Titus 1.6_
9, where Paul says that Titus is to appoint elders in every town:
If any man is blameless, the husband of one wife_
and his children are
believers and not open to the
of being profligate or
insubordinate. For
bishop
as God $ steward, must
be blameless; he
must not be arrogant 0r quick-tempered 0r

t0 the
sure
word as taught; so that he may be able to give instruction
sound doctrine and also t0 confute those who contradict ic ( Titus 1.6-
Those who are choosing elders in churches today would do well
look carefully at candidates in the light of these qualifications
and
to look for these character traits and patterns of
godly living rather
than worldly achievement; fame;
01 success- Especially in churches
in western industrial societies, there seems [0 be
tendency t0 think
that success in the world of business (0r law; 0r medicine, 0r
government) is an indication of suitability for the office of elder;
but this is not the teaching of the New Testament. It reminds 4s that
elders are t0 be
examples to the flock" in their daily lives_
and that
would certainly include their Own personal relationships with God
in Bible reading: prayer; and worship_
Just as Paul
say, "Be
imitators of me, as
am of Christ"
Cor: Il:1; cf:
Tim. %10-11) ,
and just as he could command Timothy t0 "set the believers an
example in speech and conduct; in love, in faith, in purity'
Tim.
4.12), and just as he could tell Titus, "Show
in all respects
model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity; gravity;
and sound speech that cannot be censured" (Titus 2.7), so the
pattern is to be continued in the lives of all church leaders today: It
not optional that their lives be examples for others t0 follow; it is
requirement:
What Is the Meaning of "Husband of One Wife"
The qualification "the
husband of one wife
(1 Tim. 3.2; Titus 1.6) has been understood in different
ways.
Some people have thought that it excludes from the office of elder men
who have been divorced and have then married someone else_
since
have
then been the husband of two wives But this does not seem
conecr
understanding of these verses:
better interpreration is that Paul was
prohibiting
polygamist (a man who presently has more than one wife) from
being an elder: Several reasons support this view: (1) All the other
charge
firtn
could
Yourself
they
qualifications listed by Paul refer to
man'$ present status_
not his entire past
life. For example
Timothy %1-7 does not mean
one who has never been
violent;
but
one who is not now violent; but gentle.
It does not mean
one
who has never been
lover of money;
but
one who is not now
lover of
money:'
It does not mean
one who has been above reproach for his whole
lite,
but
'one who is nOw above reproach:
If we made these qualifications
apply to one
entire past life_
then we would exclude from office almost
everyone who became
Christian as an adult; for it is doubtful that any non-
Christian could meet these qualifications_
(2) Paul could have said
been married only once
if he had
wanted tO, but he did not_
We should not prevent remarried
widowers from being elders
but that would be necessary if we take
the phrase
mean
been married only once
The
qualifications for elders are all based on
man'
moral and spiritual
character; and there is nothing in Scripture tO suggest that
man
who remarried after his wife had died has lower moral or spiritual
qualifications
Polygamy was possible in the
century:
Although
was not common, polygamy was practiced, especially
among the Jews
The Jewish historian Josephus says_
For it is an
ancestral custom of OurS t0 have several wives at the same time.
Rabbinic legislation also regulated inheritance Customs and other
aspects of polygamy:
Therefore
is best t0 understand "the husband of one wife
prohibit
polygamist from
the office of elder: The verses
say nothing about divorce and remarriage with respect tO
qualifications for church office:
f. The Public Installation of Elders: In connection with the discussion of
elders Paul says, "Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands" (1 Tim: 5.22).
Although the context does not specify
process of selection of elders
the
immediately preceding context
Tim: 5.17-21) deals entirely with elders,
and
laying on of hands would be an appropriate ceremony for
someone apart tO the office of elder
(note the laying on of hands to ordain or
establish people in certain offices 0r tasks in Acts 6.6; 13.3;
Tim. 4.14).
Therefore the setting apart of elders seems the most likely possibility for the
action Paul has in mind. In this case he would be saying; "Do not be hasty in
ordaining people as elders _
would be consistent with
process whereby
deacons also are t0 be "tested
then if
prove themselves blameless
let them serve as deacons"
Tim: 3.10). Although Paul did ordain elders

cautions that such appointment should not be rushed, lest
mistake be made.
And in the entire process, the church must be careful not t0 judge as the world
judges, for
man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the
heart"
Sam. 16.7; cf: 2 Cor: 5.16). This necessity for evaluation of spiritual
condition was also evident when the apostles encouraged the church at
Jerusalem t0 pick out
seven men of
good repute, full of the Spirit and of
wisdom; whom
may appoint t0 this duty" (Acts 6.3). Among those chosen
was "Stephen;
man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6.5).
We should also note that the appointment of elders in Paul $ early
churches was accompanied by
prayer and
perhaps in
connection with the process of selection of the elders_
(Note the
example of Jesus who
went out tO the mountain t0 pray; and all
night he continued in prayer to God" before he chose his twelve
disciples [Luke 6.12-13].)
3. Deacon: The word deacon is
translation of the Greek word diakonos,
which is the ordinary word for "servant" when it is used in contexts not
dealing with church officers.
Deacons are mentioned clearly in Philippians 1:15

mentioned in

more extensive passage:

And let them also be tested first; then if

The function of deacons is not spelled out here, but the
qualifications for deacons suggest some functions. For instance,
they seem t0 have had some
responsibility in caring for the
of the church; since they had t0 be people who were

because they were t0

also have ministered to the physical needs of those in the church or
community who needed help (see discussion of Acts
below)

think it does), then
would also be likely that

It would do no
for deacons if their wives (who
would no doubt also be involved in prayer and counseling with the
deacons) spread confidential matters around the church: But these
are only
suggestions of possible areas of responsibility hinted at in
this passage_
The noun deacon is not itself used in Acts 6.1-6, but
related verb

Here

Other Offices? In many churches today; there are other offices, such as
treasurer; moderator (one responsible for chairing church business meetings).

There does not seem t0 be any reason t0 say that these should not

though all of them could
probably be put in the category of either elder or deacon (most of
those mentioned above could be deacons with specific

or the moderator could also be an elder who simply

Nevertheless_
if these or
other similar offices seem helpful for the
functioning of the church,
there seems t0 be no reason why they should not be established. Yet
if they are established, it would be necessary t0 see that they not
overshadow the importance of the offices specifically named in
Scripture, and that they not have any authority that is not subject t0
the governing authority of those officers that are clearly named in
Scripture. If significant influence Or authority is gained by those
who have offices not named in Scripture; then it is much less likely
that people in the congregation Or the office holders themselves will
look t0 Scripture and
detailed descriptions of how they should
act or how they should be chosen This would tend t0 diminish the
effective authority of Scripture t0 govern the church in the area of
church leadership_

In the history of the church there have been two major types of
process for the selection of church officers
selection by
higher
authority; or selection by the local congregation. The Roman
Catholic Church has its officers appointed by
higher authority: the
appoints cardinals and bishops, and the bishops appoint
having "
paid

priests in local parishes.
This is
"hierarchy"
or" system of
government by
priesthood
that is distinct from the lay people in
the church: This system claims an unbroken line of descent from
Christ and the apostles, and claims that the present priesthood
stands as Christ'$ representatives in the church: Although the
Church of England (the Episcopalian Church in the United States)
does not submit to government by the
or' have cardinals
does have some similarities t0 the hierarchical system of the Roman
Catholic Church, since it is governed by bishops and archbishops_
and its
are thought of as priests
also claims direct
succession from the apostles, and priests and bishops are appointed
higher authority outside the local parish
In distinction from this system of appointment by higher authority;
most other Protestanc
groups church officers are chosen by the
local church,
by some group within the local church, even
though the form of church goverment may vary in other
significant ways (see below) Since this is an area in which there is
no absolutely decisive biblical text,
ought to be patient with
some
diversity among evangelicals on this issue: However; there
are several
reasons why
seems most appropriate that church
officers (such as elder and deacon, and certainly including the
pastor") should be chosen or at least affirmed 0r recognized in
some way by the whole
congregation:
(1) In the New Testament, there are several examples where church
officers were apparently chosen by the whole congregation_
Acts
6.3, the apostles do not themselves pick out the seven early deacons
(if we see them as deacons), but say t0 the whole church; "Pick OUt
from among YOu seven men of
repute; full of the Spirit and of
wisdom; whom we may
appoint to this
The initial selection
of these men was done by the whole congregation. When
replacement was chosen for Judas t0 be numbered among the
apostles, the whole congregation of 120 persons (see Acts 1:15)
made the initial selection of two
from whom the Lord himself
indicated which one he would appoint:
And they put forward two

(Acts 15.22; cf: "in assembly;

some of the churches sent an offering with Paul to be taken to the

according to Paul; "has been appointed

may be objected that Paul and Barnabas

every church (Acts 14.23), and Paul also told Titus to
appoint
elders in every tOwn
(Titus 1.5). Does this not seem more like the
Roman Catholic 0r
Anglican system than
system of
congregational choice? Yet even those verses need not imply that
the apostles alone made the selection, but could certainly include
congregational consultation and even consent before an official
appointment Or installation was made (as with the appointment in
Acts 6.3,6). The word appoint may also mean "install_
(2) Another reason for
congregational participation in the selection
of church officers
that in the New Testament generally; final
governing authority seems
rest not with any group outside the
church or any group within the church; but with the church as
whole. The final step in church discipline before excommunication
is [0

(Matt: 18.17). Excommunication, 0r the
act of
excluding =
someone from the fellowship of the church; is done
when the whole
congregation is
assembled"
Cor: 5.4), and is
therefore apparently done by the entire congregation. One other
consideration that is
suggestive; but not conclusive_
the fact thar
the epistles that are written to churches are not sent to the elders or
SUME
other group of leaders within the churches_
but are all written
entire churches, and the whole congregation is encouraged to
read and expected t0 give heed to these epistles (Rom: 1.7;
Cor:
12;
Cor: 1:1; cf:
Cor: 1.13; Col. 4.16;
Tim: 413). This means
that the apostles relate directly to the congregations, not t0 the
congregations through the officers_
There are also some
practical reasons that can be mentioned:
(3) If the entire congregation selects the officers of the church, there
is more accountability t0 the
congregation:
Paul assumed some
level of accountability when he provided for the fact that
[WO Or
three witnesses
could bring
charge of wrongdoing against an
elder (1 Tim. 5.19). This accountability provides an additional
safeguard against temptations
sin and excessive lust for power:
Historically, false doctrine often seems to be adopted by the
theologians of the church first, by the pastors second
and by the
informed laity; who are daily reading their Bibles and walking with
the Lord,
last Therefore, if the leadership begins tO stray in
doctrine 0r in life, and there is no election by the
congregation, then
the church as
whole has no practical means of getting hold of the
situation and tumning
around
But if officers are elected by the
church, then there is
system of
checks and balances" whereby
evem
the governing authority of the church has some accountability
t0 the church as
whole_
Government works best when it has the consent of those
governed (cf:
in the Old Testament; Ex 4.29-31;
Sam: 7.5-6;
10.24;
Sam 2.4;
Kings 1.39-40; and note the mistake of
Rehoboam in
Kings 12.1, 15).
These factors combine t0 indicate that although Scripture does not
explicitly command one specific system of
choosing church
officers
it would seem most wise t0 have
system whereby the
entire church has
significant role in the selection and recognition
of the officers of the church
perhaps through
congregational
vote ,
through some other process whereby congregational
recognition is required before church officers can assume office_
Can
anything else be said about the process of
selecting officers?
Some additional congregational
checks
against excessive use of
authority might be built into the selection process_
There is room
for wide variation here_
but provisions such as election t0 limited
terms of office,
requirement fOr .
mandatory year off (except for
full-time pastoral staff members who are elders) every few years_
requirement for periodic reaffirmation of election; and
provision
in the nominating process whereby nominations can be made by the
members of the congregation (even
most nominations come tTOm
the elders themselves) , would all provide additional measures of
accountability tO the
congregation without forfeiting any essential
aspects of governing authority over the congregation once elders
are elected_
These factors would also provide some arguments against
self-
perpetuating group of elders which is not subject to election 0r
periodic reconfirmation by the congregation, but once again it must
be said that no specific directives are listed in Scripture and there is
room for variation at this point:

In discussing forms of church government there is some overlap
with the previous section on the method of
choosing church
officers
for the selection of officers
one very important aspect of
authority in the church: Different philosophies of church
government will be reflected in different methods used for
selecting
officers of the church; as explained above.
This is evident in the fact that forms of church government can be
broken down into three
categories
which
may term
"episcopalian;
presbyterian,
and
congregational '
The
episcopalian forms have
government by
distinct category of
church officers known as
priesthood, and final authority for
decision-making is found outside the local church
The Episcopal
Church system is the primary representative among Protestants of
this form of government The presbyterian forms have
government by elders; some of whom have authority not only over
their local congregation, but also, through the presbytery and the
general assembly; over all the churches in
region and then in the
denomination as
whole_
The congregational forms of church
government all have final governing authority resting with the local
congregation, although various degrees of self-rule are given up
through denominationa)
affiliation
and the actual form of local
church goverment may vary considerably We shall examine each
of these forms of government in the
following discussion
1. Episcopalian:
In the episcopalian system, an archbishop has authority over many
bishops. They in turn have authority over
~diocese
which simply
means the churches under the jurisdiction of

The officer

rector (0r sometimes
vicar;, who is

Or' one who substitutes for the rector). Archbishops,
bishops_
and rectors are all priests; since
have all at one time
been ordained to the episcopalian priesthood (but in practice the

The argument for the episcopalian system
not that
is found in
the New Testament; but that it is
natural
outgrowth of the
development of the church which began in the New Testament; and
it is not forbidden by the
Testament E A.
Litton writes_
order of Diocesan Bishops appears in the New Testament;
but
immediately adds:
The evidence is in favour of the supposition that Episcopacy sprang
from the Church itself; and by
natural
process; and that it was
sanctioned by Saint John; the last survivor of the Apostles. The
Presbytery; when it assembled for consultation,
naturally elect

permanent authority.

Moreover; since the office of bishop and the
corresponding
government structure found in the Episcopalian Church is both
historical and beneficial, Litton argues that
should be preserved_
Finally; the benefit of direct descent from the apostles is
regarded as
strong reason in favor of the episcopalian system_
Litton says,
"The Apostles are the first link in the chain, and there is nO reason
why
succession; as
regards to the external commission, should not
proceed from age t0 age, the

as Litton himself agrees_
There is no single
bishop in the New Testament; but bishops (Or overseers

plural in number: This should not be seen merely as an incidental
for even among the apostles Jesus did not leave one with
superior authority over the others
but left a group of twelve who
were
equal in governing authority (and tO whom others were later
added, such as Paul)
Though some apostles, such as Peter; James_
and Paul; had prominence among the group, they did not have any
greater authority than the others_
and even Peter was rebuked by
Paul in Antioch (Gal: 2.11).
This may well reflect the wisdom of
Christ in guarding against the abuse of power that inevitably comes
when any one human being has too much power without sufficient
checks and balances from others. Just aS Jesus left

apostles [0 have ultimate (human) authority in the early church; sO
the apostles always appointed

never
only one person with governing authority:
The theory of a group of bishops established to replace the
apostles is not taught in the
[estament; nor is there an
implication of
need for physical continuity of ordination through
the laying on of hands by those who have been ordained in an
unbroken chain of succession
the apostles. For example; in
Acts 14.3_
it was not the Jerusalem apostles who ordained Paul and
Barnabas
but people in the church at Antioch who laid hands on
them and sent them out_ In fact; there is
little evidence that the
apostles had any concern for
line of succession: Timothy
apparently was ordained not simply by Paul but also by
council
of elders
Tim. 4.14), though this may well have included Paul
as well (see
Tim. 1:6). More importantly, ordaining is ultimately
the Lord himself (Acts 20.28;
Cor: 12.28; Eph. 411), and
there
in the nature of
ordaining" (when it is simply seen
public recognition of an office) that requires that it be done only
by those previously ordained in physical descent from the apostles.
If God has called an elder; he is t0 be
recognized, and no concern
about
physical descent needs t0 be raised In addition, if one is
convinced thar the local
church should elect elders (see discussion
above), then
would seem appropriate that the church that elected

While it may be
argued that the development of an episcopalian

deviation from New Testament standards and
result of
human dissatisfaction with the system of elected local elders that
had been established by the apostles and that had apparently
worked very well from AD. 30 to 100 throughout all of the New
Testament church_
But one'$ evaluation of the historical data will of
course depend on one
evaluation of earlier arguments for and
against an episcopalian system
2. Presbyterian: In this system, each local church elects elders t0

in figure 47.2 stands for elder; and the dotted lines indicate that the whole
congregation elects the elders) The pastor of the church will be one of the
elders in the session, equal in authority t0 the other elders
This session has

However; the members of the
session (the elders) are also members of

This presbytery consists of some or all of
the elders
the local churches over which it has authority Moreover; some of
the members of the presbytery are members of the
general assembly" which
usually
have authority over all the presbyterian churches in _
nation Or
region.
The arguments in favor of this presbyterian system are=
(1) that
those who have wisdom and gifts for eldership should be called on
tO use their wisdom to
govern more than just one local church; and
national (or even worldwide) government of the church shows
the unity of the body of Christ: Moreover (3) such
system is able
to prevent an individual
congregation from
into doctrinal
much more etfectively than any voluntary association of
churches
The presbyterian system outlined above has many adherents among
evangelical Christians today, and
certainly works effectively in
many cases
However; some objections can be brought against this
system:
Nowhere in Scripture do elders have
regularly
established authority over more than their own local church: The
pattern is rather that elders are appointed in local churches and have
authority over local churches_
Against this claim the Jerusalem
council in Acts 15 is often mentioned_
but we should notice that this
council was held in Jerusalem because of the presence of the
will
falling "
enor
apostles. Apparently the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem; with
the representatives from Antioch (Acts 15.2),
sought God $
wisdom on this matter:
And there seems [0 have been some
consultation with the whole church as well, for we read, at the
conclusion of the discussion; " Then
seemed
t0 the apostles
and the elders
with the whole church; t0 choose men from among
them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas" (Acts
15.22). (If this narrative gives support to regional government by
elders, it therefore also gives support t0 regional government by
whole congregations!) This situation with the elders in Jerusalem is
not
good pattern to defend
system whereby elders have
authority over more than their local churches: the Jerusalem church
did not send for all the
Iders in Judea, Samaria_
and Galilee, and
call
meeting of "the Judean presbytery'
general assembly:
Although the apostles in Jerusalem certainly had authority over all
the churches, there
no indication that elders by themselves, even
in the Jerusalem church, had any such authority: And certainly there
is no New Testament pattern for elders
exercising authority over
any other than their own local churches_
PRESBYTERIAN GOVERNMENT
Fiyure 47.2
This system, in practice, results in much formal
litigation, where
doctrinal disputes are pursued year after year all the way t0 the
level of the genera
assembly. One wonders if this should be
characteristic of the church of Christ
perhaps s0, but ir seems t0
the present author to be
system that encourages such litigation far
more than is necessary
edifying for the body of Christ:
The effective power in church government seems, in practice,
be too removed from the final control of the lay people in the
church: Although Berkhof; who defends this system of government;
affirms quite clearly that "the power of the church resides primarily
in the governing body of the local
church
he also admits

the more general
the assembly; the more remote it is from the

Thus the system
hard t0 turn around when it
begins
g0 wrong since the lay persons who are not elders have no
vote in the session Or the presbytery Or the general assembly; and
the governing structure of the church is more removed from them
than in other church government structures
(4) Although in some cases it is true that
doctrinally sound
denomination with
presbyterian system of government can keep
local church from going astray in its doctrine_
in actuality very
frequently the opposite has been true: the national leadership of
presbyterian denomination has adopted false doctrine and has put
pressure 0n local churches
conform [0 iL.
(5) Although the presbyterian system does represent in one form the
national or even worldwide unity of Christ $ church, such unity can
certainly be shown
other ways than through this system of
government: The churches with more purely congregational forms
of government do have voluntary associations that manifest this
unity. In fact; these associations involve all the people in the
churches_
just the elders or the
as in
presbyterian
system. The national meeting of _
Baptist denomination_
for
example,
where large numbers of ministers and lay persons (who
not necessarily elders Or deacons, but just delegates
their
churches) join together in fellowship might be seen as
better
demonstration of the unity
Christ's body than
presbyterian
genera
assembly where only elders are present:
3. Congregational:
Elder (or Single Pastor): We can nOw look at five varieties of
congregational government for the church_
The first one, which is currently
the most common among Baptist churches in the United States, is the "single
elder" form of government: In this kind of government the pastor is seen as
the only elder in the church; and there is an elected board of deacons who
serve under his authority and give suppOrt to him (D in figure 47_

SINGLC-ELDER (SINGLE-PASTOR) GOVERNMENT
Fiyure 47.3
In this system; the
congregation elects the pastor and also elects the
deacons. The amount of authority the pastor has varies greatly from
church to church, and will generally increase the longer
pastor
remains in
church: The authority of the deacon board is often
thought to be merely an advisory authority. In the way this system
ordinarily functions, especially in smaller churches_
many decisions
must be brought before the
congregation as
whole:
The arguments in favor of this system are clearly presented in A. H:
Strong $ Systematic Theology;
text that has been widely used in
Baptist circles_
Strong gives the following arguments:
The New Testament does not require
plurality of elders, but
the pattern of plural elders seen in the New Testament was only due
the size of the churches at that time. He says:
In certain of the New Testament churches there appears t0 have been
plurality of elders.
There is, however; no evidence that the number
of elders was uniform; r that the plurality which frequently existed
was due t0 any other cause than the size of the churches for which
these elders cared: The New Testament example_
while
permits the
multiplication of assistant pastors according t0 need
does not require
plural eldership in every case
In this quotation Strong shows that he would regard additional pastors hired
larger church to be elders as well, so that this system could be expanded
beyond
single elder/pastor to include two Or more elder pastors. But the
crucial distinction
that the governing authority of the office of elder is
possessed only by the professional pastor(s) of the church, and is not shared
by any lay persons in the church And we must realize that in practice, the
vast majority of churches that follow this pattern today are relatively small
churches with only one pastor; therefore, in actuality; this usually becomes
single elder form of government
Strong adds that
James was the pastor Or president of the
church at Jenusalem;
and cites Acts 12.17; 21.18; and Galatians
2.12 t0 show that this leadership by James was
pattern which
could then be imitated by other churches_
Strong notes that some passages have "bishop
in the singular
but
deacons" in the plural, hinting at something similar t0 this
common
Baptist form of government
literal translation of the
Greek text shows
singular definite article modifying "bishop'
[WO verses_
The bishop therefore must be without reproach"
Tim_
3.2,literal translation) and that "the bishop must be
blameless'
(Titus 1:7, literal translation), but by contrast; we read_
"Deacons likewise must be serious
(1 Tim. 3.8).
Finally, the
angel of the church" in Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18;
3:1,7, 14, according to Strong;
"is best interpreted as meaning the
pastor of the church; and, if this be correct; it is clear that each
church had,
nOr many pastors
but one
(5) Another argument; not made by Strong
is found in recent
literature on church growth
[he argument is that churches need
strong single pastor in order tO grow rapidly
Once again it must be said that this single elder form of government
has also worked very successfully in many
evangelical churches
However; there can be objections t0 the case presented by
Strong
and others _
It seems inconsistent [O argue that the New Testament falls short
of giving
clear command that all churches should have
plurality

officers today: How can churches say that the qualifications

these verses are commanded for US today but the
system of plural elders found in these very same verses is nOt
commanded, but was required only in that time and in that sociery?
Though
could be objected that these are commands written only
individual situations in Ephesus and Crete_
much of the New
Testament consists of apostolic commands written t0 individual
churches on how they should conduct themselves. Yet we do not
therefore say that we are free
disobey these instructions
other
parts of the epistles_
In fact;
Timothy and Titus give 4S
great
deal of material on the conduct of the local church, material which
all believing churches seek to follow:
Moreover; it seems to be quite unwise t0 ignore
clear New
Testament pattern which existed throughout all the churches for
which we have evidence at the time the New Testament was
written:
When the New Testament shows US that no church was
seen [0 have

Acts 14.23; "in every
[OWI,
Titus 1.5; "let him call for the elders,
James 5.14;
exhort
the elders among you;
Peter 5.1), then
seems unpersuasive t0
say that smaller churches would have only had one elder: Even
when Paul had just founded churches on his first missionary
journey; there were elders appointed "in every church" (Acts
14.23). And
tOwn'
on the island of Crete was t0 have elders,
no matter how
or small the church was
In addition; there is an inconsistency in Strong
argument when he
says that the large churches were those which had plural elders, for
then he claims thar "the
angel of the church in Ephesus'
(Rev 2.1)
was
single pastor; according t0 this common Baptist pattern: Yet
the church at Ephesus at that time was exceptionally
Paul, in
founding that church
had spent three years there (Acts 20.31),
which time "all the residents of Asia heard the word of the
Lord, both Jews and Greeks" (Acts 19.10). The population of
Ephesus at that time was more than 250,000.
We may ask; why should we follow Strong and adopt as the norm
pattern of church government which is nowhere found
the New
Testament; and reject
pattern everywhere found in the New
Testament?
James may well have acted as moderator or
presiding officer in
the church
Jerusalem, for all churches will have some kind of
designated leader like this in order t0 conduct meetings. But this
does not imply that he was the "pastor" of the church in Jerusalem

Acts 15.2 shows that there were
elders (plural) in the church in Jerusalem, and James himself was
probably numbered among the apostles (see Gal. 1:19) rather than
the elders_
Timothy 3.2 and
1.7, the Greek definite article
modifying "bishop'
simply shows that Paul is speaking of general
qualifications as they applied to any one example
In fact; in both
cases which Strong cites we know there were elders (plural) in the
churches involved:
Timothy 3.2 is written t0 Timothy at Ephesus,
and Acts 20:17 shows uS thar there were
elders'
in the church at
Ephesus_
And even in
Timothy; Paul writes, "Let the elders who
rule well be considered worthy of double honor; especially those
who labor in
preaching and teaching" (1 Tim: 5.17) With regard to
Titus 1:7 we need only look t0 verse 5, where Paul directs Titus
explicitly tO
appoint elders in every town.
The angels of the seven churches in Revelation 2-3 are unusual
and rather weak evidence for single elders_
The angel of the
church in Ephesus
(Rev: 2:1) can hardly mean that there was only
one
elder in that church; since we know there were

there in
this very
church (Acts 20.17).

It is interesting that all of the New Testament passages cited by
Strong (Acts 15, Jerusalem;
Tim. 3.2 , Ephesus; Titus 1.7, Crete;
Rev 2-3,the seven churches, including Ephesus) speak of
situations in which the New Testament itself points quite clearly tO

The argument from church growth studies does not really prove
that government led by

reasons: (a) We should not reject

different one just because people tell us that the
different pattern seems

Scripture as

churches with government by

churches) , so the argument from pragmatic considerations is not
conclusive_
(c) C. Peter
Wagner admits that strong leaders can be
found in various forms of church government;
and we muSt agree
that
system of plural elders in which all have equal authority does
prevent one elder (such as the pastor) from
functioning
SOII
first among equals'
and having
significant leadership role
among those elders
common
practical problem with
"single elder" system is
either an excessive concentration of power in one person OF
excessive demands laid upon him_
In either case_
the temptations
sin are very great, and
lessened
degree of accountability makes
yielding to temptation more likely As was mentioned above, it was
never the pattemn in the New Testament; even with the apostles,

Here
should be noted that the "single elder" view of church
government really has no more New Testament support than the
"single bishop'
(episcopalian) view: Both seem to be attempts [0
justify what has already happened in the history of the church; not
conclusions that have grown out of an inductive examination of the
New Testament itself.
Finally; it should be noted that in actual practice the "single
elder" system can change and function more like
plural elders
government, only those who function as elders are instead called
deacons.
This would happen if the deacons share the actual
governing authority with the pastor; and the pastor and other
deacons see themselves as accountable t0 the deacon board as
whole_
The system then
begins to look like figure 47.4.

situation is
that people in the church (both the deacons and the other church

Therefore these passages lose the direct relevance that
should

solved by changing the name

the pastor an elder along with the others:
Plural Local Elders: Is there any kind of church goverment that
preserves the pattern of plural elders found in the New Testament and that
avoids the expansion of elders
authority beyond the local
congregation?
Although such
system is nOt distinctive of any denomination today; it is
found in many individual congregations. Using the conclusions reached to
this point on the New Testament data
would suggest figure 47.5 as
possible pattern.

within such
system the elders govem the church and have
authority t0 rule over it, authority which has been conferred Dy
Christ himself; the head of the church; and by the Holy Spirit (Acts
20.28; Heb. 13.17). In this system of government; there is always

than one elder;
fact which distinguishes this form of
government from the
single elder system'
discussed above. In
contemporary congregation, the "pastor" (or
senior

would
be one among the elders in this system: He does not have authority
Uvei
them; nor does he work for them as an employee_
He has
somewhat distinct role in that he is
engaged in the full-time work of
"preaching and teaching" (1 Tim. 5.17), and derives part or all of
his income from that work
Tim 5.18) . He also may frequently
assume
eadership role (such as chairman) among the elders_
which would fit with his leadership role among the congregation_
but such
leadership role among the elders would not be necessary
the system.
addition_
the pastor will ordinarily have
considerable authority t0 make decisions and provide leadership in
many areas of responsibility that have been delegated to him by the
elder board as
whole: Such
system would allow
pastor to
exercise strong leadership in the church while still having equal
governing authority with the other elders_
The strength of this system of government is seen in the fact that
the pastor does not have authority on his Own over the
congregation, but that authority belongs collectively to the entire
group of elders (what may be called the elder board)_
Moreover, the
pastor himself; like
other elder; is subject tO the authority of
the elder board as
whole.
This can be
great benefit in
pastor from making mistakes_
and in supporting him in adversity
and protecting him from attacks and opposition:
In such
system, are there limitations that should be placed on the
authority of the elders? In the section above on the manner
choosing church officers
severab
reasons were
given to have some
"checks and balances" that would put restrictions on the authority
of the officers of
church:
Those arguments are also helpful here
indicating-
though elders have substantial governing
authority over the church;
should not be unlimited authority.
Examples of such limitations might be suggested
such as: ( 1) they
every
keeping
that;
may be elected rather than
self-perpetuating;
may have
specific terms with
mandatory year off the board (except for the
pastor; whose continuing leadership responsibilities require
continuous participation as an elder); (3) some
decisions may
be required to be brought
the whole church for approval
Regarding this third point; congregational approval is already
biblicaB
requirement for church discipline in Matthew 18.17 and for
excommunication in
Corinthians 5.4. The principle of
congregational election of elders would imply that the decision to
call any pastor would also have to be approved by the congregation
whole. Major new directions in the ministry of the church;
which will require
~scale congregational support; may be
brought tO the church as
whole for approval. Finally;
would
seem wise [0
require congr
approval on such
financial decisions as an annual budget; the decision t0 purchase
property; or the decision to borrow money for the church (if that is
ever
done), simply because the church as
whole will be asked tO
give generously to pay for these commitments_
In fact; the reasons for placing some limitations on the authority of
church officers may appear S0 strong that they would lead us to
think that all decisions and all
governing authority should rest with
the congregation as
whole.
(Some churches have adopted
system of almost pure democracy in goveming the church; whereby
everything
muSt come t0 the congregation as
whole for approval )
However; this conclusion ignores the abundant
Testament
evidence about the clear ruling and governing authority given t0
elders in New Testament churches
Therefore
while it is important
t0 have some
recognized checks on the authority of elders
and [0
rest ultimate governing authority with the congregation as
whole,
it still is necessary; if we are [0 remain faithful t0 the New
Testament pattern, to have
strong level of authority vested in the
elders themselves_
[have labeled this system one of "plural local elders'
in order [0
distinguish it from
presbyterian system where elders_
when
gathered on the level of the presbytery Or general assembly, have
authority

can there be any wider associations

have over the local congregation would be the authority t0 exclude
an individual church from the association; not the authority to
govern its individual affairs
Corporate Board: The remaining three forms of congregational church
government are not commonly used, but are sometimes found in evangelical
churches_

has authority t0 run the business as he sees fit: This form of government could

It is depicted in figure 47.6.

In favor of this structure it might be argued that this system in fact
works well in contemporary businesses. However; there is no New

the church like
modern business, and it sees the pastor not as

Further objections
this structure are the fact that it deprives the
pastor of sharing
the ruling authority that must be his if he is t0

members of the board are also members of the congregation over
whom the pastor is supposed to have some authority; but that
authority is seriously compromised if the

In this system everything must come t0 the cong

The result is that decisions are often argued endlessly; and, as the
church grows
decision-making reaches
point of near paralysis_
While this structure does attempt t0 do justice t0 some of the
passages cited above regarding the need for final governing
authority t0 rest with the congregation as
whole; it is unfaithful to
the
Testament pattern of recognized and designated elders who
have actual authority t0 rule the church in most situations.

Conclusions. It must be made clear; in
concluding this discussion of
church goverment, that the form of government adopted by
church is not a
major point of doctrine. Christians have lived comfortably and ministered
very effectively within several different kinds of systems, and there are many
evangelicals within each of the systems mentioned. Moreover;

Most systematic theologies have not included
section on the
question of whether women can be church officers_
because it has
been assumed through the history of the church; with very few
exceptions_
thar only men could be pastors 0r function as elders
within
church:
But in recent years
major controversy has
arisen within the
evangelical world: may women as well as men be
pastors? May they share in all the offices of the church?
have
treated this question much more extensively elsewhere
but
brief
summary of the question can be given at this point
We must affirm at the outset that the creation narrative in Genesis
1.27 views men and women as equally created in the image of God:
Therefore , men and women have equal value to God
and should be
seen by US as having absolutely equal value
persons_
and equal
value t0 the church Moreover; Scripture assures men and women
of equal access to all the blessings of salvation (see Acts 2.17-18;
Gal: 3.28).
This is remarkably affirmed in the high dignity and
respect which Jesus accorded t0 women in his earthly ministry:
We must also admit that
evangelical churches have often failed to
recognize the full equality of men and women, and thereby have
failed t0 count women equal in value
men. The result has been
tragic failure to recognize that God often gives women equal
will
greater spiritual gifts than men,
failure tO encourage women to
have full and free participation in the various ministries of the
church, and
failure t0 take full account of the wisdom that God
has given t0 women with respect tO important decisions in the life
of the church: If the present controversy over women'$ roles in the
church can result in the eradication of some of these past abuses,
then the church as
whole will benefit greatly:
Yet the question remains
should women be pastors 0r elders in
churches? (Or should they fill roles equivalent to that of an elder in
churches that have alternative forms of government?) My own
conclusion on this issue is that the Bible does not permit women t0
function in the role of pastor
elder within
church. This has also
been the conclusion of the vast majority of churches in various
societies throughout history. The reasons that seem t0 me t0 be
MOSL
persuasive
answering this question are the following:
1. 1 Timothy 2:11-14_
The single passage in Scripture that addresses this
question most directly is
Timothy 2.11-14:
Let -
woman leam in silence with all submissiveness_
permit no
woman [0 teach or [0 have
authority over men; she is t0
silent.
For Adam was formed
then Eve
and Adam was not deceived;
but the woman
deceived and became
transgressor:
Here Paul is
speaking about the church when it is assembled (see
vv: 8-9). In such
setting; Paul says_
permit no woman t0 teach
or t0 have authority over men
12). These are the functions that
are carried out by the elders of the church; and especially by what
we Know as
pastor in contemporary church situations
Ic is
specifically these functions unique
elders that Paul
prohibits for
women in the church:
Several objections have been brought against this position:
(a) It has been said that this passage applies only to
specific
situation that Paul is addressing
probably one where women were
teaching heretical doctrine within the church at Ephesus. But this
objection is not persuasive, since there is no clear statement in
Timothy that says that women
actually teaching false
doctrines.
Tim. 5.13 talks about women who are gossiping, but
keep
tirst,
Were
does not mention false doctrine.
Moreover; Paul does not simply
tell certain women who are
teaching false doctrine to be silent; but
he says;
permit no woman [0 teach or to have authority over
men.
And finally, the reason Paul gives for this prohibition is not
the one proposed in this objection; but
far different one
situation of
Adam and Eve before the fall, and before there was any
sin in the world (see
13), and the way in which
reversal in male
and female roles occured at the time of the fall (see
14). These
reasons are not limited t0 one situation in the church at Ephesus;
but have
application t0 manhood and womanhood generally:
(b) Another objection
to say that Paul gave this prohibition
because women were not well educated in the first century; and
therefore Were not qualified for teaching 0r governing roles in the
church: But Paul does nOt give lack of education as
reason for
saying that women cannot "teach 0r
have authority over men;
but rather points back t0 creation (vV 13-14). It is precarious
base an argument on
reason Paul did not give instead of the
reason he did give
In addition, this objection misunderstands the actual facts of the
ancient church and the ancient world. Forma)
in Scripture
was not
required for church leadership in the New Testament
church, because several of the apostles did not have formal biblical
training (see Acts 4.13). On the other hand
the skills of basic
literacy and therefore the ability t0 read and study Scripture were
available t0 men and women alike (note Acts 18.26; Rom: 16.1;
Tim_
2.11; [itus 2.3
There were many well-educated women in
the ancient world, and particularly in
cultural center such as
Ephesus_
Finally; those who make such an argument are sometimes
inconsistent in that elsewhere
point tO women who had
leadership positions in the ancient church, such as Priscilla
This
is especially relevant t0
Timothy 2
because Paul was
Ephesus (1 Tim: 1.3), which was the home church of
Priscilla and Aquila (see Acts 18.18-19,21). It was in this very
church at Ephesus that Priscilla knew Scripture well enough to help
instruct Apollos in AD.51 (Acts 18.26). Then she had probably
leared from Paul himself for another three years while he stayed at
Ephesus teaching "the whole counsel of God" (Acts 20.27; cf:
31; also
Cor: 16.19). No doubt many other women in Ephesus had
training
they
point
writing `
followed her example and also had learned from Paul: Although
they later went tO Rome; we find Aquila and Priscilla back in
Ephesus at the end of Paul's life (2 Tim. 4.19), about AD. 67_
Therefore, it is likely that
were in Ephesus in A.D_
about
the time Paul wrote
Timothy (about fourteen years after Priscilla
had helped instruct Apollos). Yet Paul does not allow even well-
educated Priscilla or any other well-educated women at Ephesus to
teach men in the public assembly of the church
The reason was not
lack of education, but the order of creation which God established
between men and women:
Corinthians 14:33b-36. In
similar teaching
Paul says:
As in all the churches of the saints
the women should keep silence in
the churches. For
are not
permitted to speak; but should be
subordinate
as even the law says: If there
anything
desire t0
know; let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for _
woman [0
speak in church: What! Did the word of God originate with
YOu;
or are YOu the only ones it has reached?
Cor: 14.33b-36)
In this section Paul cannot be prohibiting all public speech by women in the
church, for he clearly allows them t0 pray and prophesy in church in
Corinthians 11.5.
Therefore, it is best to understand this passage as referring
speech that is in the category being discussed in the immediate context;
namely; the spoken evaluation and judging of prophecies in the congregation
(see
29: "Let two 01 three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is
said
While Paul allows women to speak and give prophecies in the church
meeting
he does not allow them to speak up and give evaluations 0r critiques
of the prophecies that have been given, for this would be
ruling or
governing function with respect t0 the whole church_
This understanding of
the passage depends on Our view of the gift of prophecy in the New
Testament age_
namely; that prophecy involves not authoritative Bible
teaching
and not
speaking words of God which are equal to Scripture; but
rather reporting something which God spontaneously
to mind
In this
way; Paul's
teachings _
are quite consistent in
Corinthians 14 and
Timothy
2: in both cases he is concemed t0 preserve male leadership in the
and
governing of the church
Timothy 3.1-7 and Titus 1:5-9. Both
Timothy %1-7 and Titus 1.5-9
assume that elders are going to be men.
An elder (or bishop/overseer) must be
"the husband of one wife" (1 Tim: 3.2; also Titus 1:6), and
'must manage his
they -
they
they
brings
teaching
own household well;
his children submissive and respectful in every
way
Tim. 3.4).
Some may object that these were directions given only for the
cultural situation in the ancient world_
where women were nOr well
educated, but the same response that was given above concerning
Timothy
would apply in this case as well
The Relationship Between the Family and the Church_
The New
Testament makes frequent connections between the life of the family and the
life of the church_
Paul says,; "If
man does not know how tO manage his Own
household, how can he care for God $ church?"
Tim. 3.5). He says t0
'Timothy;
Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as YOU would
father ;
youngel
men like brothers, Older women like motners, younger women
like sisters; in all purity" (1 Tim: 5.1-2)
Several other passages could be
cited, but the close relationship between the family and the church should be
clear:
Because of this connection; it is inevitable that leadership pattems
in the family will reflect leadership patterns in the church; and vice
versa. It is
appropriate that; as godly men fulfill their
leadership responsibilities in the family;
should also fulfill
leadership responsibilities in the church: Conversely;
patterns of
female leadership are established in the church
will inevitably
bring pressures toward greater female leadership; and toward
abdication of male leadership_
within the family:
The Example of the Apostles: While the apostles are not the same as
elders in local churches, it is still important tO realize that Jesus established
pattern of male leadership in the church when he appointed twelve men as
apostles- It is simply not [ue that women have equal
access t0 all offices in
the church; for Jesus_
the head of the church; is
man_
And the [welve
apostles who will sit On twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (see
Matt_ 19.28), and whose names are Written forever 0n the foundations of the
heavenly city (Rev 21.14), are all men. Therefore, there
be no eternal
modeling of equal roles for men and women at all levels of authority in the
church. Rather; there is
pattern of male leadership in the highest governing
roles of the church,
pattern that will be evident t0 all believers for all
eterity.
One objection brought against this argument is the claim that the
culture at that time would not have allowed Jesus t0 choose six men
keeping
neat
very
they
will.
and six women as apostles,
six husband-wife teams as apostles
and this is the reason he did not do so. But such an objection
impugns Jesus' integrity and courage. Jesus was not afraid to break
social customs when
moral principle was
stake: he criticized
the Pharisees publicly; healed on the Sabbath; cleansed the temple
spoke with
Samaritan woman; ate with tax collectors and sinners_
and ate with unwashed hands.
If Jesus had wanted t0 establish
principle of
access t0 church leadership by both men and
women, he certainly could have done so in the appointment of his
apostles, and he would have done s0, in spite of cultural opposition,
if it had been the pattern he wanted t0 establish in his church: But
he did not:
Another objection tO this argument is tO say
if this is true, then
only Jews can be leaders in our churches, since all twelve apostles
were Jewish as well.
But this objection is not persuasive because
fails t0
recognize that the church was entirely Jewish at its
beginning: This was because it was God'$ plan to bring salvation
through the Jews_
and this led to twelve Jewish apostles. Yet within
the pages of the New Testament; we see that the church soon
expanded t0 include Gentiles (Matt: 28.19; Eph: 2.16) and Gentiles
SuUI
became elders and leaders in the New Testament church:
Gentile (Luke) wrote [WO
books of the New Testament (Luke and
Acts), and several Gentiles such as Titus and Epaphroditus were
Paul s apostolic assistants and cO-workers_
In fact; God had
progressively revealed from the time of Abraham (Gen. 12.3; 17.5)
that
was his plan eventually tO include countless Gentiles among
his people
So the Jewishness of the early apostles is not like their maleness_
The church began as entirely Jewish; but soon became Jewish and
Gentile as well. But the church did not begin all male
and only
later include females as well. Christ $ followers were male and
female from the
beginning
and both men and women were present
at the beginning of the church at Pentecost So this objection
nol
persuasive either:

Bible_
Sometimes opponents of the view presented here have said it is based
only on one text;
Timothy
Several of the foregoing arguments have
demonstrated that this is nOr the case, but there
one further argument that
equal
thal ,
can be made: throughout the history of the entire Bible, from Genesis t0
Revelation, there is
consistent pattern of male leadership among God $
people: Though there are occasional examples of women having leadership
government positions such as queen (Athaliah did reign as sole monarch in 2
Kings 1:1-20_
but she is hardly an example t0 imitale
or judge (note
Deborah in Judg: 4-5), and though there were occasionally women such as
Deborah and Huldah who were prophetesses (see Judg: 4-5;
22.14-
20), we should note that these are rare exceptions in unusual circumstances
They occur in the midst of an
overwhelming pattern of male leadership
teaching and goverance, and, as such, they hardly serve as patterns for
Testament church office:
Moreover; there is not one example in the entire
Bible of a woman doing the kind of congregational Bible teaching that is
expected of pastors/elders in the New Testament church In the Old Testament
was the priests who had
responsibilities for the people; and the
priesthood was exclusively male; moreover; even the women prophets
Deborah and Huldah prophesied only privately, not publicly to
congregation
of people:
7. The History of the Church:
As was mentioned above_
the
overwhelming
pattern through the entire history of the church has been that the office of
pastorlelder (or its equivalent) has been reserved for men_
Although this does
demonstrate conclusively that such
position
correct,
should give uS
reason
reflect very seriously on the question before
rush ahead and
declare that almost the entire church throughout its history has been wrong on
this issue.
8. Objections_
Numerous objections have been brought against the position
outlined here, only
few of which can be treated at this point:
It is objected
that ministry should be determined by gifts, not by gender: But in response_
must be said that
spiritual gifts have to be used within the
guidelines given in
Scripture _
The Holy Spirit who empowers spiritual gifts is also the Holy Spirit
who inspired the Bible
and he does not want US
use his gifts in
disobedience t0 his words:
Another objection
say that if God has genuinely called
vumuI
to be
pastor; she should not be prevented from acting as
one:
The response
this objection
similar tO the one given
above: an individual claim t0 have experienced
call from God
must always be tested by subjecting
to the words of God in
Scripture. If the Bible teaches that God wills for men alone to bear
the primary teaching and governing responsibilities of the pastorate,
Kings
New
teaching
not
we
then by implication the Bible also teaches that God does not call
women t0 be pastors. However; we should add that often what
woman discerns as
divine call t0 the pastorate may be indeed
call to full-time Christian ministry, but nOt to be
pastor/elder in a
church
In fact;, many opportunities for full-time occupational
ministry exist within the local church and elsewhere; apart from
pastor or an elder
-for example_
church staff
positions in counseling;
women' $ ministries, Christian education;
and children
ministries_
as well as ministries of music and
worship, campus student ministries
evangelistic ministries,
ministries
the pOOr; and administrative responsibilities that do not
involve functioning in the elder 's role of government over the entire
church:
This list could be expanded_
but the point is that we
should not make restrictions where Scripture itself does not place
restrictions_
but should allow and encourage full and free
participation by women as well as men in all of these other areas
Some object that the New Testament emphasis is on servant
leadership, and therefore that we should not be s0 concerned about
authority; since that is more
pagan than
Christian concern
But
this objection makes
false distinction between servanthood and
authority. Certainly Jesus himself is the model of
servant
leader;
but Jesus also has authority
~great authority! He is the Lord of 0ur
lives and the Lord of the church By
elders ought to follow
Jesus' example of servant leadership (see
Peter 5.1-5) but that
does not mean that they should neglect t0 govern with authority
when the Bible itself gives them this responsibility (see
Tim.
5.17; Heb: 13.17;
Peter 5.5).
Sometimes people object that; just as the church finally realized
that slavery was wrong, SO the church today should recognize that
male leadership
wrong, and is an outdated cultural tradition that
should be discarded_
But this objection fails t0 realize the difference
between the temporary culturab
institution of slavery; which God
certainly did not establish at creation, and the existence of
difference
male-female roles in marriage (and, by implication_
relationships within the church) which God established at creation_
The seeds for the destruction of slavery were sown in the New
Testament (see Philem. 16; Eph: 6.9; Col. 41;
Tim. 6.1-2), but no
seeds for the destruction of marriage, Or the destruction of male
female differences as created, are sown in the Bible: Moreover; the
being
teaching
analogy;
objection can be turned around: it is likely that
closer parallel to
the Christian defenders of slavery in the nineteenth century is found
evangelical feminists who today use arguments from the Bible to
justify conformity tO some extremely strong pressures in
contemporary society (in favor of slavery then, and women being
pastors nOw)
It is sometimes objected that Priscilla and Aquila together
Apollos and
expounded to him the way of God more accurately"
(Acts 18.26). This is true, and it is helpful evidence showing that
informal discussion of Scripture by men and women together; in
which both men and women play
significant role in helping one
another understand Scripture, is approved by the New Testament.
Once again, an example such as this cautions US not to prohibit
activities which are not prohibited by Scripture, yet
does nOr
overtum the principle that the publicly recognized governing and
reaching role within
church is restricted t0 men. Priscilla was not
doing anything contrary t0 this restriction:
Sometimes it is objected that it
inconsistent to allow women [0
vOle
churches that have congregational government; but not
serve aS elders
But the authority of the church as
whole is nor the
same as the authority given to specific individuals within the
church
When we say that the
congregation as
whole has
authority; we d nOt mean that each man and each woman in the
congregation has the authority tO speak or act for the
congregation.
Therefore, gender; as
of individual
personhood
is not
significantly in view in corporate congregational decisions
Another way of
putting this is to say that the only question we are
asking in this section is whether women can be officers within the
church_
and specifically whether they can be elders within the
church: In any
congregational system where the elders are elected
by the congregation, it is evident t0 everyone in the church that the
elders have
kind of delegated authority which other members of
the congregation do not have
even though the other members of
the
congregation have voted for these people in the first place. It is
the same in all systems of government where officials are elected:
once the President of the United States O1 the mayor of
city is
elected, that person has
delegated authority over the people who
elected him or her and it is an authority that is greater than the
authority of any individual person who voted:
spoke
pan
At this point it is also appropriate
recognize that God has given
much insight and wisdom tO women as well as t0 men; and that any
church leaders who neglect to draw on the wisdom that women
have are really acting foolishly: Therefore_
any group of elders 01
other male leaders who make decisions affecting the entire church
should frequently have procedures within the church whereby the
wisdom and insight of other members of the church; especially the
wisdom and insight of women as well as men, can be drawn upon
as an aid in making decisions_
What About Other Offices Within the Church? The entire discussion
above has focused on the question of whether women should function as
pastors 0r elders within the church But what about other offices?
The biblical teaching regarding the office of deacon is much less
extensive than that regarding the office of elder;
and what is
involved in the office of deacon varies considerably from church t0
church: If deacons are actually
functioning
as elders and have the
highest governing authority within
local church, then the
arguments given above against women being elders would apply
directly to this situation
and it would follow that Scripture does not
permit women t0 be deacons in this sense_
On the other hand, if
deacons simply have delegated administrative responsibility for
certain aspects 0f the ministry of the church;, then there seems t0 be
reason t0 prevent women from
functioning
as deacons.
Regarding the question of women as deacons in
Timothy 3.8-13,
does not seem to the present author that this passage allows
women to be deacons in the way deacons are understood in that
situation, but there
significant difference of viewpoint among
evangelicals over the understanding of this passage
and it is
much less clear t0 US exactly what deacons did at that time than it is
clear what elders did_
With
regard
other offices, such as treasurer; for example
0r other
staff positions such as youth minister or
counseling director or
children
minister; and so forth; the only question to be asked is
whether these offices include the ruling and
functions
reserved for elders in the New Testament: If not; then all of these
offices would be open
women aS well as t0 men
for we must be
careful not t0
prohibit what the New Testament does not prohibit
good
teaching `
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
No matter what kind of church government structure YOu currently find
in, are there ways in which you could be more encouraging and
supportive t0 the current leaders in your church?
If you are currently an officer in your church; or if yOu someday would
[0 be one
is yOur pattern of life such that you would
[0 see
imitated by others in the church? If you have had
part in the process of
selecting church leaders
have You tended t0 emphasize the character
traits and spiritual qualifications talked about in Scripture
or have you
emphasized other qualifications that the world would look for in
selecting its leaders?
Do you think that the current governing structure of your church works
quite well? How could it be improved, without changing the basic
philosophy of church goverment tO which it is committed? Whether or
not your church has officers who are called
elders,
who are the people
who carry out the functions of elders in your church? Do you know if
your own pastor would like
see some modifications in the government
of your church; to enable him to carry out his task more effectively?
Before
this chapter; what was YOur view on the question of
women
serving
teaching pastors or elders in
church? How has this
chapter changed your view; if at all? Why do you think people
emotions are often very strong concering this issue? Can you explain
how you personally feel (emotionally) about the teaching presented in
this chapter? Does
seem right [0 You, or not?

"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken"
There are not many hymns

have put here
hymn which thanks God for the
blessings of being
member of God's people in general, and
therefore
citizen
the heavenly Mount Zion, the heavenly city
where God $ people dwell:
But in the hymn the author also uses
Old Testament imagery from the journey of God $ people through
the wilderness
see the cloud and fire appear;
v 3) , and the entire
hymn can also be seen as one of thanks to God for the
dwelling (spiritually) within the walls of the church today:
The author; John Newton, is also the author of the well-known
hymn "Amazing Grace
Glorious
things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God;
He whose Word cannor be broken formed thee for his own abode:
On the Rock of Ages founded, what can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation'$ walls surounded, thou may'st smile at all thy foes_

waters, springing from eternal

Chapter 48
Means of Grace Within the Church
What are the different activities within the life of the church that
God uses
bring blessing
us? What do we miss if we neglect
involvement in
local church?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
How Many
Means
Grace
Are Available
Us?
All of the blessings we experience in this life are ultimately
undeserved
they are all of grace: In fact; for Peter; the entire
Christian life is lived by grace (1 Peter 5.12).
But are there any special means that God uses t0 give additional
grace to us? Specifically; within the fellowship of the church are
there certain means
that is;
certain activities, ceremonies
functions
that God uses tO give more grace t0 us? Another way of
formulating that question is t0 ask whether there are certain means
through which the Holy Spirit works tO convey
into the
life of the believer: Of course, personal prayer; worship, and Bible
study; and personal faith, are all means through which God works

there is also
difference in fundamental meaning:

Protestant view; the means of grace are simply means of

Catholics teach that the means of grace

while Protestants hold that God only imparts grace when

'power of God for salvation'
(Rom:

1.16) and that the
preaching of Christ
'the power of God and the wisdom of
God" (1 Cor: 1.24). God caused us to be bom again or "brought
forth by
the word of truth"
(James 1.18) and Peter says
You have been born anew,
not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and
word of God" (1 Peter 1.23). It is the written Word of God_
the Bible; that is
able [0 instruct YOu fOr salvation through faith in Christ Jesus
(2 Tim
3.15).
Moreover; once we have become Christians, Paul reminds us that it
is the Word of God that is

is the Word of God that convicts US of sin and turns US [0

even

despair; because Paul says that it was written "that by steadfastness
and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope

speaking

author of Hebrews says, "the word of God
living and active, sharper than
any DYO-
edged sword, piercing t0 the division
soul and spirit, of joints and
marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart" (Heb. 4:12).
So closely are the growth and strength of the church linked t0 the
reign of the Word of God in people' s lives that more than once the
book of Acts
describe the growth of the church as the growth of
the Word of God: "And the word of God increased; and the number
of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem" (Acts 6.7); "But
the word of God grew and multiplied" (Acts 12.24);
And the word
of the Lord spread throughout all the region" (Acts 13.49).
So important is the Bible as the primary means of grace that God
gives to his people that Charles Hodge reminds Us that throughout
history true Christianity has flourished
just in proportion to the
degree in which the Bible is known; and its truths are diffused
among the people:
Moreover; he notes that there
no evidences
of salvation or sanctification t0 be found where the Word of God is
not known "The nations where the Bible
unknown sit in
darkness.
It is appropriate that we list the teaching of the Word as the first and
most important means of grace within the church
But we should
add that such teaching includes not only officially recognized
teaching by ordained clergy in the church; but also all the
teaching
that occurs in Bible studies, Sunday School classes_
Christian books on Scripture; and even in personal Bible study:
2. Baptism: Since Jesus commanded his church to baptize (Matt: 28.19), we
would expect that there would be
measure of blessing connected with
Ore
reading
baptism, because all obedience to God by Christians
God $ favor with
it. This obedience is specifically
public act of confessing Jesus as Savior; an
act which in itself -
joy and blessing to
believer: Moreover; it is a sign
of the believer's death and resurection with Christ (see Rom 6.2-5; Col:
2.12), and it seems
that the
Spirit would work through such
sign
increase our faith; t0 increase OUI experiential
realization of death t0 the
power and love of sin in our lives, and to increase Our experience of the
power of new resurection life in Christ that we have as believers. Since
baptism is
physical symbol of the death and resurrection of Christ and our
participation in them, it should also give additional assurance of union with
Christ to all believers who are present: Finally, since water baptism is an
outward symbol of inward spiritual baptism by the Holy Spirit; we may
expect that the Holy Spirit
ordinarily work alongside the baptism, giving
t0 believers an
increasing realization of the benefits of the spiritual baptism [0
which it points
When baptism
closely accompanies someone
initial
profession of faith and is in fact the outward form that profession of
faith takes_
there is certainly
connection between baptism and
receiving the gift of the
Spirit; for Peter says t0 his hearers at
Pentecost;
Repent, and be baptized every one of YOu in the name
of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2.38). Moreover; Paul
says,
You were buried with him in baptism;
which you were
also raised with him through faith in the
of God, who
raised him from the dead" (Col. 2.12). The statement that it is
"through faith in the working of God" that this happens reminds us
that there is no magical property in the act of baptism itself, which
causes
spiritual result to come about; yet the verse also indicates
that when faith accompanies baptism there is genuine spiritual work
the life of the person being baptized_
As we would expect;
sometimes great spiritual joy follows upon baptism
great joy in
the Lord and in the salvation that baptism s0 vividly pictures (see
Acts 8.39; 16.34).
Although we must avoid the Roman Catholic
that grace IS
imparted even apart from the faith of the person
baptized, we
must not react S0 strongly [0 this eror that we say that there is no
spiritual benefit at all that comes from baptism, that the
Spirit
does not work through it and that
is merely symbolic: It is better
LO say that where there is genuine faith on the part of the person

through which the Holy Spirit brings blessing tO
the person being baptized and to the church as well. (Baptism will
be more fully discussed in the next chapter:)
3. The Lord' $
In addition t0 baptism; the other ordinance or
ceremony that Jesus commanded the church t0 canry out is participation in the
Lord's Supper: Although this subject will be discussed more thoroughly in
chapter 50,it is appropriate t0 note here that participation in the Lord $
Supper is also very clearly
means of grace which the Holy Spirit uses t0
bring
to the church: The Lord'
Supper is not simply an ordinary
meal among human beings
it is a fellowship with Christ, in his presence and
at his table
Once
we must avoid the idea that any automatic O1 magical
benefit comes from sharing in the Lord $ Supper; whether
person
participates in faith or not:
But when
person participates in faith,
renewing and strengthening his or her Own trust in Christ for
salvation, and believing that the Holy Spirit will bring spiritual
blessing through such participation
then
certainly additional
blessing may be expected: We must be careful here, as with
baptism; to avoid the mistake of overreacting to Roman Catholic
reaching and maintaining that the Lord $
is merely symbolic
and not
means of grace
Paul says, "The cup of blessing which we
bless,
ic nor
participation (Gk koinonia, "sharing_
"fellowship
in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break; is
iL noL
participation [koinonia] in the body of Christ?" (1 Cor:
10:16). Because there is such
sharing in the
and blood of
Christ (apparently meaning
sharing in the benefits of Christ'$
body and blood given for us
the unity of believers is beautifully
exhibited at the time of the Lord s Supper: "Because there is one
bread, we who are many are
une
body; for we all partake of the one
bread" (1 Cor: 10.17). And since
we are
participants at "the table of
the Lord"
Cor: 10.21), Paul warns the Corinthians that they
cannot participate in the Lord s table and also participate in idol
worship:
You cannot partake in the table of the Lord and the table
of demons'
Cor: 10.21). There is
spiritual union among
believers and with the Lord that is strengthened and solidified at the
Lord's Supper; and it is not to be taken lightly:
This is why the Corinthians were experiencing judgment for their

and some have died"
But if Paul says there will be judgment for
wrong participation in the Lord's Supper; then certainly we should
expect blessing for right participation in the Lord $

(John 6.55-56; cf:
52-54,57-58; also VV: 27,33-35.
48-51).
As with baptism; therefore_
should expect that the Lord would
give spiritual blessing as we participate in the Lord's Supper in
faith and in obedience to the directions laid down in Scripture_
and
in this way it is
'means of grace
which the Holy Spirit uses t0
convey
blessing
Prayer: We have already studied prayer in chapter 18, S0 we need only note
here that corporate prayer within the church as it assembles, and prayer by
church members for one another; are
means which the Holy Spirit
uses daily to bring blessing to Christians within the church. Certainly we are
pray together as well as individually, following the example of the early
church:
When they heard the threats of the Jewish leaders,
"they lifted their
voices together to God" in prayer (Acts 4.24-30),
And when they had
prayed, the place in which
were
together
Was
shaken; and
were all filled with the Holy Spirit and
the word of God with boldness'
(Acts 4.31; cf. 2.42). When Peter was put in prison,
earnest prayer for him
was made to God by the church" (Acts 12.5).
If prayer from the church is not simply the mouthing of words
without heartfelt intention, but is the genuine expression of our
hearts and the reflection of sincere faith, then we should expect that
the Holy Spirit will

when prayer is done "in the Spirit" (Eph: 6.18; cf. Jude 20: "pray in
the Holy Spirit"
it involves fellowship with the
Spirit and

The more the genuine fellowship of
church increases, the more
there ought to be continual prayer for one another within the
church; and the more genuine spiritual
from the Holy
Spirit may be expected to flow through the church
Worship_
Genuine worship is worship "in spirit" (John 4.23-24; Phil. 3.3),
which probably means worship that is in the spiritual realm of activity (not
merely the outward physical action of attendance at
worship service or
songs)
When we enter that spiritual realm of activity and minister
to the Lord in worship, God also ministers t0 US . So, for example; in the
church at Antioch; ir was
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting
that "the Holy Spirit said,
Set apart for me Bamabas and Saul for the work t0
which
have called them'
(Acts 13.2). This parallels the experience of the
people of Israel
the Old Testament who knew the presence of God when
they engaged in genuine worship:
When the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other
musical
instruments
praise t0 the LORD, "For he is good, for his
steadfast love endures forever;
the house, the house of the LORD was
filled with
cloud_
that the priests could not stand t0 minister
because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
Chron. 5.13-14).
When God'$ people worshiped, he came in
very visible way to dwell in their
midst_ Similarly in the New Testament; James promises; "Draw near t0 God
and he will draw near
you
(James 4.8).
as God'$ people worshiped, he delivered them from their
enemies (2 Chron: 20.18-23), or at other times gave them true
spiritual insight into the nature of events around them (Ps. 73.17:
"Until
went into the sanctuary of God; then
perceived their
end"
If worship is genuinely an experience of
near t0 God
coming into his presence_
and
giving him the praise he deserves_
then we certainly ought
count
one of the primary
means of
grace'
available
the church. Through genuine congregational
worship God will very often bring great

and corporately; t0 his people_

6. Church Discipline:
Because church discipline is
means by which the
purity of the church is advanced and holiness of life is encouraged,
certainly should count
'means of grace'
as well. However; blessing is
automatically given: when the church disciplines, no spiritual good comes
the wrongdoer unless the Holy Spirit convicts him or her of sin and
about
godly grief" that
produces
repentance that leads t0 salvation and
regret" (2 Cor: 7:10), and no spiritual good comes to the church
unless the Holy Spirit is active in the other members' lives when
become
aware of the process. This is why the church is tO carry out discipline with the
knowledge that it is done in the presence of the Lord
Cor: 5.4; cf: 419-20),
and with the assurance that it has heavenly sanction connected with it (Matt:
16.19; 18.18-20).
would be very healthy for the church to
begin tO think of church
discipline not as an onerous burden placed upon it by the Lord, but
genuine
means of grace
by which great blessing can come to
the church
reconciling believers to one another and to God, in
restoring the erring brother or sister tO walk in obedience; in
waming all to "stand
fear"
Tim. 5.20), in increasing moral
purity
the church; and
protecting and advancing Christ'$
honor: Though sorrow and pain are often connected with church
discipline_
when it is rightly done, with faith that the Lord is
working through it; the sorrow will "bring no
(2 Cor: 7.10).
When carried out in this way; church discipline should certainly be
seen as
means of grace by which the
Spirit will bring
blessing to his church
ordinarily done through the church as
receives and
distributes gifts t0 the various ministries and needs cared for by the church:
Once again; there is no automatic or mechanical bestowing of benefits on
those who give: Simon the sorcerer was strongly rebuked for thinking that he
could obtain the gift of God with money" (Acts 8.20).
But if giving is done
in faith, out of commitment t0 Christ and love for his people, then certainly
there will be great
in it. It is mOSt
pleasing to God when gifts of
money are accompanied by an intensification of the giver =

commitment t0 God_
as was the case among the Macedonians who "first

Paul views the giving of money t0 the Lord $ work as spiritual
sowing that will lead t0
harvest: "he who sows sparingly will also
reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully will also reap
bountifully" (2 Cor: 9.6). And Paul expects that as the Corinthians
give rightly God will bless them:
And God is able t0 make all
grace abound
YOu, that always having all sufficiency
everything
you may have an abundance for every good deed" (2
Cor: 9.8 NASB) He tells them; "You will be enriched in every way
for great generosity; which through us will produce thanksgiving
God" (2 Cor: 9:11). Therefore giving blesses the recipient in that his
her needs are met and faith and
thanksgiving for God's provision
are increased;
blesses the giver because "God loves
cheerful
giver" and will
an abundant spiritual harvest; and brings
blessing to all who know about
since
produces
haivest of
"many thanksgivings to God" (2 Cor: 9.12). Rather than seeing
giving as an unpleasant
obligation,
would do well t0 view it as
rich means of
grace within the church, and
expect that through it
the Holy Spirit will bring blessing:
8. Spiritual Gifts. Peter views spiritual gifts as channels through which God s
grace comes [0 the church because he says_
As each has received
gift,
employ it for one another; as good stewards of God $ varied grace
Peter
4.10). When gifts are used for one another in the church, God'$ grace is
thereby dispensed [O those fOr whom God intended

come t0 the church
through proper use of spiritual gifts, as the church follows
Paul $ command [0 use the
t0 "strive t0 excel in
up the church"
Cor: 14.12; cf. Eph: 411-16).
If we listed all the spiritual gifts as separate means of grace, our list
of the means of grace would be much longer than eleven items.
But
evem
if we contain them all in this one category; we should
recognize that the different spiritual
in the church are all
means by which the Holy Spirit
blessing through individual
Christians- This should remind uS of the abundant favor that God
has given uS as undeserving sinners; and should also make US
realize that many different Christians_
with diverse gifts_
can be the
channels through which grace comes
In fact; in Peter' $
exhortation [0 use
spiritual gifts as stewards of "God's varied
grace'
(1 Peter 4.10), the word translated
varied" (Gk poikilos)
means
~having many facets or aspects; richly varied; having great

all believers who have the Holy Spirit within them (1 Cor: 12.7,

Peter 4.10).
9. Fellowship_
We should not neglect ordinary Christian fellowship as
valuable means of grace within the church: The early church "devoted
themselves
the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread
and the prayers
(Acts 2.42).
And the author of Hebrews reminds believers_
"Let uS consider how t0 stir Up one another t0 love and good works, not
neglecting
meet
together; as is the habit of some
but encouraging one
another; and all the more as YOu see the
drawing near " (Heb_
10.24-25).
In the fellowship of believers, ordinary friendship and affection for one
another will grow, and Jesus' injunction that we "love one
another" (John
15.12) will be fulfilled_
Moreover; as believers care for one another; they will
Bear one another $ burdens
and so fulfil the law of Christ" (Gal. 6.2).
An emphasis on the fellowship of believers with one another as
means of grace would also help to overcome an excessive focus on
the ordained
the primary dispensers of grace within the
church; and particularly when the church as
whole is assembled
It would also be healthy for Christians t0 recognize that
measure
of God $ grace
experienced when Christians talk together and eat
together; when they have times of work and play
together; enjoying
one another's fellowship. "And day by day; attending the temple
together and breaking bread
their homes
they partook of food
with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with
all the people" (Acts 2.46-47)
10. Evangelism: In Acts, there is
trequent connection between proclaiming
the gospel (even in the face of opposition) and
filled with the Holy
Spirit (see Acts 2.4 with vv: 14-36; 48,31; 9:17 with
20; 13.9,52).
Evangelism is
means of grace; then, not only in the sense that it ministers
saving grace t0 the unsaved, but also because those who
evangelize
experience more of the Holy Spirit $ presence and
in theit Own lives_
Sometimes evangelism is carried out by individuals, but at other times it is
corporate activily of the church (as in evangelistic campaigns)
And even
individual evangelism often involves other church members who will
welcome an
unbelieving visitor and give attention to his or her needs. So
evangelism is rightly considered
means of grace in the church
Personal Ministry t0 Individuals
with the previous ten
means of
grace
within the church; it is appropriate tO list one more specific means that
the Holy Spirit very frequently uses to bring blessing to individual
Christians
Day
clergy
being

Along-
This means of grace operates when one Or more Christians within the church
take time to minister; in various ways,
very specific needs of another
individual in the church:
Sometimes this ministry takes the form of words of encouragement
exhortation or wise counsel. We are t0 "teach and admonish one
another in all wisdom" (Col. 3.16), and to speak words that "impart
grace to those who hear" (Eph: 4.29)
We are tO attempt to
bring
back
sinner from the erTor of his way
(James 5.20) and tO
consider how t0 stir Up one another t0 love and
works'
and
encouraging one another" (Heb_
10.24-25).
At other times
such ministry involves giving t0 assist the material needs of =
brother or sister: James rebukes those who merely say; "Go in
peace; be warmed and filled,
without "giving them the things
needed for the body" (James 2.16). John warns uS_
"If any one has
the world's goods and sees his brother in need
yet closes his heart
against him; how does God's love abide in him?"
John 3.17).
Therefore the early church gave readily to the needs of poor
Christians, SO that
There was not a needy person among them"
(Acts 4.34). And Paul said that the leaders of the church in
Jerusalem
would have uS remember the poor; which
thing
Was
eager t0 do" (Gal. 2:10)-
Another form this interpersonal ministry may take is the anointing
with oil in conjunction with prayer for
sick person. Jesus'
disciples
anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them'
(Mark 6.13). Similarly, James says that
sick person should
call
for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him; anointing
him with oil in the name of the Lord" (James 5.14). In these cases
the oil seems t0 have been
physical symbol of the
power
of the Holy Spirit coming to the sick person.
Finally; one more means of
exercising personal ministry
individuals in the New Testament is the use of physical touch;
particularly the laying on of hands in connection with prayer for
someone in need.
A survey of the New Testament may bring
surprise t0 many modern Christians (as it did t0 the present author)
when they see how frequently the laying on of hands and other
kinds of physica_
touch are seen t0 function as
'means of
in the ministry of Jesus and the early church:
seems that the laying on of hands was by far the most
common
good
vely
healing
grace"
method that Jesus used tO pray for people:
When crowds came
bringing people
with various diseases" t0 him; "he laid his hands
on every one of them and healed them" (Luke 4.40). Other passages
specifically describe Jesus' placing his hands on people to heal
them (Matt: 8.3
Mark 1.41; 6.5; 8.23-25; Luke 5.13; 13.13). But
[OIE
significant than these individual
passages is the fact that
people who came
Jesus for
would come specifically
him t0 lay his hands on
sick person:
Come and
vour
hand on her; and she will live
(Matt. 9:18), 0r "Come and
your
hands on her; s0 that she may be made well, and live
(Mark 5.23;
cf: 7.32).
The fact that people came with this request suggests that
the laying on of hands was commonly
recognized as the method
Jesus usually used t0 heal people_
In imitation of Jesus
method ot
when the father of Publius was sick;
Paul visited him and
prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him" (Acts 28.8).
In other cases people sought more generally tO touch Jesus_
asked that he would touch them; in order t0 be healed:
And some
people brought t0 him
blind man, and begged him to touch him"
(Mark 8.22). Similarly; people "brought to him all that were sick;
and besought him that
might only touch the
of his
garment; and as many
touched it were made well" (Matt. 14.35-
36). This was because the power of the
Spirit was conveyed
through Jesus' physical
touch; and came forth and healed people:
"All the crowd sought tO touch him; for power came forth from him
and healed them all" (Luke 6.19; cf: Matt. 9.20-22, 25; 20.34;
Mark 1.31; 5.41; 9.27; Luke 7.14; 8.51; 22.51).
However; it was not simply to heal that Jesus and the early church
laid on hands Or [ouched people_
When children came t0 Jesus
took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon
them'
(Mark 10.16; cf. Matt: 19.13-15; Luke 18.15).
When Jesus s0 frequently [ouched people t0 bring healing or
otherwise to bring blessing to them; it is not surprising that people
would mention the miracles done by his hands: "What mighty
works (Gk dynamis,
"miracle
are wrought by his hands! '
(Mark
6.2)_
Similarly; when Paul and Barnabas were on their first
missionary journey; the Lord "bore witness tO the word of his grace;
granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (Acts
14.3).
In the same way; "God did extraordinary miracles by the
healing`
asking
Iay -
Iay =
healing:
they
fringe
Holy
The
hands of Paul" (Acts 19.11)
Since there was_
as with the other
means of grace; no automatic O magical power inherent in the
hands of the early Christians; but
and other kinds of
blessing only came as God himself was pleased to work through the
laying on of hands, it is nOt surprising that the early church prayed
specifically that God would stretch forth his hand to heal. They
prayed,
And now; Lord, look upon their threats_
and grant tO your
servants t0 speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch Out
your hand
heal" (Acts 4.29-30). They realized that while they
stretched forth their hands t0 touch those who were sick ir would
not be effective at all unless God $ Own mighty hand of power was
working through their hands_
At other times the laying on of hands was done for some other
purpose. Apparently it was done in connection with
God t0
empower Or
equip people for some service or ministry: When the
first deacons were appointed, the church brought them before the
apostles;
and they prayed and laid their hands upon them
(Acts
6.6).
Similarly; when the church at Antioch sent out Paul and
Barnabas; "When they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands
them,
sent them away
(Acts 13.3 NASB)
When the gospeL
came [0
Mer
group of people
those who
proclaimed the gospel would sometimes lay hands on the new
believers in order that
might receive the new covenant power
of the Holy Spirit At Samaria
the apostles "laid their hands on
them and they received the
Spirit" (Acts 8.17). Ananias laid
his hands on Saul in order that he might regain his sight and "be
filled with the
Spirit" (Acts 9.17). When Paul "laid his hands
upon'
the disciples at Ephesus who had just come (0 believe in
Jesus, "the Holy Spirit came on them'
(Acts 19.6).
In other cases the
laying on of hands resulted in the impartation of
SUME
spiritual gift. In the incident just mentioned_
the disciples at
Ephesus also
spoke with tongues and prophesied" (Acts 19.6) after
Paul laid his hands on them:
Moreover; he reminds Timothy; "Do
not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophetic
utterance (literally; "through prophecy'
when the council of elders
laid their hands upon you"
Tim: 4.14)
Paul may have been
referring
t0 the same event Or
different one when he said
remind yOu to rekindle the gift of God that
within you through
the laying on of my hands
(2 Tim_
1.6). (In
Timothy 5.22

statement

If people in the early church were frequently praying for one
another'
needs_
and if they imitated the example of Jesus and his
disciples in the laying on of hands to pray for people for healing_
for bringing blessing: for receiving the Holy Spirit at the time of
conversion, for receiving spiritual gifts, or for empowering for
ministry; then we would expect that instruction given to new
Christians would have included the teaching that prayer for
individual
needs would ordinarily be accompanied by the placing of
hand or hands upon the person who was
prayed for: If this
were SO, then
would not be surprising that "the laying on of
hands" would be classified as an "elementary" doctrine, something
that
belongs to the "foundation'
of Christian instruction
which is
fact what we find in Hebrews 6.1-2. Although some have
understood this [0 refer
narrowly t0 the laying on of hands
that accompanies installation in some specific church office
that is
only one small aspect of the pattern of situations in which
of hands is found in the New Testament It seems much better t0
understand this phrase in Hebrews 6.2 to refer t0 elementary
instruction about how tO pray for others in various situations of
need s0 that young Christians would immediately be able to begin
ministering tO Others as well
It seems
appropriate, then; to count the laying on of hands as one
other dimension of the rich diversity of
means of
that God
has placed within the church to bring blessing to his people
Should
Footwashing Be Practiced As
Means of Grace Within the
Church? From time tO time some Christian groups have practiced
ceremony of washing one another's feet at
public meeting of the church:
They have based this practice 0n Jesus '$ command, "If
then, your Lord and
Teacher; have washed your
YOu also ought I0 wash one another
(John 13.14). Those who advocate footwashing consider it
ceremony that
Jesus commanded_
similar to the ceremonies of baptism and the Lord $
Supper:
However; there are several reasons why we should not think that in
John 13.14 Jesus was
establishing
another ceremony for the church
in addition to baptism and the Lord's Supper:
Baptism and the
Lord $
Supper explicitly symbolize the greatest event in the history
being
mare
laying
grace'
fecl;
feet"
of redemption, Christ'$ death and resurection for uS_
but
foorwashing symbolizes no such redemptive-historical event
Baptism and the Lord' $
were clearly
symbolic actions, but
when Jesus washed the disciples
feet it was clearly functional, not
merely symbolic; in that it met an ordinary human need of the day
(dirty feet). (3) Baptism and the Lord s Supper are appropriate
symbols of beginning and continuing in the Christian life,
but no
such symbolism attaches t0 footwashing:
To make footwashing
ordinance like baptism and the Lord $
reduces
symbol
-and if it is
symbol, then Jesus
words command us only
perform
symbol; and the real force of Jesus' command (t0 act
humility and love) is lost:
Whereas the epistles give evidence
that baptism and the Lord'$ Supper were continuing ordinances
observed by the New Testament churches_
there is no evidence thar
the apostles or the early church observed footwashing as an
ordinance.
(6) There is
simple and
straightforward explanation for
Jesus' command: he is telling his disciples t0 take lowly tasks in
one
another: But if this is what the text means
the vast
majority of the church through history has understood
this way),
then we need not look for an additional meaning (that Jesus is also
instituting
new ceremony). By contrast; the New Testament texts
about baptism and the Lord $ Supper cannot be understood
command
something other than
ceremony.
Therefore
while all
Christians would profit from pondering the application of Jesus
statement about footwashing t0 their present patterns of life, none
should think that Jesus is encouraging them to practice
ceremony
footwashing:
Conclusions
At the end of this discussion of the means of grace within the
church; we should realize first of all that when any of these are
canied out in faith and obedience
we should eagerly expect and
look for evidence that the Holy Spirit is actually ministering tO
people at the same time as these actions are being done
We as
Christians ought not t0 neglect [0
meet
(Heb. 10.25), but
ought to look forward
eagerly to any assembly of believers in
which any of these means would occur;
expecting that God will
bring blessing from each of these means!
On the other hand_
we muSt realize that all of these means of grace
occur within the fellowship of the church: Those who neglect the
Supper
Supper
serving
(and
together'
fellowship of the church willfully cut themselves off from all of
these means of grace and thereby cut themselves off from most of
the ordinary means that the
Spirit uses to bring blessing to his
people:
These means of grace ought [0 give US
appreciation for the
amazing privilege of being members of the body of Christ, the
church:

Baptism
Who should be baptized? How should it be done? What does it
mean?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In this chapter and the next we treat baptism and the Lord' $
Supper;
IWO ceremonies that Jesus commanded his church t0 perfom_
But
before we begin consideration of either one of them we must note
that there is disagreement among Protestants even over the general
term that should be applied t0 them: Because the Roman Catholic
Church calls these [Wo ceremonies
sacraments_
and because the
Catholic Church teaches that these sacraments in themselves
actually convey grace
people (without requiring faith from the
persons participating
them), some Protestants
especially
Baptists) have refused to refer to baptism and the Lord's Supper as
sacraments.
They have preferred the word ordinances instead
This is thought to be an appropriate term because baptism and the
Lord'$ Supper Were
ordained" by Christ:
On the other hand, other
Protestants such as those in the Anglican;
Lutheran, and Reformed
traditions, have been
t0 use the word
sacraments
to refer
to baptism and the Lord s Supper; without thereby
endorsing the
Roman Catholic position:
does not seem that any
significant point is at issue here in the
question of whether tO call baptism and the Lord'$ Supper
ordinances'
sacraments.
Since Protestants who use both
words explain clearly what they mean by them; the argument is not
really over doctrine but over the
of an English word_
If we
are
to explain clearly what we mean, it does not seem tO
make any difference whether we
the word sacrament 0r not:
this text; when referring to baptism and the Lord $ Supper in
Protestant teaching;
will use both
ordinances'
and
sacraments"
interchangeably; and
them as synonymous in meaning
willing -
meaning
willing -
regard
Before
beginning our discussion of baptism we must
recognize that
there has been historically, and is today;
strong difference of
viewpoint among
evangelical Christians regarding this subject: The
position advocated in this book is that baptism is not
"major"
doctrine that should be the basis of division among genuine
Christians,
but it is nonetheless
matter of importance for ordinary
church life_
and it is appropriate that we give it full consideration_
The position advocated in this chapter is "Baptistic'
-namely; that
baptism is appropriately administered only to those who give
believable profession of faith in Jesus Christ: During the discussion;
shall interact particularly with the paedobaptist
infant baptist" -
position as advocated by Louis Berkhof in his Systematic Theology;
since this is
careful and responsible representation of the
paedobaptist position; and it is in
widely used systematic theology
text:
The Mode and Mraning of Eaptism
The practice of baptism in the New Testament was carried out in
one way: the person being baptized was immersed Or put
completely under the water and then brought back up again.
Baptism by immersion is therefore the
mode
of baptism or the
way in which baptism was carried out in the New Testament: This
is evident for the following reasons:
(1) The Greek word baptizo means "tO
plunge, dip, immerse"
something
in water: This is the commonly
recognized and standard
meaning of the term
ancient Greek literature both inside and
outside of the Bible
(2) The sense "immerse
is appropriate and probably required for
the word in several New Testament passages. In Mark 1.5, people
were baptized by John "in the river Jordan'
(the Greek text has en,
"in,
and not "beside" or
by" or
near" the river)_
Mark also tells
us that when Jesus had been baptized "he came up out of the water
(Mark 1:10). The Greek text specifies that he came
out of" (ek) the
water; not that he came away trom
(this would be expressed by
Gk apo) The fact that John and Jesus went into the river and came
up out of it strongly suggests immersion
since
sprinkling or
pouring of water could much more readily have been done standing
beside the river; particularly because multitudes of people were
coming for baptism. John's gospel tells us, further; that John the
Baptist
was baptizing at Aenon near Salim; because there Was
much water there
(John 3.23). Again, it would not take
much
water" to baptize people by sprinkling; but it would take much
water tO baptize by immersion
When Philip had shared the gospel with the Ethiopian eunuch;
went along the road they
some water; and the eunuch
said, 'See_
here is water ! What is tO prevent my being baptized?
(Acts 8.36) . Apparently neither of them thought that sprinkling or
pouring
handful of water from the container of drinking water that
would have been carried in the chariot was enough t0 constitute
baptism Rather; they waited until there was
body of water near
the road. Then
he commanded the chariot t0 stop, and
both
went down into the water; Philip and the eunuch
and he baptized
him.
And when they came up OUt of the water; the Spirit of the Lord
caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his
way rejoicing'
(Acts 8.38-39). As in the case of Jesus, this baptism
occurred when Philip and the eunuch went down into
body of
water; and after the baptism they came up out of that body of water:
Once again baptism by immersion is the only satisfactory
explanation of this narrative_
The symbolism of union with Christ in his death; burial, and
resurrection seems t0 require baptism by immersion. Paul says,
Do you not know that all of uS who have been baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with
him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead
by the glory of the Father;
LOO might walk in newness of life
(Rom 6.3-4)
Similarly, Paul tells the Colossians
You were buried with him in baptism, in
which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God,
who raised him from the dead" (Col: 2.12).
Now this truth is clearly symbolized in baptism by immersion.
When the candidate for baptism goes down into the water it is
picture of going down into the grave and
buried:.
out of the water is then
picture of being raised with Christ to walk
ne MeSS
of lite_
Baptism thus very clearly pictures death
one
they
came
they
being
Coming '
old way of life and rising
new kind of life in Christ. But
baptism by sprinkling or pouring simply misses this symbolism_
Sometimes it is objected that the essential
symbolized in
baptism is not death and resurrection with Christ but purification
and cleansing from sins
Certainly
is true that water is an evident
symbol of
and
cleansing; and the waters of baptism do
symbolize washing and purification from sins aS well as death and
resurrection
Christ: Titus 3.5 speaks of
washing of
regeneration'
and, even
though the word baptism is not used in this
text, it is
certainly true that there is
cleansing from sin that occurs
at the time of conversion
Ananias told Saul, "Rise and be baptized_
and wash away your sins, calling on his name"
(Acts 22.16).
But to say that washing away of sins is the only
(or even the
most essential thing
pictured in baptism does not faithfully
represent New Testament teaching: Both washing and death and
resurrection with Christ are symbolized in baptism; but Romans
6.1-11 and Colossians 2.11-12 place
clear emphasis on dying and
rising with Christ. Even the washing is much more effectively
symbolized by immersion than by sprinkling or pouring
and death
and resurrection with Christ are symbolized only by immersion, nOt
at all by sprinkling Or pouring_
What then is the positive meaning of baptism? In all the discussion
over the mode of baptism and the disputes over its meaning;
easy for Christians to lose sight of the significance and beauty of
baptism and t0 disregard the tremendous blessing that accompanies
this ceremony: The
truuths of
passing through the waters of
judgment safely; of dying and rising with Christ; and of having our
sins washed away; are truths of momentous and eternal proportion
and ought to be an occasion for giving great glory and praise t0
God. If churches would teach these truths more clearly, baptisms
would be the occasion of much more blessing in the church:

The pattern revealed at several places in the New Testament is that
only those who give
believable profession of faith should be
baptized: This view
often called "believers
baptism;
since
holds that only those who have themselves believed in Christ (01;
more precisely; those who have given reasonable evidence of
thing
washing
with
"the
thing
amazing
believing
in Christ) should be baptized_
This is because baptism;
which is
symbol of
beginning the Christian life, should only be
given to those who have in fact begun the Christian life.
The
Argument From the New Testament Narrative Passages 0n
Baptism: The narrative examples of those who were baptized suggest that
baptism was administered only t0 those who
believable profession of
faith
After Peter $ sermon at Pentecost we read
Those who received his
word were baptized" (Acts 2.41)
The text specifies that baptism was
administered
those who "received his word" and therefore trusted in Christ
for salvation_
Similarly; when Philip preached the gospel in Samaria
read
When they believed Philip as he preached
news about the
kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they
baptized, both men
and women
(Acts 8.12). Likewise,
when Peter preached to the Gentiles in
Comelius' household
he allowed baptism for those who had heard the Word
and received the
Spirit
-that is, for those who had given persuasive
evidence of an internal work of regeneration.
While Peter was
preaching;
the
Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word" and Peter and his companions
"heard them speaking
tongues and
extolling God" (Acts 10.44-46) . Peter'$
response was that baptism is appropriate for those who have received the
regenerating work of the Holy Spirit: "Can any one forbid water for
baptizing
these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" Then Peter
commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ" (Acts 10.47 -
48). The point of these three passages is that baptism is appropriately given t0
those who have received the gospel
and trusted in Christ for salvation: There
are other texts that indicate this as well
Acts 16.14-15 (Lydia and her
household, after "the Lord opened her heart"
believe); Acts 16.32-33 (the
family of the Philippian jailer; after Peter preached "the word of the Lord to
him and t0 all that were in his house
and
Corinthians 1:16 (the household
of Stephanas) , but these
be discussed more fully below when we look at
the question of "household baptisms:
2. The
Argument From the Meaning of Baptism: In addition to these
indications from New Testament narratives that baptism always followed
upon saving faith; there is
second consideration that argues for believers'
baptism: the outward symbol of beginning the Christian life should only be
given
those who show evidence of having begun the Christian life. The
New 'lestament
authors wrote as though they clearly assumed that everyone
who was baptized had also personally trusted in Christ and experienced
salvation
For example, Paul says_
As many of you as were baptized into
Christ have
on Christ" (Gal. 3.27). Paul here assumes that baptism is the
outward sign of inward regeneration. This simply would not have been true of
Bave
good
wer
Holy
Will
pul
infants
Paul could not have said,
As many infants as have been baptized
into Christ have put on Christ;
for infants have not yet come
saving faith
given any evidence of regeneration.
Paul speaks the same
way in Romans 6.3-4: "Do YOu not know that
all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized
into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into
death:
Could Paul have said this of infants?
Could he have said
that
all infants who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were
baptized into his death" and "were buried therefore with him by
baptism into death; S0 that as Christ was raised from the dead"
But
if Paul could not have said those things about infants, then those
who advocate infant baptism must say that baptism means
something different for infants than what Paul says
means for
of uS who have been baptized into Christ Jesus_
Those who argue
for infant baptism
this point resort to what seems t0 the present
author to be vague
language about infants
adopted "into the
covenant" or
the covenant community;'
but the New
Testament does not speak that way about baptism
Rather; it says
that all of those who have been baptized have been buried with
Christ; have been raised with him, and have put on Christ:
A similar argument can be made from Colossians 2:12:
You were
buried with him in baptism; in which yOu were also raised with him
through faith in the
of God, who raised him from the
dead_
But it could not be said of infants that they were buried with
Christ; or were raised with him through faith, since
were nOL
yet old enough t0 exercise faith for themselves
3. Alternative #I: The Roman Catholic View: The Roman Catholic Church
teaches that baptism should be administered t0 infants
The reason for this is
that the Catholic Church believes that baptism
necessary for salvation, and
that the act of baptism itself causes regeneration. Therefore, in this view;
baptism is
means whereby the church bestows
grace on people
And
if ic is this kind of
channel of saving grace
should be given to all people:
Ludwig Ott, in his Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma
gives the
following explanations:
Baptism is that Sacrament in which man being washed with water in
the name of the Three Divine Persons
spiritually rebom: (p. 350; Ott
being

they

gives John 3.5; Titus 3.5; and Eph. 5.26 in support of this statement)
Baptism, provided that the proper dispositions (Faith and SOrTow for
sin) are present; effects: a) the eradication of sins_
both original sin and,
in the case of adults_
also personal, mortal or venial
b) inner
sanctification by the infusion of sanctifying grace: (p. 354)
Even if
be unworthily received, valid Baptism imprints 0n the soul of
the recipient an indelible spiritual mark, the Baptismal Character:
The baptized person is incorporated
by the Baptismal Character; into
the Mystical Body of Christ:
Every validly baptized person, even
one baptized outside the Catholic Church; becomes
member of the
One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church: (p. 355)
Ott goes on t0 explain that baptism is necessary for salvation and is
[O be
performed only by priests:
Baptism by water
is, since the promulgation of the Gospel,
necessary for all men without exception for salvation. (p_
356)
Ott explains that; while baptism is ordinarily to be administered by
priest; in unusual circumstances (such as when
child is
danger
dying soon after birth)
may be performed by
deacon 0r
layperson. Even baptism performed by unbelievers is thought to be
valid, for Ott says:
Yea_
even
pagan or
heretic can baptise, provided he adheres t0 the
form of the Church and has the intention of doing what the Church
does. (p. 358)
Though infants cannot exercise saving faith themselves, the Roman
Catholic Church teaches that the baptism of infants is valid:
Faith, as it is not the effective cause of justification
need not be
present: The faith which infants lack is
replaced by the faith of the
Church: (p. 359)
EssentiaE
understanding the Roman Catholic view of baptism is
the realization that Catholics hold that the sacraments work apart
from the faith of the people participating in the sacrament And if
this
SO, then it follows that baptism would confer grace even on
infants who do not have the ability t0 exercise faith: Several
stalements in Ott $ book make this clear:
sins;
The Catholic Church teaches that the Sacraments have an objective
efficacy; that is,
efficacy independent of the subjective disposition of
the recipient or of the minister:
The Sacraments confer grace
immediately; that is
without the mediation of Fiducial faith_
(pp. 328-
29)
The Sacraments of the New Covenant contain the grace which
signify, and bestow
on those who do nor hinder
(p: 328)
The Sacraments work ex opere operato.
That is_
the Sacraments
operate by the power of the completed sacramental rite. (p. 329)
The formula
ex opere operato
asserts, negatively that the
sacramental grace is not conferred by reason of the subjective activity
of the recipient; and positively; that the sacramental grace
caused by
the validly operated sacramental sign
(p 330)
However; Ott is careful t0 explain that the Catholic
must
be interpreted "in the sense of mechanical or magical efficacy
(p. 330). He says
On the contrary; in the case of the adult recipient faith is expressly
demanded
nevertheless the subjective disposition ot the recipient
not the cause of grace;
is merely an indispensable precondition of
the communication of grace
The measure of the grace effected ex
opere operato even depends on the
of the subjective disposition:
(p 330)
In giving
response t0 this Roman Catholic teaching
we should
remember that the Reformation centered upon this issue. Martin
Luther"
concern was t0 teach that salvation depends on faith
alone_
not on faith plus works. But if baptism and participating in
the other sacraments are necessary for salvation because
are
necessary for receiving saving grace, then salvation really is based
on faith plus works.
contrast t0 this, the clear New Testament
message
that justification is by faith alone: "By grace you have
been saved through faith; and this is not your Own doing_
it is the
gift of God
because of works, lest any man should boast"
(Eph. 2.8-9). Moreover; "the free gift of God is eternal
life in Christ
Jesus our Lord" (Rom: 6.23).

The Roman Catholic argument that baptism is necessary for
salvation is very similar to the argument of Paul's opponents in
Galatia who said that circumcision was necessary for salvation_
Paul $ response is that those who require circumcision are
preaching
different gospel" (Gal. 1.6) . He says that "all who rely
on works 0f the law are under
CUISE
(Gal. 3:10) , and speaks very
severely to those who attempt to add any form of obedience as
requirement for justification: "You are severed from Christ; YOU
who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from
grace'
(Gal: 5.4). Therefore_
we must conclude that n0 work is
necessary for salvation. And therefore baptism
not necessary for
salvation.
But what about John 3.5, "Unless one is born of water and the
Spirit; he cannot enter the kingdom of God"? Although some have
understood this as
reference t0 baptism
it is better understood
against the background of the promise of the new covenant
Ezekiel 36_

your uncleannesses_
and from all your idols

people: In the light of this; to be born of water and the Spirit is

Similarly, Titus 3.5 specifies not water baptism but "the

that it is -

Water baptism is simply not mentioned in this passage_
spiritual
rather than literal washing is also referred t0 in Ephesians
5.26
where Paul says that Christ gave himself up for the church
"that he might sanctify
having cleansed her by the washing of
water with the word:
It is the Word of God that does the washing

from the subjective disposition of the recipient or the minister (a
position that is consistent with baptizing infants,
who do not

Testament examples exist t0 prove this view; nor is there New
Testament testimony t0 indicate this Rather; the narrative accounts
of those who were baptized indicate that
had first come

about baptism
also indicate the need of
faith: When
Paul says
You were buried with him in baptism, in which yOu
were also raised

he immediately specifies "through faith
in the working of God, who raised him from the dead" (Col. 2.12).
Finally,; what about
Peter 3.21,
where Peter says_
"Baptism
now saves you
Does this not give clear support tO the Roman
Catholic view that baptism itself brings saving grace [O the
recipient?
No, for when
uses this phrase he continues in the
same sentence

as an inward, spiritual transaction
between God and the individual;
transaction symbolized by the
ceremony of baptism). We could paraphrase Peter' $

baptism represents

Peter 3.21 certainly does not teach that baptism saves people
automatically or confers
ex opere operato. It does not even
teach that the act of baptism itself has saving power; but rather that
salvation comes about through the inward exercise of faith that is
represented by baptism (cf. Col. 2.12). In fact; Protestants who
advocate believers' baptism might well see in
Peter 3.21 some
support for their position: baptism, it might be argued, is
appropriately administered to anyone who is old enough personally
make
an appeal to God for
clear conscience.
In conclusion_
the Roman Catholic
that baptism is
necessary fOr salvation, that the act
baptism in itself confers
saving grace, and that baptism is therefore appropriately
administered [0 infants_
are not persuasive in the light of New
Testament teachings.
Alternative #2: The Protestant Paedobaptist View: In contrast both to
the Baptist position defended in the earlier part of this chapter and to the
Roman Catholic view just discussed
another important view is that baptism is
rightly administered t0 all infant children of believing parents. This is
common view in many Protestant groups (especially Lutheran; Episcopalian,
Methodist; Presbyterian and Reformed churches). This view is sometimes
known as the covenant argument for paedobaptism: It is called
'covenant"
argument because it depends on seeing infants bor to believers as part of the
covenan
community'
of God's people:
The word
paedobaptism
means the
practice of baptizing infants (the prefix paido
means
child" and is derived
from the Greek word pais, "child" )-
will be
interacting primarily with the
arguments put forth by Louis Berkhof; who explains clearly and defends well
the paedobaptist position:
The argument that infants of believers should be baptized depends
primarily on the
following three points:
Infants Were Circumcised in the Old Covenant: In the Old Testament;
circumcision was the outward sign of entrance into the covenant community
or the community of God $ people.
Circumcision was administered [0 all
Israelite children (that is
male children) when they were eight days old:
b. Baptism Is Parallel to Circumcision: In the New Testament; the outward
sign of entrance into the
covenant community" is baptism: Therefore
baptism is the New Testament counterpart t0 circumcision. It follows that
baptism should be administered t0 all infant children of
believing parents
glace
teachings
them this benefit is t0 deprive them of them
privilege and benefit that
is rightfully theirs
the sign of
belonging to the community of God's people
the
covenant community:
The parallel between circumcision and baptism is
seen quite clearly in Colossians 2:
In him also you were circumcised with
circumcision made without
hands
by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ;
and you were buried with him in baptism, in which yOu were also
raised with him through faith in the working of God
who raised him
from the dead: (Col. 2.11-12)
Here it is said that Paul makes an explicit connection between circumcision
and baptism
Household Baptisms: Further support for the practice of baptizing infants
is found in the
household baptisms" reported in Acts and the epistles,
particularly the baptism of the household of Lydia (Acts 16.15), the family of
the Philippian jailer (Acts 16.33), and the household of
Stephanas
Cor:
1.16). It is also claimed that Acts 2.39,
which declares that the promised
of the gospel is "to yOu and to YOur children;
supports this practice
In response
these arguments for paedobaptism; the following points may be
made:
(1) It is certainly true that baptism and circumcision are in many
ways similar; but we muSt not forget that what they symbolize is
also different
some important ways_
The old covenant had
physical, external means of entrance into the
covenant
community.
One became
Jew by being born of Jewish parents.
Therefore all Jewish males were circumcised_
Circumcision was nOt
restricted t0 people who had tnue inward spiritual life; but rather
given to all who lived among the people of Israel. God said:
Every male among you shall be circumcised.
He that is eight days
old among you shall be circumcised; every male throughout your
generations,
whether born in your house, or bought with your money
from any foreigner who is not of your offspring
both ne that is born
your house and he that is bought with your money; shall be
circumcised_
(Gen: 17.10-13)
was not only the physical descendants of the people of Israel who
were circumcised, but also those servants who were purchased by
deny
blessing -
them and lived among them: The presence or absence of inward
spiritual life made no difference whatsoever in the question of
whether one was circumcised. So
Abraham took
shmael his son
and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money; every
male among the men of Abraham
house, and he circumcised the
flesh of their foreskins that very day; as God had said to him
(Gen:
17.23; cf: Josh: 5.4).
We should realize that circumcision was given
every male
living
among the people of Israel even though true circumcision is
something inward and spiritual: "Real
circumcision is
matter of
the heart, spiritual and not literal" (Rom: 2.29). Moreover; Paul in
the
Testament explicitly states that
not all who are descended
from Israel belong to Israel" (Rom. 9.6). But even though there was
at the time of the Old Testament (and more fully in the time of the
New Testament)
realization of the inward spiritual reality that
circumcision was intended
represent, there was no attempt tO
restrict circumcision only to those whose hearts were actually
circumcised spiritually and who had genuine saving faith: Even
among the adult males
circumcision was
applied to everyone, not
those who gave evidence of inward faith_
(2) But under the new covenant the situation is very different: The
New Testament does not talk about
covenant community" made
up of believers and their unbelieving children and relatives and
servants who happen t0 live among them: (In
in the discussion
of baptism, the phrase
covenant community
as used by
paedobaptists often tends
tunction as
broad and vague term that
blurs the differences between the Old Testament and the New
Testament on this matter:) In the New Testament church; the only
question that matters is whether one has saving faith and has been
spiritually incorporated into the body of Christ, the true church:
only
covenant community'
discussed is the church, the fellowship
of the redeemed:
But how does one become
member of the church? The means of
entrance into the church is
voluntary; spirimual, and internal. One
becomes
member of the true church by being born
and by
having saving faith, not by physical birth. It comes about not by an
externaz
act; but by internal faith in one's heart: It is certainly true
that baptism is the sign of entrance into the church, but this means
that it should only be given
those who give evidence of
New
JuSt

The

membership in the church; only t0 those who profess faith in
Christ
We should not be surprised that there was
change from the way
the covenant community
entered in the Old Testament
(physical birth) to the way the church is entered in the New
Testament (spiritual birth). There are many analogous changes
between the old and new covenants in other areas as well. While
the Israelites fed on physical manna in the wilderness_
New
Testament believers feed on Jesus Christ; the true bread that comes
down from heaven (John 6.48-51). The Israelites drank physical
water that gushed from the rock in the wilderness, but those who
believe in Christ drink of the living water of eternal life that he
gives (John 4.10-14). The old covenant had
physical temple to
which Israel
came for worship_
but in the new covenant believers
built into
spiritual temple ( 1 Peter 2.5). Old covenant believers
offered physical sacrifices of animals and crops upon an altar; but
New Testament believers offer "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
God through Jesus Christ"
Peter 2.5; cf. Heb. 13.15-16). Old
covenant believers received from God the physical land of Israel
which he had promised to them; but New Testament believers
receive
better country; that is,
heavenly one
(Heb: 11.16). In
the same way; in the old covenant those who were the physical seed
descendants of Abraham were members of the people of Israel,
but in the New Testament those who are the spiritual
seed" 0r
descendants of Abraham by faith are members of the church (Gal.
3.29; cf: Rom: 411-12).
In all these contrasts we see the truth of the distinction that Paul
emphasizes between the old covenant and the new covenant The
physical elements and activities of the old covenant were
only
shadow of what is tO come_
but the true reality, the "substance;
found in the new covenant relationship which we have in Christ
(Col. 2.17). Therefore it is consistent with this change of systems
that infant (male
children would automatically be circumcised in
the old covenant; since their physical descent and physical presence
the community of Jewish people meant that they were members
of that community
which faith was not an entrance requirement.
But in the new covenant it is
appropriate that infants not be
baptized, and that baptism only be given
those who give
evidence of genuine saving faith, because membership in the
church is based on an internal spiritual reality, not on physical
descent
The examples of household baptisms in the
[estament are
really not decisive for one position 0r another: When we look at the
actual examples more closely; we see that in
number of them
there are indications of saving faith on the part of all of those
baptized:
For example, it is true that the family of the Philippian
jailer was baptized (Acts 16.33), but it is also true that Paul and
Silas
spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his
house
(Acts 16.32). If the Word of the Lord was spoken t0 all in
the house, there is an assumption that all were old enough to
understand the word and believe it Moreover; after the family had
been baptized
read that the
Philippian jailer "rejoiced with all
his household that he had believed in God" (Acts 16.34). So we
have not only
household baptism but also
household reception
of the Word of God and
household rejoicing in faith in God
These facts suggest
strongly that the entire household had
individually come
faith in Christ.
with
regard
the fact that Paul baptized
household of
Stephanas'
Cor: 116), we must also note that Paul says at the
end of
Corinthians that "the household of Stephanas were the first
converts in Achaia
and
have devoted themselves t0 the service
of the saints
(1 Cor: 16.15). So they were not only baptized; they
were also converted and had worked at serving other believers
Once again the example of household baptism gives indication of
household faith:
there are other instances where baptism is not mentioned
but where we see explicit testimony t0 the fact that an entire
household had come t0 faith After Jesus healed the official'$ son ,
read that the father "himself believed
and all his household"
(John 4.53). Similarly; when Paul preached at Corinth,
Crispus_
the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all
his household " (Acts 18.8).
This means that of all the examples of "household baptisms" in the
New Testament; the only one that does nOr have some indication of
household faith as well is Acts 16.14-15, speaking of Lydia: "The
Lord opened her heart t0 give heed tO what was said by Paul.
And
when she was baptized, with her household_

we should note that the sentence
continues as follows: "For the promise

(Acts 2.39). Moreover; the same paragraph
specifies not that believers and unbelieving children were baptized,
but that
those who received his word were baptized, and there were
added that

further argument in objection to the paedobaptist position can
be made when we ask the simple question; "What does baptism
do?" In other words_
we might ask; "What does it actually
accomplish? What benefit does it bring?"
Roman Catholics have

question: Baptism

But at this point it seems apparent that the paedobaptist

that

the heart of the question_
For the Baptist, baptism primarily bears
witness [0 what we d in
responding to the grace of God. For the
paedobaptist; it primarily bears witness t0 what God has done t0 make
ic all possible
(chapter 3, emphasis his)
But several points can be noted in response
Green: (a) His
analysis at this point overlooks the fact that baptism does not only
symbolize Christ'$ death and resurrection; as we have seen in the
foregoing analysis of New Testament texts_
it also symbolizes the
application of redemption
result of our response of faith:
Baptism pictures the fact that we have been united with Christ in
his death and resurrection_
and the
with water symbolizes
that we have been cleansed from our sins
saying that the
paedobaptist stresses God'$ initiative and the Baptist stresses man'$
response, Green has presented the reader with two incorrect
alternatives from which t0 choose
because baptism pictures both of
these and more_
Baptism pictures

washing
application of the benefits of redemption t0 my life. Believers
baptism pictures all three aspects (not just my faith, as Green
suggests), but according t0 Green
view paedobaptism pictures
only the first one_
It is not
question of which is
primary'
it is
question of which view of baptism includes all that baptism stands
for:
(b) When Green says that our salvation does not depend on our
faith bur on God'$ work, the expression
depend on
is capable of
various interpretations. If "depend on
means
what we rely on,
then of course both sides would agree that we rely on Christ'$ work,
not on our faith: If "depend on" means that faith does not have any
merit in itself whereby we can earn favor with God, then also both
sides would agree. But if "depend on
means it makes no difference
to our salvation whether we believe Or not, then neither side would
agree:
Green himself says in the previous sentence that baptism
does us no good unless we repent and believe. Therefore
baptism
any way represents the application of redemption tO
person $
life _
then
is not enough to practice
form of baptism that only
pictures Christ' $ death and resurrection; we should also picture our
response in faith and the subsequent application of redemption t0
us. By contrast; on Green
view, there iS
real
danger of
portraying
view (which Green would disagree with) that people
will have salvation applied t0 them by God whether they believe or
not:
Finally; those who advocate believers' baptism often express
concern about the practical
consequences of paedobaptism
They
argue that the practice of paedobaptism in actual church life
frequently leads persons baptized in infancy t0 presume that
have been regenerated, and thereby they fail to feel the urgency of
their need t0 come [0 personal
in Christ. Over
period of
years, this tendency is likely tO result in more and more
unconverted members of the
covenant community
members
who are nOt truly members ot Christ $ church
Of course_
this
would not make
paedobaptist church
false church, but it would
make it a less-pure church, and one that will frequently be fighting
tendencies tOward liberal doctrine or other kinds of unbelief that are
brought in by the unregenerate sector of the membership.
The Effen
[aptiai
they
Faith
We have
argued above that baptism symbolizes regeneration or
spiritual rebirth
But does it only symbolize? Or is there some way
in which it is also
means of grace,
that is_
means that the Holy
Spirit uses tO
to people? We have already discussed
this question in the previous chapter;
sO here it only is necessary
to say that when baptism is properly carried out then of course it
brings some spiritual benefit to believers as well.
There is the
blessing of God' s favor that comes with all obedience_
as well as
the joy that comes through public profession of one s faith; and the
reassurance of
clear physical picture of dying and
with Christ and of
away sins. Certainly the Lord gave uS
baptism t0 strengthen and encourage our faith
and it should do s0
for everyone who is baptized and for every believer who witnesses
baptism.
Whe Aenent
LAPEni
While we recognize that Jesus commanded baptism (Matt 28:19),
did the apostles (Acts 2.38), we should not say that baptism is
necessary for salvation:
This question was discussed
some
extent above under the response t0 the Roman Catholic view of
baptism To say that baptism Or any other action is necessary for
salvation is t0 say that we are not justified by faith alone; but by
faith plus
certain
work,
the work of baptism The apostle Paul
would have opposed the idea that baptism is necessary for salvation
just as strongly as he opposed the similar idea that circumcision
was necessary for salvation (see Gal. 5.1-12).
Those who argue that baptism
necessary for salvation often point
Mark 16.16: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but
he who does not believe will be condemned
But the very evident
dmswer (C
this is simply t0 say that the verse says nothing about
those who believe and are not baptized.
The verse is simply
about genera
cases
without making
pedantic qualification for the
unusual case of someone who believes and is not baptized
But
certainly the verse should not be pressed into service and made to
of something it is not talking about:
More to the point is Jesus
statement t0 the
dying thief on the cross,
"Today you will be with me in Paradise
(Luke 23.43). The thief
could not be baptized before he died on the cross_
but he was

certainly saved that
Moreover; the force of this point cannot be
evaded by arguing that the thief was saved under the old covenant
(under which baptism was not necessary t0 salvation), because the
new covenant took effect at the death of Jesus (see Heb. 9.17), and
Jesus died before either of the two thieves who were crucified with
him (see John 19.32-33).
Another reason why baptism is not necessary for salvation is that
our justification from sins takes place at the point of saving faith,
not at the
point of water baptism, which usually occurs later:
But
if a person is already justified and has sins forgiven eternally at the
point of saving faith, then baptism is not necessary for forgiveness
of sins
or for the bestowal of new spiritual life.
Baptism, then; is not necessary for salvation. But
is necessary
we are t0 be obedient
Christ; for he commanded baptism for all
who believe in him.
The Aet [or DAntine
Those who are convinced by the arguments for believers
baptism
must then
begin to ask;
How old should children be before they
are baptized?"
The most direct answer is that they should be old enough t0 give
believable profession of faith: It is impossible t0 set
precise age
that will apply to every child_
but when parents see convincing
evidence of genuine spiritual life_
and also some
understanding regarding the meaning of trusting in Christ, then
baptism is appropriate. Of course
this will require careful
administration by the church;
well as
explanation by
parents in their homes. The exact age for baptism will vary from
child to child, and somewhat from church t0 church as well.
Kemuling Qucticns
1. Do Churches Need to Be Divided Over Baptism?
spite of many years
of division over this question among Protestants, is there
way in which
Christians who differ on baptism can demonstrate greater unity of fellowship?
And is there
way that progress can be made in bringing the church closer to
unity on this question?
day-
degree
good
One way forward could be for paedobaptists and advocates of
believers' baptism both to come t0
common admission that
baptism is not
major doctrine f the faith; and that they are willing
[O live with each other"
views 0n this matter and not allow
differences over baptism to be
cause for division within the body
of Christ.
Specifically; this would mean allowing both views of
baptism to be taught and practiced in denominations on both sides
of the question
No doubt this would be
difficult
to do both for Baptist
denominations and for paedobaptist denominations
because they
have
traditions of arguing for one side Or the other on this
question.
Certainly Christians are entitled [O make up their Own
minds regarding baptism; but it does nOt seem appropriate that
denominational divisions should depend on and reinforce these
differences
does it seem right that churches require one view Or
another on baptism for those who wish to be ordained or to function
as teachers within the church:
Specifically; this would mean that
Baptist churches would have to be willing to allow into
membership those who had been baptized as infants and whose
conviction of conscience
after careful consideration,
that their
infant baptism was valid and should not be repeated. Of course;
Baptist churches could be free t0 teach and
attempt
persuade
prospective church members that they should be baptized as
believers, but if some, after careful consideration, are simply not
persuaded, it does not seem appropriate to make this
barrier [0
membership. What good is accomplished by such
barrier? And
certainly much harm can be accomplished in failure to demonstrate
the unity of the church and in barring from full participation in the
church those whom the Lord has in fact brought into that
fellowship.
On the other hand_
those who believe
paedobaptism would have
agree not to put undue pressure upon parents who do not wish t0
have their infants baptized and not t0 count those parents as
somehow disobedient to the Lord. There might need to be
willingness to have some kind of brief ceremony of dedication of
children to the Lord shortly after
are bom_
instead of _
ceremony of baptism; if the parents s0 desired_
And of course both
sides would have
agree not t0 make one view on baptism
criterion for church office or for ordination.
thing
long
nor
they
If such concessions in actual practice were made by both sides on
this question, the issue might in fact diminish the level of
controversy within
generation; and baptism might eventually
cease t0 be
point of division at all among Christians.
Who Can Baptize? Finally;
may ask;
Who can perform the ceremony
of baptism? Can only ordained
perform this ceremony?"
We should
recognize here that Scripture simply does not specify
any restrictions 0n who can perform the ceremony of baptism:
Those churches that have
special priesthood through which
certain actions (and blessings
come
(such as Roman Catholics
and
LO some extent Anglicans) will wish t0 insist that only properly
ordained
should baptize in ordinary circumstances (though
exceptions could be made in unusual circumstances). But if we
truly believe in the priesthood of all believers (see
Peter 2.4-10),
then there seems tO be no need in principle t0 restrict the right to
perform baptism only
ordained clergy:
However; another consideration arises: Since baptism
the sign of
entrance into the body of Christ; the church (cf.
Cor: 12.13 on
inward spiritual baptism), then
seems appropriate that it be done
within the fellowship of the church wherever possible; so that the
church as
whole can rejoice
the person being baptized and s0
that the faith of all believers in that church might be built up.
Moreover, since
baptism is
sign of beginning the Christian life
and therefore of beginning life in the true church as well, it is fitting
that the local church be assembled to give testimony t0 this fact and
LO give visible welcome to the baptized person
Also
in order thar
the people being baptized have
right understanding of what
actually is happening
it is right for the church to safeguard the
practice of baptism and
from abuse. Finally; if baptism is the
sign of entering the fellowship of the visible church; then
seems
appropriate that some officially designated representative Or
representatives of the church be selected t0 administer it. For these
reasons it is usually the ordained
who baptize; but there
seems t0 be nO reason why the church from time
time
and where
deems
appropriate, might not call on other church officers or
mature believers [0
baptize new converts_
For example, someone
effective in evangelism in
local church may be an appropriately

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
Romans 6:3-4: Do YOu not know that all of us who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him
by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory
of the Father;
might walk in newness of life.
HYMN
"Up From the Grave He Arose
There are few familiar hymns written specifically to be used during
baptisma
service: It would be helpful for the church if more were
written:
This hymn is appropriate for the topic of baptism, because it speaks
triumphantly of Christ'
resunection: When we
it, we should
realize that Jesus not only triumphed over death and the grave for
himself; but also for all of uS who believe in him. This fact is
vividly symbolized in the ceremony of baptism:

The Lord's Supper
What is the meaning of the Lord'$ Supper? How should it be
observed?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Lord Jesus instituted tWo ordinances (0r sacraments) t0 be
observed by the church 'The previous chapter discussed baptism, an
ordinance that is only observed once by each person, as
sign of
the beginning of his or her Christian life_
This chapter discusses the
Lord $ Supper; an ordinance that is to be observed repeatedly
throughout our Christian lives_
sign of continuing in fellowship
with Christ
DACEETMd
Relemptiol
Jesus instituted the Lord s Supper in the following way:
Now as
were
eating; Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it,
and
it t0 the disciples and said, " Take
eat; this
my body:'
And
he took
cup_
and when he had given thanks he gave it
then,
"Drink of it; all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant_
which is
poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
tell you
shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when
drink
new with yOu in my Father's kingdom: (Matt: 26.26-29)
Paul adds the following sentences from the tradition he received (1 Cor:
11.23):
This cup is the new covenant in my blood
Do this; as often as yOu
drink it; in remembrance of me
Cor: 11.25)
Is there
background
this ceremony in the Old Testament? It
seems thar there
for there were instances of eating and
in the presence of God
the old covenant as well. For example_
Mrton
they
Bave
saying:
drinking
when the people of Israel were camped before Mount Sinai, just
after God had given the Ten Commandments_
God called the
leaders of Israel up to the mountain t0 meet with him:
Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab
and Abihu_
and seventy of the elders
ot Israel went uP_
and they saw the God of Israel
they beheld God,
and ate and drank (Ex 24.9-11)
Moreover; every year the people of Israel were
tithe (give one-
tenth of) all their crops. Then the law of Moses specified,
Before the LORD your God, in the place which he will choose, to make
his name dwell there, You shall eat the tithe of your grain, of your
wine, and of your oil, and the firstlings of your herd and flock; that
YOu may learn t0 fear the LORD your God always_
You shall eat
there before the LORD your God and rejoice, You and your household.
(Deut 14.23,26)
But even earlier than
God had put Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden and given them all of its abundance tO eat (except
the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) Since there
was n0 sin in that situation, and since God had created them for
fellowship with himself and to glorify himself; then every meal that
Adam and Eve ate would have been
meal of feasting in the
presence of the Lord.
When this fellowship in God $ presence was later broken by sin;
God still allowed some meals (such as the tithe of fruits mentioned
above) that the people would eat in his presence. These meals were
restoration of the fellowship with God that Adam and Eve
enjoyed before the Fall;
pven
though it was marred by sin. But the
fellowship of eating in the presence of the Lord that we find in the
Lord'
Supper is far better: The Old Testament sacrificial meals
continually pointed tO the fact that sins were not yet paid
because the sacrifices in them were repeated year after year; and
because they looked forward to the Messiah who was t0 come and
take away sin (see Heb. 10:1-4). The Lord's Supper; however;
reminds US that Jesus
payment for our sins has already been
accomplished
nOw ear
the Lord'
presence with
rejoicing
Yet even the Lord's Supper looks forward to
more
wonderful
fellowship meal
God
presence in the future
when the
that;
partial
for;
great
fellowship of Eden will be restored and there will be even greater
joy, because those who eat in God*s presence will be forgiven
sinners nOW confirmed in righteousness, never able to sin again_
That future time of great
rejoicing and eating in the presence of
God is hinted at by Jesus when he says_
tell you
shall not drink
of this fruit of the vine until that day when
drink it new with
YOu in my Father'$ kingdom'
(Matt: 26.29). We are told more
explicitly in Revelation about the
supper of the Lamb:
"And the angel said to me_
Write this: Blessed
those who are
invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb'
(Rev: 19.9). This
time of great rejoicing in the presence of the Lord
as well as
time of reverence and awe before him:
From Genesis t0 Revelation, then; God' s aim has been
bring his
people into fellowship with himself, and one of the great joys of
experiencing that fellowship is the fact that we can eat and drink
the presence of the Lord_
It would be healthy for the church today

The meaning of the Lord's Supper is complex, rich, and full. There
are several
symbolized and affirmed in the Lord $ Supper:
Christ's Death:
When we
participate in the Lord's supper we symbolize
the death of Christ because Our actions give
picture of his death for uS_
When the bread is broken
symbolizes the breaking of Christ"s body, and
when the cup is poured out it symbolizes the pouring out of Christ $ blood for
us. This is why participating in the Lord's Supper is also
kind of
proclamation:
For as often as yOu eat this bread and drink the cup, yOu
proclaim the Lord $ death until he comes'
Cor: 11.26).
Our Participation in the Benefits of Christ's Death: Jesus commanded
his disciples_
"Take
eat; this is my body" (Matt: 26.26). As we individually
reach out and take the cup for ourselves_
each one of us is by that action
proclaiming;
am taking the benefits of Christ $ death t0 myself:
When
do this we give
symbol of the tact that we participate in 0 share in the
benefits earned for us by the death of Jesus.
3. Spiritual Nourishment: Just as ordinary food nourishes our physical
bodies, so the bread and wine of the Lord 's Supper give nourishment tO 4S.
But
also picture the fact that there

refreshment that Christ is giving tO our souls
-indeed, the ceremony that
Jesus instituted is in its
nature
designed to teach us this. Jesus said,
Unless You eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood_
you
have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
eternal life, and
raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and
drinks my blood abides in me; and
in him. As the living Father sent
me_
and
live because of the Father; sO he who eats me will live
because of me. (John 6.53-57)
Certainly Jesus
not
speaking of
literal
of his flesh and blood. But if
he is not speaking of
literal eating and drinking; then he must have in mind
spiritual participation
the benefits of the redemption he earns. This spiritual
nourishment;
necessary for Our souls, is both symbolized and experienced
in our participation in the Lord'$ Supper:
The Unity of Believers:
When Christians participate in the Lord's
together
also give
clear sign of their unity with one another: In
Paul says_
"Because there is one bread_
we who are many are one body; for
all partake of the one bread"
Cor: 10.17).
When we put these four
together; we begin to realize some of
the rich meaning of the Lord s
Supper: when
participate
come
into the presence of Christ;
remember that he died for me;
participate in the benefits of his death;
receive spiritual
nourishment; and
am united with all other believers who

joy is to be found in this Supper

But in addition t0 these truths visibly portrayed by the Lord s
Supper; the fact that Christ has instituted this ceremony for 4S
means that by it he

uS as well.
When we participate in the Lord $ Supper; we should be
reminded
and again of the following affirmations that Christ
is making

love for Christ are richly intermingled in the beauty of the Lord's Supper:

The Roman Catholic View: Transubstantiation: According to the
teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, the bread and wine actually become
the body and blood of Christ. This happens at the moment the priest says,
"This is my body" during the celebration of the mass_
At the same time as the
priest says this_
the bread is raised up (elevated) and adored: This action of
elevating the bread and pronouncing
to be Christ'$ body can only be
performed by
priest:
When this happens, according to Roman Catholic teaching; grace is
imparted t0 those present ex opere operato
that is, "by the work
performed,
but the amount of grace dispensed is in proportion t0
the subjective disposition of the recipient of grace
Moreover;
every time the mass is celebrated, the sacrifice of Christ is repeated
(in some sense), and the Catholic church is careful to affirm that
this is
real sacrifice;
even though it is not the same as the sacrifice
that Christ paid on the cross
So Ludwig Ott'$ Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma teaches as
follows:
Christ becomes present in the Sacrament of the Altar by the
Blessings

transformation of the whole substance of the bread into His Body and
of the whole substance of the wine into His Blood_
This
transformation is called Transubstantiation_
(p. 379)
The power of consecration resides in
validly consecrated priest only
(p. 397)
The Worship of Adoration (Latria) must be given t0 Christ present in
the Eucharist.
It follows from the wholeness and permanence of the
Real Presence that the absolute worship of adoration (Cultus Latriae) is
due t0 Christ present in the Eucharist: (p_
387)
Catholic teaching_
because the elements
bread and wine literally become
the body and blood of Christ; the church for many centuries did not allow the
lay people t0 drink from the cup of the Lord's Supper (for fear that the blood
of Christ would be spilled) but only
eat the bread_
Ott' $ textbook tells us
Communion under two forms is not necessary for any individual
member of the Faithful, either
by reason of Divine precept Or a5
means 0f salvation:
The reason
that Christ is whole and entire
under each species:
The abolition of the reception from the chalice
in the Middle Ages ( 12th and 13th centuries) was enjoined for
practical
reasons, particularly danger of profanation of the Sacrament:
(p. 397)
With respect t0 the actual sacrifice of Christ in the mass, Ott'$ textbook says_
The Holy Mass is
true and proper Sacrifice
(p. 402)
In the Sacrifice of the Mass and in the Sacrifice of the Cross the
Sacrificial Gift and the
Sacrificing Priest are identical; only the
nature and mode of the
different:
The Sacrificial Gift is
the Body and Blood of Christ:
The Primary Sacrificing Priest is
Jesus Christ; who utilizes the human priest as His servant and
representative and fulfills the consecration through him. According to
the Thomistic view; in every Mass Christ also performs an actual
immediate sacrificial activity which, however; must not be conceived as
totality of many successive acts but as one single uninterupted
sacrificial act of the Transfigured Christ:
The purpose of the Sacrifice is the same in the Sacrifice of the Mass as
in the Sacrifice of the Cross_
primarily the
glorification of God,
Primary

secondarily atonement, thanksgiving and appeal. (p_
408)
propitiatory sacrifice
the Sacrifice of the Mass effects the
remission of sins and the punishment for sins; as
sacrifice of appeal
about the
conferring of supernatural and natural gifts.
The
Eucharistic Sacrifice of propitiation can, as the Council of Trent
expressly asserted_
be offered, not merely for the living; but also for the
poor souls in
Purgatory (pp. 412-13)
In response to the Roman Catholic teaching on the Lord's Supper; it
must be said that
first fails t0
recognize the symbolic character of
Jesus' statements when he declared; " This is my body;
This
my blood:
Jesus spoke in symbolic ways many times when
speaking of himself: He said, for example,
am the true vine
(John 15.1), or
am the door; if any one enters by me; he will be
saved" (John 10.9), or
am the bread which came down from
heaven'
(John 6.41). In a similar way; when Jesus says, "This is my
body;
he means it in
symbolic way; not in an actual, literal,
physical way. In
as he was
with his disciples
the bread_
the bread was in his hand but it was distinct from his
body; and that was;
ot course
evident t0 the disciples. None of the
disciples present would have thought that the loaf of bread that
Jesus held in his hand was actually his physical body; for
could
his body before their eyes. They would have naturally
understood Jesus
statement in
symbolic way: Similarly; when
Jesus said
"This cup which is poured out for YOu is the new
covenant in my blood" (Luke 22.20), he certainly did not mean that
the cup was actually the new covenant, but that the cup represented
the new covenant:
Moreover; the Roman Catholic view fails tO recognize the clear
New Testament teaching on the finality and completeness of
Christ' $ sacrifice once for all time for OuI sins: the book of Hebrews
emphasizes this many times
when
says
Nor was
to offer
himself repeatedly; as the high priest enters the
Place yearly
with blood not his own; for then he would have had t0 suffer
repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has
appeared once for all at the end of the age
put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself
Christ, having been offered once to bear the
sins of many" (Heb. 9.25-28). To say that Christ $ sacrifice
continues Or is repeated in the mass has been, since the
Reformation, one of the most objectionable Roman Catholic
brings
fach,
sitting

they
Holy
doctrines from the standpoint of Protestants
When we realize that
Christ' $ sacrifice for 0ur sins is finished and completed
"It is
finished,
John 19.30; cf. Heb: 1.3), it gives great assurance [0 US
that our sins are all paid
and there remains no sacrifice yet t0 be
paid:
But the idea of
continuation of Christ'$ sacrifice destroys
ouI assurance that the payment has been made by Christ and
accepted by God the Father; and that there is
no condemnation"
(Rom: 8.1) now remaining for uS.
For Protestants the idea that the mass
in any sense
repetition of
the death of Christ seems [0 mark
return t0 the repeated sacrifices
of the old covenant; which were
reminder of sin year after year"
(Heb. 10.3). Instead of the assurance of complete forgiveness of
sins through the once for all sacrifice of Christ (Heb: 10:12) , the
idea that the mass is
repeated sacrifice gives
constant reminder
of sins and remaining guilt to be atoned for week after week:
With
regard t0 the
that only priests can officiate at the
Lord's Supper; the New Testament gives no instructions at all that
place restrictions on the people who can preside at Communion_
And
Scripture places no such restrictions on US
would not
seem [0 be
justified
say that only priests can dispense the
elements of the Lord $
Moreover; since the New Testament
teaches that all believers are priests and members of
royal
priesthood" (1 Peter 2.9; cf:
Heb. 4.16; 10.19-22), we should not
specify
certain class of people who have the rights of priests, as in
the old covenant; but we should emphasize that all believers share
the great spiritual privilege of coming near to God_
Finally, any continuation of the restriction that will not allow
laypersons to drink of the cup of the Lord's Supper would be
arguing from caution and tradition tO justify disobedience to Jesus
direct commands; not only the command to his disciples where he
said, "Drink of it, all of you
(Matt. 26.27), but also the direction
Paul recorded_
in which Jesus said, "Do this_
as Often as You drink
it, in remembrance of me" (1 Cor: 11.25).
2. The Lutheran View: Consubstantiation: Martin Luther rejected the
Roman Catholic view of the Lord's Supper; yet he insisted that the phrase
"This
my body'=
had to be taken in some sense aS
literal statement: His
conclusion was nOt that the bread actually becomes the physical body of
Christ; but that the physical body of Christ is present "in, with, and under" the
for,
teaching "
since
Supper:
bread of the Lord $ Supper: The example sometimes given is tO say that
Christ' $ body
present in the bread as water is present in
sponge
~the
water is not the sponge_
but is present "in,
with, and under"
sponge, and is
present wherever the sponge
present: Other examples given are that of
magnetism
magnet O
soul in the body.
The Lutheran understanding of the Lord s
is found in the
textbook of Francis Pieper; Christian Dogmatics.
He quotes
Luther
Small Catechism:
What is the Sacrament of the Altar? It
is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ; under the bread
and wine, for us Christians t0 eat and to drink; instituted by Christ
Himself:
Similarly; the Augsburg Confession, Article X, says;
"Of the Supper of the Lord
teach that the
Body and Blood of
Christ are truly present; and are distributed t0 those who eat in the
Supper of the Lord
One passage that may be thought t0 give support t0 this position is
Corinthians 10.16,
The bread which we break, is it not a
participation in the body of Christ?"
However; in order t0 affirm this doctrine_
Luther had [0 answer an
important question: How can Christ'$ physical body; Or more
generally Christ's human nature, be everywhere present? Is it not
true that Jesus in his human nature ascended into heaven and
remains there until his return? Did he not say that he was leaving
the earth and would no longer be in the world but was going t0 the
Father (John 16.28; 17:11)? In answer t0 this problem Luther taught
the ubiquity of Christ'$ human nature after his ascension
that is_
that Christ'$ human nature was present everywhere
ubiquitous
But theologians ever since Luther's time have suspected that he
taught the ubiquity of Christ's human nature
not because
found
anywhere in Scripture
but because he needed it to explain how his
view of consubstantiation could be true.
In response t0 the Lutheran view; it can be said that it t0 fails to
realize that Jesus is speaking of
spiritual reality but using physical
objects
teach uS when he says, "This is my body
We should
take this no more literally than we take the
corresponding
sentence,
"This cup which is poured out for
is [he new covenant in my
blood" (Luke 22.20). In fact; Luther does not really do justice t0
Jesus' words in_
literal sense at all. Berkhof rightly objects that

body:
In this matter
would help
read again John 6.27-59,
where the context shows that Jesus is
in literal, physical
terms about bread
but he is continually explaining it in terms of
spiritual reality:
3. The Rest of Protestantism:
Symbolic and Spiritual Presence of
Christ: In distinction from Martin Luther; John Calvin and other Reformers
that the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper did not change into the
body and blood of Christ; nor did
somehow contain the
and blood
of Christ. Rather; the bread and wine symbolized the body and blood of
Christ; and they gave
visible sign of the fact that Christ himself was truly
present:
Calvin said:
By the showing of the symbol the thing itself is also shown. For
unless
man means t0 call God
deceiver; he would never dare assert
that an empty symbol is set forth by him.
And the
godly ought by
all means t0
this rule: whenever they see symbols appointed by
the Lord_
to think and be persuaded that the truth of the thing
signified
is surely present there. For why would the Lord put in your hand the
symbol of his body; except to assure YOu of
true participation in it?
(Institutes, 4.17.10; p. 1371)
Yer Calvin was careful t0 differ both with Roman Catholic
teaching
(which said that the bread became Christ'$ body) and with Lutheran
teaching (which said that the bread contained Christ' s body).
But we must establish such
presence of Christ in the Supper as may
neither fasten him t0 the element of bread, nor enclose him in bread,
nor circumscribe him in any way (all which things, it is clear; detract
from his heavenly glory) . (Institutes, 4.17.19;
1381)
Today most Protestants would say; in addition t0 the fact that the
bread and wine symbolize the body and blood of Christ; that Christ
is also spiritually present in _
special way as
partake of the
bread and wine. Indeed, Jesus promised to be present whenever
believers worship:
Where [WO
three are gathered in my name
there am
in the midst of them" (Matt: 18.20).
And if he is
especially present when Christians
worship_
then we
would expect that he will be present
special way in the Lord $
Supper:
We meet him at his table_
to which he comes t0

As we receive the elements of bread and wine in the
presence of Christ, S0 we partake of him and all his benefits:
We
"feed upon him in our hearts" with thanksgiving: Indeed, even
child who knows Christ will understand this without
told and
will expect [0 receive
special blessing from the Lord during this
ceremony; because the meaning of it is SO inherent in the
actions of
and
drinking: Yet
we must not say that Christ is
present apart from our personal faith; but only meets and blesses US
there in accordance with our faith in him
In what way is Christ present then? Certainly there
symbolic
presence of Christ; but
is also
genuine spiritual presence and
there is genuine spiritual blessing in this ceremony
An Slnuld paricinjie
fupper_
Despite differences over some
aspects of the Lord's Supper; most
Protestants would agree_
first; that only those who believe in Christ
should participate in it; because it is
sign of being
Christian and
continuing
in the Christian life.
Paul warns that those who eat and
drink unworthily face serious consequences:
For any one who eats
and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment
upon himself: That is why many of yOu are weak and ill, and some
have died" (1 Cor: 11.29-30).
Second, many Protestants would argue from the meaning of
baptism and the meaning of the Lord 's Supper that; ordinarily, only
those who have been baptized should participate in the Lord'$
Supper:
because baptism is sO clearly
symbol of beginning
the Christian life ,
while the Lord s Supper is clearly
symbol of
continuing the Christian life. Therefore if someone
the
Lord's Supper and thereby giving public proclamation that he or
she is continuing in the Christian life, then that person should be
asked, "Wouldn'
it be good to be baptized nOw and thereby give
symbol that yOu are beginning the Christian life?"
But others _
including the present author;
Object t0 such
restriction as follows: A different problem arises if someone who is
genuine believer; but not yet baptized
is not allowed t0
participate in the Lord s Supper when Christians get together: In
that case the person
nonparticipation symbolizes that he or she is
no[
member of the body of Christ which is coming together t0
being
very
eating
[his
taking
would
observe the Lord s Supper in
unified fellowship (see
Cor: 10.17:
"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we
all partake of the one bread"_
Therefore churches may think it best
to allow non-baptized believers
participate in the Lord's Supper
but to urge them to be baptized as soon as possible: For if they are
willing
participate in one outward symbol of being
Christian
there seems no reason why
should not be
participate
in the other;
symbol that appropriately comes first:
Of course, the problems that arise in both situations (when
unbaptized believers take Communion and when
do not) can
all be avoided if new Christians are
regularly baptized shortly after
coming to faith. And, whichever position
church takes on the
question of whether unbaptized believers should take Communion;
in the
teaching ministry of the church, it would seem wise to teach
that the ideal situation is for new believers first
be baptized and
then
partake of the Lord's Supper:
The third qualification for participation is that self-examination:
Whoever; therefore_
eats the bread 0r drinks the cup of the Lord in an
unworthy manner will be
guilty of profaning the body and blood of
the Lord_
Let
man examine himself; and so eat of the bread and
drink of the cup.
For any one who eats and drinks without discerning
the body eats and drinks judgment upon himselE:
Cor: 11.27-29)
In the context of
Corinthians 11 Paul is
rebuking the Corinthians for their
selfish and inconsiderate conduct when they come together as
church:
"When YOu meet together; it is not the Lord
suppel
that You eat. For in
each one goes ahead with his Own meal, and one is hungry and another
is drunk" (1 Cor: 11.20-21). This helps uS understand what Paul means when
he talks about those who eat and drink
without discerning the body" (1 Cor:
11:29). The problem at Corinth was not
failure t0 understand that the bread
and cup represented the body and blood of the Lord
certainly knew
that: The problem rather was their selfish; inconsiderate conduct toward each
other while they were at the Lord's table. They were not understanding or
discerning" the true nature of the church as one body This interpretation of
"without discerning the body" is supported by Paul's mention of the church as
the body of Christ just
bit earlier; in
Corinthians 10.17: "Because there is
one bread
we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one
bread_
So the phrase
not discerning the body"
means
not understanding
the unity and interdependence of people in the church, which is the body of
they
willing
they
eating
-they
Christ
It means not
thought for our brothers and sisters when we
come t0 the Lord $
at which we ought t0 reflect his character:
What does
mean
then
to eat or drink "in an unworthy manner "
Cor: 11.27)? We might at first think the words apply rather
narrowly and pertain only tO the way we conduct ourselves when
we actually eat and drink the bread and wine_
Bur when Paul
explains that unworthy participation involves "not discerning the
body;
he indicates that we are t0 take thought for all of our
relationships within the body of Christ: are We
in ways that
vividly portray not the unity of the one bread and one body; but
disunity? Are we conducting ourselves in ways that proclaim not
the self-giving sacrifice of our Lord_
but enmity and selfishness? In
broad sense
"Lec
man examine himself" means that we
ought to ask whether our relationships in the body of Christ are in
fact reflecting the character of the Lord whom we meet there and
whom we represent:
In this connection, Jesus' teaching about coming tO worship in
general should also be mentioned:
So if you are
offering your gift
the altar; and there remember that
your brother has
something against you_
leave your gift there before
the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother; and then come and
offer your gift: (Matt: 5.23-24)
Jesus here tells us that whenever we come t0 worship we should be sure that
our relationships with others are right; and if they are nOL; we should act
quickly to make them right and then come to worship God_
This admonition
ought to be especially true when we come
the Lord $ Supper:
Of course; no pastor Or church leader
know whether people are
examining themselves or not (except in cases where clearly
offensive Or sinful conduct becomes evident
others). For the most
the church must depend on the pastors and teachers
explain
clearly the meaning of the Lord's Supper and to warn of the dangers
participating unworthily Then people will have the
responsibility
examine their Own
in accordance with what
Paul says. Indeed, Paul does nOt say that the pastors should
examine everyone else's lives
but encourages individual self-
examination instead: "Let
man examine himself" (1 Cor: 11.28).

Who should administer the Lord's Supper? Scripture gives no
explicit teaching on this question, SO we are left simply t0 decide
what is wise and appropriate for the benefit of the believers in the
church: In order [0
guard against abuse of the Lord's Supper;
responsible leader ought to be in charge administering it, but
does
not seem that Scripture
requires that only ordained
selected church officers could do this. In ordinary situations, of
couise_
the pastor 0r other leader who ordinarily officiates at the
worship services of the church would appropriately officiate at
Communion as well. But beyond this, there would seem to be no
reason why only officers or only leaders_
or only men, should
distribute the elements_
Would it nOt speak much more clearly of
our unity and spiritual equality in Christ if both men and women,
for example_
assisted in distributing the elements of the Lord's
Supper?
How often should the Lord 's Supper be celebrated? Scripture does
not tell uS
Jesus simply said, "As often as You eat this bread and
drink the cup
Cor: 11.26) . Paul's directive here regarding
worship services would also be appropriate
consider: "Let all
be done for edification" (ICor: 14.26). In actuality it has
been the practice of most of the church throughout its history to
celebrate the Lord 's Supper
week when believers gather:
However; in many Protestant groups since the Reformation, there
has been
less frequent celebration of the Lord $ Supper
sometimes once
month or twice
month, O1, in many Reformed
churches, only four times
year: If the Lord $ Supper is planned
and explained and carried out in such
way that it is
time of self-
examination, confession, and thanksgiving and praise, then it does
seem that celebrating
once
week would be tOO often,
however; and
certainly could be observed that frequently "for

Worship
How can our worship fulfill its great purpose in the New
Testament age? What does it mean
worship "in spirit and in
truth"?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The term worship
sometimes applied t0 all of
Christian $ life_
and it is rightly said that
everything in our life should be an act of
worship, and
everything the church does should be considered
worship, for everything we do should glorify God. However; in this
chapter
am nOt using the word in that broad sense: Rather;
using worship in
more
specific sense t0 refer t0 the music and
words that Christians direct t0 God in praise, together with the heart
attitudes that accompany that praise, especially when Christians
assemble
Since the chapters in this part of the book deal
with the doctrine of the church; it is appropriate in this chapter t0
focus attention on the worship activities of the assembled church:
Definition
WVorthin
Worship is the activity of glorifying God in his presence with our
voices and nearts.
In this definition we note that worship is an act of glorifying God
Yet all aspects of our lives are supposed to glorify God, so this
definition specifies that worship is something we do especially
when we come into God'$ presence, when we are conscious of
adoration of him in our hearts_
and when we praise him with our
voices and speak about him so others may hear: Paul encourages the
Christians in Colossae, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly;
teach and admonish one another in all wisdom, and sing psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts t0
God" (Col. 316).
together:
Te
the primary reason that God called us into the assembly of
the church is that as
corporate assembly we might worship him:
Edmund Clowney wisely says:
God had demanded of Pharaoh,
'Let my people go_
that they may
worship me in the desert" (Ex. 7:16b).
God brings them out that he
might bring them in, into his assembly; to the
company of those
who stand before his face_
God $ assembly at Sinai is therefore the
immediate
of the exodus:
God
his people into his presence
that they might hear his voice and worship nim:
But Clowney explains that the worshiping assembly at Mount Sinai could not
remain
session before God forever: Therefore God established other
festivals in which the whole nation would assemble before him three times
year: He says that "Israelites are
nation formed for worship, called to
assemble in the courts of the Lord, and
praise together the name of the
Most High
Yer Clowney points out
rather than
worshiping God in a
unified, holy assembly; the people turned aside to serving idols and,
rather than
assembling the people to worship before him; "in
judgment God scattered the people in
But God promised that his purposes for his people would yer be
fulfilled, that there would someday be
great assembly not just of
Israel but of all nations before his throne (Isa. 2.2-4; 25.6-8; 49.22;
66.18-21; cf. Jer: 48.47; 49.6, 39).
notes thar the
fulfillment of that promise began only when Jesus started to build
his church:
Pentecost was the time of the firstfruits, the beginning of the great
harvest of redemption. Peter preached the fulfillment of the prophecy of
Joel. The Spirit had been poured Out; the worship of the new age had
been ushered in. The church, the assembly for worship_

Now the ingathering had begun:
The gospel call is
call to worship
to turn from sin and call upon the
name of the Lord:
The picture of the church as
worshiping
assembly
nowhere more powerfully presented than by the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews (12.18-29).

church

then
not optional for the church of
God
Rather; it brings to expression the very being of the church:
Ic manifests 0n earth the reality of the heavenly assembly:
Worship is therefore
direct expression of our ultimate purpose for living;

God

glory; whom

(Isa_
43.6
And Paul uses similar
language when he says that
we who first hoped in Christ have been destined
and appointed 0 live for the praise 0f nis glory
(Eph: 1.12). Scripture
clear here and in many other passages that God created us to glorify him.
When
reflect on the purpose of worship
also reminds US that
God is worthy of worship and we are not: Even the apostle John
had to be told that he should not worship any creature_
nOL even
powerful angel in heaven. When he "fell down tO worship"
at the
feet of the angel who showed him marvelous visions in heaven, the
angel said t0 him;
You must not do that!
Worship God" (Rev:
22.8-9).
This is because God is jealous for his Own honor and he rightly
seeks his Own honor: He says,
the LORD your God am
jealous
God" (Ex. 20.5) and "My glory
will not give tO another" (Isa_
48.11). Something within us should tremble and rejoice at this fact:
We should tremble with fear lest we rob God $ glory from him:
And
should rejoice that it is right that God seek his own honor and
be jealous for his Own honor; forhe; infinitely more than
anything
he has made_
worthy of honor: The twenty-four elders in heaven
feel this reverence and joy; for

and cast their crowns before him
singing; "You

Lord and God, t0 receive glory and honor and power; for yOu
created all things; and by your

(Rev: 4.11).
When we feel the absolute rightness of this
within
ourselves we then have the
appropriate heart attitude for genuine
worship:
Because God

everything

The early church knew such joy in worship_
for "day by day, attending the
temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with
glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people'
(Acts 2.46). In fact; immediately after Jesus
ascension into heaven; the
disciples
retumed to Jerusalem with great joy; and were continually in the
temple blessing God
(Luke 24.52-53)
Of course, such activity of continual praise cannot last forever in
this age, for living in
fallen world requires that we give time to
many other responsibilities as well. But extended praise does give
foretaste of the atmosphere of heaven, where the four living
crealures

(Rev: 4.8) , and the

truth of Scripture

We Draw Near to God The Amazing Unseen Reality of New Covenant
Worship_
In the old covenant believers could only draw near t0 God in
limited way through the temple ceremonies; indeed, most of the people of
[srael
could not enter into the temple itself; but had to remain in the courtyard.
Even the priests could only go into the outer court of the temple, the "Holy
Place,
when
Was
their appointed duty. But into the inner rOOm of the
temple, the "Holy of Holies,
no one could g0 except the high priest; and he
only once
year (Heb. 9.1-7).
Now
under the new covenant, believers have the amazing
privilege
able to enter directly into the holy of holies in heaven
when they worship_
"We have confidence
enter the Most Holy
Place by the blood of Jesus'
(Heb
10.19 NIV)
Since we have that
confidence to enter into the very presence of God, the author of
Hebrews encourages Us, "Let US draw near with
true heart in full
assurance of faith" (Heb: 10.22). Worship in the New Testament
church is nOr
simply practice for some later heavenly experience of
genuine worship_
nor is
simply pretending; or going through some
outward activities. It is genuine worship in the presence of God
himself; and when we worship we enter before his throne.
This reality is expressed more fully by the author of Hebrews in
chapter 12, when he tells Christians that
have not come [0
place like the earthly Mount Sinai where the people of Israel
received the Ten Commandments from God, but
have come t0
something far better; the heavenly Jerusalem:
For YOu have not come L0 what may be touched,
fire_
and
darkness, and gloom, and
tempest; and the sound of
trumpet;, and
gladness,
will

voice whose words made the hearers entreat that no further messages
be spoken to them:
But you have come
Mount Zion and to the
city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem
and t0 innumerable
angels in festal gathering; and to the assembly of the first-born who
are enrolled in heaven, and to
judge who is God of all, and t0 the
spirits of just men made perfect; and to Jesus, the mediator of
new
covenant; and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than
the blood of Abel. (Heb_
12.18-24)
This
the reality of new covenant worship:
actually
worship in the
presence of God, though we do not nOw see him with our physical eyes_
nor
do we see the
angels gathered around his throne or the spirits of believers who
have gone before and are nOw
worshiping in God $ presence_
But it is all
there_
and it is all real, more real and more permanent than the physical
creation that we see around uS,
which will someday be destroyed in the final
judgment And if we believe Scripture t0 be true_
then
must also believe
be actually true that we ourselves come t0 that place and join our voices
with those already
worshiping in heaven whenever we come
God in
worship
Our only appropriate response is this:
Let uS offer [0 God
acceptable worship
with reverence and awe; for our God is
consuming fire'
(Heb. 12.28-29).
God Draws Near t0 Us: James (ells 4S,
"Draw near t0 God and he will
draw near t0
(James 4.8). This has been the pattern of God'$ dealings
with his people throughout the Bible, and we should be confident that it
be true also today:
In the Old Testament; when God '$ people began to praise him at the
dedication of the temple
he descended and made himself known in
their midst:
when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other
musical
instruments_
in praise t0 the LORD_
"For he is

the house
the house of the LORD
was
filled with
cloud, SO that the priests could not stand [0 minister
because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
Chron. 5.13-14)
Though this only speaks of one specific incident; it does not seem wrong
suppose that God will also make his presence known at other times among his
people_
whenever he is pleased with the praise
offer (even if he does not
come in the form of
visible cloud) David says,
Yet you are holy, enthroned
you"
Will

on the praises of Israel" (Ps. 22.3).
God Ministers t0 Us. Although the primary purpose
worship is
glorify God, the Scriptures teach that in worship
something also happens to
uS: we ourselves are built up or edified: To some extent this
happens, of
course, when we
earn from the Bible teachings that are given Or the words of
encouragement that others speak to uS
Paul says, "Let all things be done for
edification'
(1 Cor: 14.26), and he says that we are to "teach and admonish
one another in all
wisdom" (Col. 3.16), and to be "addressing one another in
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs'
(Eph: 5.19; cf: Heb: 10.24-25).
But in addition to the edification that comes from growth in
understanding the Bible and hearing words of encouragement from
others_
there is another kind of edification that occurs in worship:
when we worship God he meets with us and directly ministers to
strengthening our faith; intensifying our awareness of his
presence, and granting refreshment to our spirits.
Peter says that as
Christians are continually coming t0 Christ (in worship and prayer
and faith), they are then "being built up as
spiritual house for
holy priesthood_
t0 offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
God
through Jesus Christ"
Peter 2.5 NASB) When we come t0
worship we come into God's presence in
special way; and we may
expect that he will meet US there and minister [0 us: as we
draw
near t0 the throne of grace
we will "receive mercy and find grace
to help in time of need" (Heb. 4.16).
genuine worship we
will often experience an intensification of the sanctifying work of
the Holy Spirit, who is at work continually changing uS into the
likeness of Christ "from one
degree of glory to another" (2 Cor:
3.18).
The Lord' $ Enemies Flee.
When the people of Israel began to worship_
God at times would fight for them against their enemies. For example, when
the Moabites, Edomites_
and Syrians came against Judah, King Jehoshaphat
sent out the choir praising God in front of the army:
He appointed those who were t0
the LORD and praise him in
holy array; as they went before the army
And when they
sing and praise, the LORD set an ambush against the men of Ammon,
Moab
and Mount Seit; who had come against Judah, so that
were routed:
(2 Chron: 20.21-22)
Similarly; when God s people offer him worship today; we may expect that
During

demonic forces that oppose the gospel and cause
them t0 flee_
7. Unbelievers Know They Are in God' s Presence: Though Scripture does
not emphasize evangelism as
primary purpose when the church meets for
worship, Paul does tell the Corinthians to take thought for unbelievers and
outsiders who come t0 their services, t0 be sure that the Christians speak
understandable ways (see
Cor: 14.23). He also tells them that if the gift of
prophecy
functioning properly; unbelievers will from time
time have the
secrets of their heart disclosed, and they will fall on their face and
worship
God and declare that God is really among You
Cor: 14.25; cf: Acts 2.11).
But
evangelism is not seen as
primary purpose when the church assembles
for worship
and it would therefore not be right to have the only weekly
gathering of believers designed primarily with an
evangelistic
purpose. Paul'$
concern
rather that visitors understand what is going on (and not think that
Christians are "mad,
Cor: 14.23), and that they recognize that "God is
really among you-
Cor: 14.25).
Tha Etermal Value
Wlorthin
Because worship glorifies God and fulfills the purpose for which
God created uS, it is an activity of eternal significance and great
value_
When Paul cautions the Ephesians not (0 waste their time but
tO use it well; he puts it in the context of
as those who are
wise: "Look carefully then how you walk; not as unwise men but as
wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil" (Eph:
5.15-16).
Paul then explains what it is t0 be wise and t0 make the most of the
time:
Therefore do not be foolish_
but understand what the will of the Lord
And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be
filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your
heart, always and for everything giving thanks in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father: (Eph 5.17-20)
Therefore in the context of
time wisely and
the most of the
time,
Paul includes both
singing of spiritual psalms to one another and singing
[0 the Lord with our hearts.
This means that worship is doing the will of God! Worship

Moreover; because God is eternal and
omniscient; the praise that we give him will never fade from his
consciousness but will continue t0 bring delight to his heart for all
eternity (cf. Jude 25: "To the only God, our Savior through Jesus
Christ
ord_
be glory, majesty, dominion; and authority, before
all time and nOw and for ever"
The fact that worship
an activity of
significance and eternal
value is also evident in the fact that it is the primary activity carried
on by those who are already in heaven (cf: Rev 48-11; 5.11-14).
Enter Into Gemina Worshin?
Ultimately; worship is
spiritual activity and
must be empowered
by the Holy Spirit working within US
This means that
must pray
that the Holy Spirit will enable uS tO worship rightly
The fact that genuine worship is to be carried on in the unseen;
spiritua
realm is evident in Jesus
words:
The hour is coming; and nOw is, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father
spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks t0
worship him: God
spirit; and those who worship him must worship
in spirit and truth (John 4.23-24)
To worship "in spirit and truth" is best understood
mean not
the Holy Spirit;
but rather
in the spiritual realm, in the realm of
spiritual activity:
means that true worship involves nOt only
our physical bodies but also our spirits, the immaterial aspect of ur
existence that primarily acts in the unseen realm: Mary knew she
Was
worshiping in that way; for she exclaimed; "My soul magnifies
the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior" (Luke 1.46-47)_
We should realize also that God continually
seeks" (John 4.23)
those who will worship him in the spiritual realm and therefore
those whose spirit as well as body and mind is worshiping God
Such worship is nOt optional because those who worship God "must
worship in spirit and truth" (v 24)
Unless our spirits are
worshiping God we are not truly worshiping him:
An attitude of worship comes upon US when we begin t0 see God as
he is and then respond

Truly you are the Son of God'
(Matt: 14.33). The author
of Hebrews knows that when we come into the presence of God
(Heb.
12.18-24), the proper response is to "offer to God acceprable
worship, with reverence and awe; for our God is
consuming fire'
(Heb. 12.28-29). Therefore genuine worship is not something that
is self-generated or that can be worked up within ourselves. It must
rather be the outpouring of our hearts in response t0
realization of
who God is.
It is appropriate t0 ask whether there

heartfelt worship in our churches
In many evangelical churches
people do not truly worship God in their hearts until the last hymn_
after the sermon has focused their attention o who God is s0 that

But then;
just when heartfelt worship has begun; the service abruptly ends: It
should be just beginning
If genuine worship is lacking in our
churches

much more of the depth and richness of worship, which

natural response of the believing heart to
clear awareness of
God'$ presence and character:
there anything else we can do t0 make worship more effective?
We must remember that worship is
spiritual matter (John 4.21-
24), and the primary solutions will therefore be spiritual ones:
There will need to be much prayer in preparation for worship,
especially on the
ot those
leadership, asking that God will
bless the worship times and make himself known
Also
congregations will need
about the spiritual nature of
worship and the New Testament
understanding of worship in God's
presence (see Heb. 12.22-24). In addition, Christians need to be
encouraged t0 make right any broken interpersonal relationships.
Paul says that men are t0 lift holy hands
without anger or
quarreling
(1 Tim. 2.8) , and Jesus reminds uS that
are first
reconciled" to our brother; and then come before God' s altar
and offer
gift (Matt: 5.24). In
John says that anyone who
says; "[love God" but hates his brother "is

And the entire
church is responsible tO watch "that no
root of bitterness' spring up
and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled" (Heb. 12.15)
an indication that sin and broken relationships among
few can
spread t0 many and result in the withholding of God's blessing
from the whole congregation.
Moreover;
we are truly tO draw near to God in worship; there
must be
striving for personal holiness of life. The author of
Hebrews reminds believers
strive for "the holiness without which
no one will see the Lord" (Heb:
12.14) , and Jesus says that it is the
pure in hearr" who shall
see God" (Matc 5.8)
promise that is
fulfilled partially in this life and completely in the age to come.
Specifically in connection with prayer; John says_
"If our hearts do
condemn uS_
we have confidence before God"
John 3.21),
but this principle certainly applies to worship as well, as we have
boldness
come into God $ presence t0 offer him praise_
James
indicates
similar concern when, immediately after saying
Draw
near
God and he will draw near to you;
he adds_
"Cleanse your
hands_
you sinners, and purify your hearts, YOu men of double
mind" (James 4.8).
Yet the physical setting and the structure of worship services do
matter; for there are indications that Jesus thought that the
atmosphere of worship was very important: He
entered the temple
of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he
overtumed the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those
who sold pigeons.
In explanation of this action, Jesus insisted that
the temple was to be
house of prayer; for he said, "It is written;
My house shall be called
house of prayer
but you make it
den
of robbers'
(Matt: 21.12-13). He also told believers, "When you
pray; go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father
who is in secret" (Matt: 6.6), not only because in our rooms we will
not be seen by men, and will not pray So as t0 receive glory from
men; but also because the
knowledge
that others are
watching
uS in
ouI prayers S0 easily distracts our attention;
so that then we pray in
part
be heard by others or at least s0 as not to offend them. This
does not mean that corporate worship and prayer are forbidden (for
both are very evident in both the Old Testament and New
Testament), but it is to say that we should choose
setting for
prayer 0r for worship that avoids distractions as much as possible:
This is consistent with the fact that worship is t0 be done in an
orderly way; for
God is nOr
God of confusion but of peace'
Cor: 14.33; cf:
40). The atmosphere and mood of worship are
important; because we are t0

with reverence and awe
(Heb. 12.28). This means that it is

though the Psalms show that
both kinds of songs are pleasing
God:
In addition; it is important t0 allow enough time for the various
aspects of corporate worship_
Genuine prayer can certainly take
time (see Luke 6.12; 22.39-46; Acts 12.12; 13.2). Solid Bible
reaching can often take
long time as well (Matt: 15.32; Acts 20.7 -
11). Moreover; genuine, heartfelt worship and praise will also take
quite
bit of time if it is t0 be effective
This is true in
because different aspects of
worship service
require different attitudes and states of mind:
Listening
Bible
teaching requires attentiveness [0 the text and the teacher: Praise
requires joy and
focus on the Lord and his excellence: Prayers of
petition require
focus on needs and
concem for others.
Times when offerings are given require
focus on
sacrificing
ourselves t0 the Lord as well as giving to him from our means and
trusting him to provide for OuI needs. The Lord s
requires
time of reflection
self-examination
and perhaps repentance_
with thanksgiving: But we cannot have all of these attitudes at once,
for we are finite. Different attitudes of mind

impossible to fulfill all the tasks
necessary for an assembled

and it is harmful even t0 try: Those who do try to

If congregations are to fulfill the various purposes
for which God wants them

have extended times of reverent worship_
will probably need to
find creative solutions that enable them t0 meet for
longer periods
of time, and omit or reschedule some activities that have become
habitual or traditional on Sunday mornings but are really not
necessary:
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Do you experience genuine, fulfilling worship in YOur church each
Sunday? How much time is specifically allotted to worship (narrowly
defined)
tthat is, t0 times of praise and thanksgiving to God? Would you
like the time to be longer? What aspects of the worship time do you
most meaningful? Which aspects are least meaningful? How could your
church take steps
strengthen and deepen its experience of worship (if
that is needed)?
Have Yu ever felt
strong sense of the presence of God in corporate
worship? When was this? Can you describe it? Do you know what
factors contributed t0 this sense?
During times of worship; can you describe the emotions that are most
prominent in your consciousness? Is this experience similar t0 other
experiences in daily life, 0r are these feelings unique tO times of
worship? Have YOu ever sensed that God is ministering t0 YOu while You
are worshiping him? What made YOu aware of that?
Do you think there is enough genuine worship in a typical week in YOur
life? If not; what are the hindrances t0 such worship?
How do you feel about the fact that God is jealous for his own honor and
seeks his honor? Can you think of
anything in the universe that would be
more right than for God to seek his Own honor? Can you think of
anything other than worship of God that would make you feel more
deeply that you are doing the thing for which YOu were created?

Gifts of the Holy Spirit:
(Part 1)
General Questions
What are spiritual gifts? How many are there? Have some gifts
ceased? Seeking and using spiritual gifts:
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
Questione
Regarding Spiritual Gifts
General
In previous
generations, systematic theologies did not have chapters
on spiritual gifts, for there were few questions
regarding the nature
and use of spiritual gifts in the church. But the twentieth century
has seen
remarkable increase in interest in spiritual gifts,
primarily because of the influence of the Pentecostal and
charismatic movements within the church:
In this chapter
first look at some general questions regarding spiritual gifts, then
examine tne
specific question of whether some (miraculous) gifts
have ceased
In the next chapter we shall analyze the New
Testa
teaching about particular gifts
Before
beginning the discussion, however; we may define spiritual
gifts as follows:
spiritual gift is any ability that is empowered by
the Holy Spirit and used in any ministry of the church This broad
definition includes both gifts that are related to natural abilities
(such as
showing mercy; or administration) and gifts that
seem t0 be more
miraculous
and less related tO natural abilities
(such as prophecy; healing;
distinguishing between spirits). The
reason for this is that when Paul lists spiritual gifts (in Rom: 12.6
Cor: 7.7; 12.8-10,
28; and Eph: 411) he includes both kinds of
gifts_
Yet not every natural ability that people have is included here,
because Paul
clear that all spiritual gifts must be empowered "by
one and the same Spirit"
Cor: 12.11) , that
are given "for the
common
(1 Cor: 12.7) , and that they are all to be used for
edification'
(1 Cor: 14.26), or for
up the church:

was ar work in the Old Testament;
people to faith and working in
remarkable ways in
few individuals such as Moses or Samuel, David or
Elijah But in general there was less powerful activity of the
Spirit in the
lives of most believers.
Effective
evangelism of the nations had been
diminished, casting out of demons
was unknown, miraculous
healing was
uncommon (though it did happen; especially in the ministries of Elijah and
Elisha) , prophecy was restricted t0
few prophets or small bands of prophets_
and
resurection
over sin in the sense of Romans 6.1-14 and
Philippians 3:10 was rarely experienced
But at severa
points the Old Testament looks forward t0
time
there would be
greater empowering of the Holy Spirit that
would reach t0 all of God's people
Moses said,
Would that all the
LORD
people were prophets_
that the LORD would put his spirit
upon them!" (Num: 11.29).
And the LORD prophesied through Joel:
And
shall come
pass afterward,
that
will pour ut my spirit on all flesh;
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy;
your old men shall dream dreams_
and your young men shall see visions.
Even upon the menservants and maidservants
in those days,
will pour out my spirit: (Joel 2.28-29)
John the Baptist heightens people'$ expectations of the fulfillment of Joel'$
prophecy when he announces that someone
after him who "will
baptize YOu with the Holy Spirit and
fire
(Matt %1l; cf. Mark 1.8;
Luke 3.16; John 1.33; Acts 1.5).
When Jesus begins his ministry he comes bringing the fullness and
power of the
Spirit in his person: Luke writes_
And Jesus
returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee'
(Luke 4.14). The
result is that he teaches with great power (Luke 4.15-22) and he
heals and casts out demons from all who are oppressed (Luke 4.31-
41). Clearly; Jesus has come in the greater new covenant power of
the Holy Spirit; and he has come t0 conquer Satan
kingdom:
bringing
Holy
power"
when
coming
with
Holy
he says that the power of the Holy Spirit at work in him
enabling him t0 cast Out demons is an indication that the kingdom
of God has come in power: "If it is by the Spirit of God that
cast
out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt.
12.28). Looking back on Jesus' life and ministry; John tells us,
The
reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the
devil" (1 John 3.8).
But this new covenant power of the Holy Spirit is not limited to the
ministry of Jesus alone: He sent his disciples out, saying; "The
kingdom of heaven is at hand" and told them
"Heal the sick; raise
the dead, cleanse lepers_
cast out demons" (Matt: 10.7-8).
Nevertheless, this new covenant power of the Holy Spirit is nOt yet
distributed t0 all who believed in Jesus or followed him; but only
his twelve disciples or to the seventy disciples (Luke 10.1-12).
The pouring out of the Holy Spirit in new covenant fullness and
power in the church occurred at Pentecost Before Jesus ascended
into heaven he commanded his apostles
not [0
depart from
Jerusa
but
wait for the promise of the Father;
and the
content of that promise was; "Before many days You shall be
baptized with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 1.4-5). He promised them;
"You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you
(Acts 1.8). When the Spirit was poured out on the church at
Pentecost Peter recognized that Joel's prophecy was being fulfilled_
for he said, "this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel" (Acts
2.16), and he then quoted Joel $ prophecy (vv: 17-21).
recognized that the new

empowering of the Holy Spirit
had come t0 God'$ people and the new covenant age had
begun as
direct result of the activity of Jesus in heaven, for Peter said,
This Jesus God raised Up, and of that we are all witnesses. Being
therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from
the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit; he has poured OUt this
which YOu see and hear: (Acts 2.32-33)
Against the background of Jesus' ministry and the earlier ministry
of the disciples with Jesus, the disciples present at Pentecost would
have expected that powerful
evangelistic preaching

and
perhaps also prophecy; dreams, and visions would all
begin and
continue among those who believe in Christ, and that these things

would be characteristic of the new covenant age that began at
Pentecost
further characteristic of this outpouring of the Holy
Spirit was
widespread distribution of spiritual gifts to all people
sons and daughters, young men and old men, menservants and
maidservants
in the words of Joel
all received
new covenant
empowering of the Holy Spirit, and
would also be expected that
all would receive gifts of the Holy Spirit then as well_
that
is what happened in the early church (see
Cor: 12-14; Gal 3.5;
James 5.14-15). As B_
B. Warfield said:
We are justified in
considering
characteristic of the Apostolic
churches that such miraculous gifts should be displayed
them. The
exception would be, not
church with, but
church without, such
gifts _
The Apostolic Church was characteristically
miracle -
working church:
(This is true
regardless of what view one takes about the continuation of
miraculous gifts after the time of the apostles:)
2. The Purpose of Spiritual Gifts in the New Testament Age: Spiritual gifts
are given t0 equip the church t0 carry out its ministry until Christ returns
Paul tells the Corinthians
You
not lacking in any spiritual gift; as you
wait for tne revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ
Cor: 1.7) . Here he
connects the
possession of spiritual gifts and their situation in the history of
redemption (waiting for Christ' $ retum), suggesting that gifts are given tO the
church for the period berween Christ $ ascension and his return. Similarly;
Paul looks forward tO the time of Christ'$ return and says, "When the perfect
comes
the
imperfect will pass away" (1 Cor: 13:10), indicating also that these
"imperfect" gifts (mentioned in vv: 8-9)
be in operation until Christ
returns
when they will be superseded by
something far greater:
Indeed
the
pouring out of the Holy Spirit in "power" at Pentecost (Acts 1:8) was to equip
the church
preach the gospel
(Acts 1.8)
-something that
continue until
Christ returns_
And Paul reminds believers that
their use of spiritual gifts
they are to
strive [0 excel
building up the church" (1Cor: 14.12). Finally;
to the Ephesians_
Paul specifies that when Christ ascended into
heaven he gave gifts "to equip the saints for the work of ministry; for building
up the body of Christ" (Eph: 4.12).
But spiritual gifts not only
the church for the time until Christ
returns, they also give
foretaste of the age
come. Paul reminds
the Corinthians that they were
enriched" in all their speech and all
facl,
Ore
will
will
writing `
equip
their knowledge, and that the result of this
enriching ~
was that
were
not lacking in any spiritual gift" (1 Cor: 1:5, 7). Of course,
this enrichment in their speech and knowledge did not give them
the perfect speech or the perfect knowledge that would be theirs in
heaven; but only
foretaste or down payment of that heavenly
perfection. Similarly, Paul reminds the Corinthians that spiritual
gifts are "imperfect" but when the
perfect" way of knowing comes
at the Lord $ retum; then these gifts will pass away (1 Cor: 13.10)
Just as the Holy Spirit himself is in this age
"down payment"
Cor: 1.22 NASB mg_
cf. 2 Cor: 5.5; Eph: 1:14) of the fuller work
of the Holy Spirit within US in the age tO come, s0 the gifts the Holy
Spirit gives uS are partial foretastes of the fuller
working of the
Holy Spirit that :-
be OuIs in the age
come.
In this way; gifts of insight and discernment prefigure the much
greater discernment we will have when Christ returns. Gifts of
knowledge and wisdom prefigure the much greater wisdom that
will be ours when we "know as we are known
(cf:
Cor: 13.12).
Gifts of
give
foretaste of the perfect health that will be
ours when Christ grants to US resurrection bodies. Similar parallels
could be found with all the New Testament
Even the diversity
of gifts should lead to greater unity and interdependence in the
church (see
Cor: 12.12-13,24-25; Eph. 413), and this diversity
unity will itself be
foretaste of the unity that believers will have
in heaven:
3. How Many Gifts Are There? The New Testament epistles list specific
spiritual gifts in six different passages_
Consider the table on the next page_
What is obvious is that these lists are all
different No one list
has all these gifts_
and no gift except prophecy is mentioned on all
the lists (prophecy is not mentioned in
Cor: 7.7
where only the
subject of
and celibacy is under discussion, but it is
certainly included in the
whoever speaks
Peter 4.11). In
Corinthians 7:7 mentions LWO gifts that are not on any other list:
in the context of
speaking of marriage and celibacy; Paul says
"Each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one
of another:"
These facts indicate that Paul was not attempting t0 construct
exhaustive lists of gifts when he specified the ones he did. Although
there

facl,

and teachers third, but tongues last in

Moreover; there is some
degree of overlap among the
listed at
various places_
No doubt the gift of administration (kybernesis,
Cor: 12.28) is similar tO the gift of leadership (ho proistamenos,
Rom: 12.8) , and both terms could probably be applied t0 many who
have the office of pastor-teacher (Eph 411) Moreover; in some
cases Paul lists an activity and in other cases lists the related noun
that describes the person (such as
prophecy" in Rom: 12.6 and
Cor: 12.10, but "propher" in
Cor: 12.28 and Eph: 411).
Another reason for
that Paul could have made much longer
lists if he had wanted tO is the fact that some of the gifts listed will
have many different expressions as they are found in different
people. Certainly the gift of serving (Rom_
12.6) or helps
Cor:
12.28) will take many different forms in different situations and
among different people. Some may serve or help by giving wise
counse_
others by cooking meals
others by caring for children or
befriending
older person, others by giving specialized legal or
first;
enalkd
gifts _
thinking
medical or financial
advice when needed within the church: These
differ greatly. Among those who possess the gift of
evangelism, some will be good at personal evangelism within
neighborhood, others at
evangelism through
of tracts and
Christian literature; and others at evangelism through large
campaigns and public meetings. Still others will be
evangelism through radio and television. Not all of these
evangelistic gifts are the same
even
though
fall under the
broad category of "evangelism
The same could be said about gifts
of teaching or administration:
All of this simply means that no
Lwo people'$ gifts are exactly alike:
How many different gifts are there then? It simply depends on how
specific we wish to be_
We can make
very short list of only tWO
gifts as Peter does in
Peter 4.11: "whoever
and "whoever
renders service:
In this list of only two
items Peter includes all the
gifts mentioned in any other list because all of them fit in one of
these [WO
categories.
On the other hand, we could take the Old
Testa
offices of prophet, priest, and king; and have
list of
three kinds of gifts: prophetic gifts (in this broad sense)
include
anything that involves teaching, encouraging; exhorting;
rebuking others. Priestly gifts would include anything that involves
showing mercy and care for those in need Or involve interceding
before God (such as praying in tongues) The kingly gifts would
involve anything having to do with administration or government or
order
the church
Other classifications of gifts are gifts of knowledge (such as
distinguishing between spirits,
word of wisdom, and word of
knowledge), gifts of power (such as healing, miracles, and faith) ,
and gifts of speech (tongues; interpretation
and prophecy)
Then
again we could make
much
longer list; such as the list of twenty-
LWO gifts enumerated above_
But even that list does not include all
the possible gifts (no list includes
gift of intercessory prayer; for
instance_
which may be related to
gift of faith but is not the same
gift of faith; no musical gifts are included on any list either; and
neither is any gift of casting Out demons
even though Paul must
have known that some Christians were more effective in that area
than others) And if we wished to divide up different kinds of
service Or administration Or evangelism Or [eaching-
then we could
quite easily have
list that included fifty
Or' even
hundred items.

The point of all of this is simply tO say that God gives the church an
amazing variety of spiritual gifts_
and they are all tokens of his
varied grace. In fact; Peter says as much:
As each has received
gift, employ it for one another; as
stewards of God $ varied
grace
Peter 4.10; the word
varied" here is poikilos, which
means "having many facets or aspects; having rich diversity
The practical outcome of this discussion is that we should be
willing
recognize and appreciate people who have gifts that
differ from ours and whose gifts may differ from Our expectations
of what certain gifts should look like: Moreover;
healthy church
will have
great diversity of gifts, and this diversity should not lead
fragmentation but tO greater unity among believers in the church:
Paul*$ whole point in the analogy of the body with many members
Cor: 12.12-26) is t0 say that God has put us in the body with
these differences so that we might depend
each other:
The eye
cannot say
the hand;
have no need of YOU,
nor
the head
t0 the
have no need of you:
On the contrary; the parts of the
body which seem to be weaker are indispensable" (1 Cor: 12.21-
22; cf:
4-6). It runs counter t0 the world'$ way of thinking to
say that we will enjoy greater unity when we join closely together
with those who are different from uS
but that is precisely the point
that Paul makes in
Corinthians 12, demonstrating the glory of
God's wisdom in not allowing anyone
have all the necessary
gifts for the church, but in
requiring us to depend upon each other
for the proper functioning of the church
Gifts May
in Strength: Paul says that if we have the gift of
prophecy; we should use it "in proportion t0 our faith
(Rom: 12.6),
indicating that the gift can be more or less strongly developed in different
individuals
or' in the same individual over
period of time: This is why Paul
can remind
Timothy; "Do not neglect the gift you have
(1 Tim_
4.14),and
can say;
remind You t0 rekindle the
gift of God that is within you" (2 Tim.
1:6).
was possible for Timothy to allow his gift tO weaken, apparently
through infrequent use_
and Paul reminds him tO stir it up by using
and
thereby strengthening it. This should not be surprising; for we realize that
many gifts increase in strength and effectiveness as
are used_
whether
evangelism, teaching; encouraging; administration; or faith. Apollos had
strong gift of preaching and teaching_
for we read that he was "mighty (Or
powerful,
Gk: dynatos) in the Scriptures" (Acts 18.24 NASB) And Paul
apparently had
trequently used and
effective gift of speaking in
tongues because he says,
thank God thal
speak in tongues more than You

very
all" (1 Cor: 14.18).
All of these texts indicate that spiritual gifts may vary in strength If
we think of any gift, whether teaching or
evangelism
0n the one
hand;
prophecy or healing on the other; we should realize that
within any congregation there will likely be people who are
effective in the use of that gift (perhaps through
and
experience) , others who are moderately strong in that gift, and
others who probably have the gift but are just beginning t0 use it:
This variation in strength in spiritual gifts depends on
combination of divine and human influence_
The divine influence is
the sovereign working of the Holy Spirit as he
apportions t0 each
one individually as he wills" (1 Cor: 12:11). The human influence
comes from
experience,
wisdom, and natural ability in the
use of that gift: It is usually not possible to know in what proportion
the divine and human influences combine at any one time; nor is it
really necessary to know; for even the abilities we think to be
natural" are from God (1 Cor: 4.7) and under his sovereign control
(see chapter 16 on God $ providence and human
responsibility).
But this leads t0 an
interesting question: how strong does an ability
have to be before it can be called
spiritual gift? How much
teaching ability does someone need before he or she could be said
have
of teaching_
for example? Or how effective in
evangelism would someone need to be before we would
recognize
gift of evangelism? Or how frequently would someone have to see
prayers for healing answered before he or she could be said to have
gift of healing?
Scripture does not directly answer this question; but the fact that
Paul speaks of these gifts as useful for the building up of the church
Cor: 14.12), and the fact that Peter likewise says that each person
who has received
gift should remember to employ it "for one
another"
Peter 4.10), suggest that both Paul and Peter thought of
gifts as abilities that were strong enough t0 function for the benefit
of the church; whether for the assembled congregation (as in
prophecy
teaching),
for individuals at various times in the
congregation (as helps or encouragement)
Probably no definite line can be drawn in this matter; but Paul does
remind us that not all have every gift or any one gift: He is quite
clear in this in
set of questions that expect the answer no at each
very
long
taining;
gift =
point:
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all
work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with
tongues? Do all interpret?" (1 Cor: 12.29-30). The Greek text (with
the particle me before each question) clearly expects the answer no
tO every question. Therefore; not all are teachers, for example;
do all possess gifts of healing_
nor do all speak in tongues_
But even though not all have the
gift of teaching; it is true that all
people "teach" in some sense of the word teach:
Even people who
would never dream of teaching
Sunday school class
read
Bible stories tO their own children and explain the meaning to them
-indeed, Moses commanded the Israelites to do this very
with their children (Deut: 6.7), explaining God*$ words to them as
they sat in their house 0r walked on the road: So we must say on the
one hand that not everyone has the gift of
teaching: But on the other
hand
must say that there is some general ability related
the
gift of teaching that all Christians have_
Another way of saying this
would be tO say that there is no spiritual gift that all believers have,
yet there is some general ability similar to every
gift that all
Christians have_
We can see this with
number of gifts Not all Christians have
gift of evangelism; but all Christians have the ability to share the
gospel with their neighbors. Not all Christians have gifts of healing
(in fact; as we shall see below; some people say that no one today
has genuine gifts of healing
but nevertheless every Christian can
and does pray tor God t0 healy
friends 0r relatives who are ill
Not
every Christian has the gift of faith, but every believer has some
degree of faith, and we would expect it to be
growing in the life of
ordinary Christian.
We can even say that other
gifts, such as prophecy and speaking in
tongues, not only vary in strength among those who have the gift
but also find
counterpart in some general abilities that are found
in the life of
Christian. For example, if we understand
prophecy (according to the definition given in chapter 53)
to be
"reporting something that God spontaneously

then
it is true that not everyone experiences this as
gift, for not
everyone experiences God spontaneously bringing

We can even consider the gift of speaking
rongues
this
perspective_
If we think of speaking in tongues as prayer in
syllables not understood by the speaker (see
Cor: 14.2, 14) ,
then
it is true that not every Christian has the gift of speaking
tongues
(and once
must be said that some Christians would argue
that no one has that gift today; since the age of the apostles has
ended) But on the other hand
must recognize that every
Christian has times of prayer in which his 0r her prayer is expressed
not only in intelligible words and syllables_
but also in terms of
sighs_
groans
or weeping that we know is understood and heard by
the Lord_
and that expresses needs and concerns of 0ur hearts that
we cannot fully put into words (cf. Rom
8.26-27). Once
should not call this
gift of speaking in tongues
but it does seem
general ability in our Christian lives that is somewhat related to
the gift of speaking in tongues, in that it gives expression to prayer
syllables that we do not fully understand, but that the Holy Spirit
nonetheless makes into effective prayer that is heard by God:
The point of this whole discussion is simply to say that spiritual
gifts are not as mysterious and
other worldly" as people sometimes
make them out [0 be_
Many of them are only intensifications or
highly developed instances of phenomena that most Christians
experience
their own lives:
The other important point t0 be
drawn from this discussion is that even though we have been given
gifts by God, we are still responsible tO use them effectively, and to
seek t0 grow in their use that the church may receive more benefit
from the gifts of which God has allowed us to be stewards_
Finally; the fact that gifts may vary in strength allows US to
recognize thal
certain person'
gift (such as teaching or
administration, for example) may not be strong enough tO function
for the benefit of the entire church in

5. Do Christians Possess Gifts Temporarily or Permanently? In most
cases_
seems that the New 'lestament pictures
permanent possession of
spiritual gifts
The analogy of the parts of the body in
Corinthians 12.12-26
fits this
in that the eye does not become
hand
nor does the ear become
foot; but various parts exist in the body permanently
Moreover; Paul says
that some people have titles that describe
continuing function. Some people
can be called "prophets
"teachers'
Cor: 12.29) 0r
evangelists
(Eph:
4.11) . We would expect that those people have
permanent possession of the
gifts of prophecy; teaching_
and
evangelism, unless some unusual
circumstance would come
which would take that gift away Similarly;
Paul talks in terms of possessing spiritual
when he says; "If
have the
gift of prophecy
Cor: 13.2 NIV) And when Paul requires that there be an
interpreter present for anyone t0 speak in tongues
Cor: 14.28), he assumes
that the church will know whether someone who has the
gift of interpretation
is present, which implies that that gift would be possessed by someone over
time: When he says
"If any one thinks that he is
prophet"
Cor: 14.37), he
realizes that some at Corinth will have functioned with the
gift of prophecy
frequently enough to think of themselves as
prophets
All of these verses
point in the direction of
permanent;
at least
abiding and continuing;
possession of spiritual gifts
Indeed
in Romans 12
Paul begins his sentence
Having gifts thar
differ according to the grace given t0 Us
(Rom. 12.6).
And he tells
Timothy; "Do not neglect the gift that is in YOU
Tin: 4.14,
literal translation) , again indicating that Timothy had had that gift
over
period of time.
Therefore
seems that in
general the New
Testament indicates that people have spiritual gifts given to them
and, once they have them; they are usually able
continue
use
them over the course of their Christian life.
However; some important qualifications must be made; because
there are some senses in which
gifts are not permanent There are
some
gifts that are nonpermanent by their very nature, such as the
gifts of marriage and celibacy
Cor:
Though Paul calls them
gifts_
in the lives of most believers there will be times at which they

are unmarried, and times
which
are married: Moreover;
some
though perhaps exercised fairly frequently, still cannot
be exercised at will. Effectiveness in the gift of healing
example, depends on God $ sovereign will in answering prayer for
healing: Similarly, prophecy depends on the giving of
spontaneous "revelation" (1 Cor: 14.30) from God_
and simply
cannot be exercised at will. The same could even be said about the
gift of evangelism: It is ultimately the work of the Holy Spirit to
bring regeneration and enable someone to believe, so the
evangelist
may pray and preach, but only God can give the harvest of souls:
In other cases_
some
particular gift may be given for
unique need
event: Though it is not, strictly speaking_
spiritual gift in the
Testament sense, the return of Samson'
strength one
ast time
at the end of his life (Judg: 16.28) was given temporarily for one
final moment in his life_
And, in the New Testament; the
remarkable revelation of heaven
Stephen had when he; "full of the
Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7.55) was
manifestation
of the Spirit given to him only for that
moment:
Another sense in which
gift may be non-permanent is if a person
neglects his or her gift, and perhaps grieves the Holy Spirit or falls
into serious doctrinal or moral error (as Samson did in the Old
Testament; for example). In such
case the gift may be withdrawn
Certainly Paul warned Timothy; "Do not neglect the gift you have
Tim_
4.14), and we may perhaps also learn from the parable of
the talents,
which Jesus says that
every one who has will
more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has
not, even what he has
be taken away'
(Matt_ 25.29)
Moreover; we must remember that the Holy Spirit is still sovereign
distributing gifts: he
apportions t0 each one individually as he
wills
(1 Cor: 12.11). The word here translated
apportions'
present participle_
which indicates continuing activity over time,
and we could paraphrase,
The Holy Spirit is always continuing to
distribute or apportion gifts t each person individually just as he
wills t0 do.
This means that, although it is ordinarily the custom of
the Holy Spirit t0 continue tO empower the same gift Or gifts in
people over time, nonetheless

Finally;
Corinthians 13.8-13 (t0 be discussed below) indicates
that the present spiritual gifts which we have are only for this age,
and will be superseded by something far greater: Therefore in that
sense n0
gift is "permanent" since every gift will be rendered
useless at the time of the Lord $ return
Within this discussion of the question of whether spiritual gifts are
temporary Or
permanent, sometimes Romans 11.29
mentioned:
"For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable:
It does not seem
to be appropriate tO use the verse in the context of this
discussion;
however; for in this case Paul is
talking about the status of the
Jewish people, including their calling as God*$ people and the gifts
blessings bestowed on them as
result of that status . Here Paul is
arguing that God still has
purpose for his people Israel; but the
question of gifts of the Holy Spirit in the sense of
Corinthians 12_
14is not in view at all in Romans 11.29_
And certainly in any case
this sentence would not be true as
totally unrestricted statement
concerning spiritual gifts
for it is evident that through misuse
neglect; or grieving of the Holy Spirit;
can have their gifts
diminished or removed by God's sovereign choice.
Are Gifts Miraculous or Nonmiraculous? The answer t0 this question
really
depends on the definition of the word miracle.
If we define miracle as
direct activity of God in the world,
then all the spiritual gifts are
miraculous because they are all empowered by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor: 12.11;
cE vv. 4-6). But in that sense everything that happens in the world might be
said t0 be miraculous
because all of it is brought about by God's providential
work in creation (see Eph:
1:11; Dan. 4.35; Matt 5.45).
Therefore the word
miracle loses its usefulness
because
is difficult for us to find something
that happens in the world that is not miraculous in this sense:
is better t0 define miracle in
narrower sense_
as we did in
chapter 17, above:
miracle is
"less common activity of God in
which he arouses people's awe and wonder and bears witness t0
himself:
terms of this definition; only some gifts are
"miraculous'
namely, those
that people think to be miraculous
because
are amazed at the activity of God operating in them
Certainly we would include in this category prophecy (note the
amazement of the unbeliever in
Cor: 14.24-25), healing
people
gifts _

(similarly; note the response of people in Acts 3.10 et al.)
out of demons (see Acts 19.11-13, 17), or speaking in tongues
when it is an actual foreign language and understood by others (see
the description of Pentecost in Acts 2.7). Probably other remarkable
phenomena would be included in the
ot miracles
Cor: 12.10)
as well:
On the other hand, in this definition;
some
gifts would be thought of
as nonmiraculous. Gifts of serving; teaching; encouraging
contributing; and doing acts of mercy (in Rom: 12:7-
8) would fall
in this category; as would the gifts of those who act as helpers and
administrators (1 Cor: 12.28)_
But it is still the same Holy Spirit
who gives them and works through them
The point of this anab
is [0 caution uS
supernaturalnatural
distinction in our minds whereby we think that
some gifts are "supernatural" and some gifts are simply
natural.
The Bible makes no such distinction
and the
danger of
this is
that we may tend t0 think that some gifts (which we think to be
superatural"
are more important 0r more clearly from the Lord,
and we may tend t0 devalue Or deemphasize the gifts which we
think t0 be
natural:
If we do this we will fail t0 see God's hand in
the working of all the gifts and fail to thank him for all of them:
On the other hand_
the misleading supernatural/natural distinction
could also cause US t0 be very suspicious about those which we
think to be "supernatural;
0r' could lead uS t0 think that
are
very unlikely to happen in Our Own experience. In that case
would tend tO emphasize the gifts we thought to be
natural" and
have
very low degree of expectation or faith
regarding anything
which
thought to be
supernatural:
In contrast to this perspective, Scripture says that
all" the gifts are
worked in us by the same Holy Spirit; the same Lord, and the same
God
Cor: 12.4-6). The worldview of Scripture is one of
continuity and continua
interaction between the visible world that
we can see and touch and the invisible world that Scripture tells uS
is there and is real. God works in both, and we do ourselves and the
church
great disservice by separating these aspects of creation
into
supernatural" and
natural:-
Finally; should we seek the more unusual or miraculous gifts_
casting

lysis

should we seek the more
ordinary gifts? Once again, Scripture does
not make this kind of distinction when it tells us what kind of gifts
seek: Paul says t0 the Corinthians, "Since yOu are eager for
manifestations of the Spirit; strive to excel in building up the
church
(1 Cor: 14.12). This means that we should learn which
gifts are most needed in the church we attend, and then pray that
God would give those gifts tO ourselves Or to others_
Whether those
gifts are thought to be miraculous O non-miraculous really is not
the important point at all
Discovering and
Spiritual Gifts: Paul seems t0 assume that
believers will know what their spiritual gifts are
He simply tells those in the
church at Rome to use their gifts in various ways: "if prophecy; in proportion
[0 our faith
he who contributes
in liberality=
he who gives aid, with zeal;
he who does acts of mercy; with cheerfulness" (Rom: 12.6-8) . Similarly;
Peter simply tells his readers how t0 use their gifts
but does nOt say
anything
about discovering what they are:
As each has received
gift; employ
one another; as good stewards of God $ varied grace
(1 Peter 4.10).
But what if many members in
church do not know what spiritual
gift or gifts God has given tO them? In such
case , the leaders of
the church need to ask whether they are providing sufficient
opportunities for varieties of gifts to be used. Though the lists of
gifts given in the New Testament are not exhaustive
certainly
provide
starting point for churches t0 ask whether at least
there
opportunity for these gifts to be used. If God has placed
people with certain gifts in
church when these gifts are not
encouraged
perhaps not allowed to be used_
they will feel
frustrated and unfulfilled in their Christian ministries
and will
perhaps move
another church where their gifts can function for
the benefit of the church:
In the case of individuals who do not know what their gifts are,
can begin by asking what the needs and opportunities for ministry
are in their church:
Specifically; they can ask what gifts are most
needed for the
up of the church at that point: In addition
each individual believer who does not know what his or her gifts
should do some self-examination:
What interests and desires
and abilities does he or she have? Can others give advice or
encouragement pointing in the direction of specific gifts?
Moreover; has there been blessing
the past in ministering in
particular kind
service? In all of this, the person seeking

discover his or her gifts should pray and ask God for wisdom;
confident that it will be given according to his promise; "If any of
you lacks wisdom; let him ask God, who gives to all men
generously and without reproaching_
and it will be given him. But
let him ask in faith; with no doubting"
(James 1.5-6). Sometimes
God will

own abilities_
At other times
may come through advice
from others or through seeing increased blessing in one area of
ministry. And Paul indicates that in some cases there may be
prophecy that gives indication of
specific gift; for he says to
Timothy; "Do not neglect the gift you have_
which was given you
through prophecy with the laying on of hands of the council of
elders'
4.14,author"
translation).
Finally; the person
wondering what his or her spiritual gifts are
should simply begin
try ministering
various areas and see
where God brings blessing: Teaching
Sunday school class or
home Bible study is an excellent way to
begin
the
gift of
teaching: Every community has opportunities for greater use of the
gift of evangelism. People who think they may have _

healing could ask their elders for opportunities
accompany them
when they g0 t0 pray for the sick: People who think
may have
gift of faith or .
gift of intercessory prayer could begin to ask
some Christian friends for specific needs about which t0 pray. In all
of this, churches can give encouragement and opportunities for
people to try out
various gifts, and can also give
and
practical training in the proper methods of using various gifts. In
addition_
churches should continually be praying that God would
allow people to find what their gifts are and then to be able t0 use
them.
In all of this the
is that the body of Christ in each
ocation grow up
maturity, until "the whole body; joined and knit
together by every joint with which it is supplied
when each part is
working properly; makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love"
(Eph. 4.16).
Beyond the question of discovering what gifts one has
the
question of seeking additional spiritual gifts_
Paul commands
Christians,
Earnestly desire the higher
(1 Cor: 12.31), and
says later; "Make love
aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual
gifts, especially that You may prophesy'
(1 Cor: 14.1). In this
context, Paul defines what he means by "higher
or "greater
gifts
because in
Corinthians 14.5 he repeats the word he used in
grant
Tin
using
they
using
teaching
goal
gifts '
Your
Bifts"
12.31 for "higher" (Gk meizon) when he says_
He who prophesies
is greater than he who speaks in tongues
unless someone
interprets, So that the church may be edified" (1 Cor: 14.5). Here
the "greater" gifts are those that most edify the church. This is
consistent with Paul'
statement
few verses later; when he says_
since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive [0 excel
building up the church" (1 Cor: 14:12) The higher gifts are those
that build up the church more and bring more benefit [0 Others.
But how do we seek more spiritual gifts? FirSt; we should ask God
for them: Paul says directly that
he who
tongue should
pray for the power t0 interpret-
Cor: 14.13; cf: James 1.5,
where
James tells people that they should ask God for wisdom). Next;
people who seek additional spiritual gifts should have right motives.
If spiritual gifts are sought only so that the person may be more
prominent or have more
or power; this certainly
wrong
God $ eyes- This was the motivation of Simon the Sorcerer in
Acts 8.19
when he said, "Give me also this power; that any one on
whom
my hands may receive the Holy Spirit" (see Peter'$
rebuke in vv 21-22). Similarly; Ananias and Sapphira sought glory
for themselves when they purported to be giving the entire proceeds
of the sale of their land t0 the church, but
was not true, and both
lost their lives (Acts 5.1-11). It is
fearful thing tO want spiritual
gifts Or prominence in the church only for our Own glory; not for the
glory of God and for the help of others_
Therefore those who seek
spiritual gifts must first ask if they are
them out of love for
others and
concem t0 be able t0 minister t0 their needs, because
those who have great spiritual gifts but "have not love
are
in God's sight (cf:
Cor: 13.1-3). This is why Paul says
Make love your aim;
and only after that adds_
and eamestly
desire the spiritua_
gifts"
Cor: 14.1). He repeats the same theme
again when he says_
"since YOu are eager for manifestations of the
Spirit; strive t0 excel in building up the church" (1 Cor: 14.12).
Every person asking God for an additional spiritual gift should
search his or her Own heart frequently; asking why this particular
gift is desired. Is it really out of
love for others and
desire t0
build up the church and to see God glorified?
After that, it is appropriate tO seek opportunities to try the gift; just
as in the case of
person
to discover his or her gift, as
explained above. Small group Bible studies Or prayer meetings in
homes often provide
setting in which people can try gifts of

healing; for example.
Finally; those who are
additional spiritual gifts should
continue t0 uSe the
gifts they now have, and should be content if
God chooses not to give them more. The master approved of the
servant whose pound had
made ten pounds more,
but condemned
the one who hid his pound in
napkin and did
with it (Luke
19.16-17,20-23)
certainly showing US that we have
responsibility
use and attempt t0 increase whatever talents or
abilities God has given tO 4S as his stewards_
To balance this emphasis on seeking and growing in spiritual
we must also remember
that Paul clearly says that spiritual gifts are
apportioned t0 each person individually by the Holy Spirit
as ne
wills
(1 Cor: 12:11), and that "God arranged the organs in the
body; each one of them_
as he chose
(1 Cor: 12.18) . He says that
God has put various gifts in the church and not all are apostles Or
prophets or teachers
Cor: 12.28-30). In this way he reminds the
Corinthians that ultimately the distribution of gifts is
matter of
God's sovereign will, and it is for the
of the church and for
our good that none of us have all of the gifts, and that we will need
continually t0 depend on others who have
gifts differing from ourS_
These considerations should make uS content if God chooses not to
give uS the other gifts that we seek:
8. Gifts Are Tools for Ministry, and Not Necessarily Related to Christian
Maturity: We must recognize that spiritual gifts are given to
believer ( 1
Cor: 12.7,
Peter 4.10). Even immature Christians receive spiritual gifts
from the Lord
this was certainly evident in the Corinthian church; which
had an abundance of spiritual
(1 Cor: 1.7), but was still very immature in
many areas of doctrine and conduct. Paul says, "But
brethren
could nOr
address yOu as spiritual men
but as men of the flesh; as babes in Christ"
Cor: 3.1). So spiritual gifts are not necessarily
sign of spiritual maturity. It is
possible to have remarkable spiritual gifts in one area or another but still be
immature in doctrinal
understanding
or in Christian conduct; as was the
case at Corinth Indeed_
on occasion even unbelievers are able t0 prophesy
and cast out demons and do miracles, for Jesus says that at the last day many
will say t0 him_
Lord,
Lord, did we not prophesy in your name
and cast out
demons in VOuI name
and do many mighty works in your name?" But Jesus
will declare t0 them;
never knew you; depart from me_

performed many remarkable works: So we must not evaluate spiritual
maturity on the basis of spiritual gifting: Maturity comes through
close walk
with Jesus, and results in obedience to his commands in everyday life: "He
who says he abides in him ought tO walk in the same way in which he
walked"
John 2.6).
Why then does the Holy Spirit give us spiritual gifts? They are
given for the work of ministy and are simply tools t0 be used fOr
that end_
should never be
source ot personal pride on the
part of those who possess them, nor should
be thought of as
mark of maturity. We should strive simply t0 excel
in loving others _
caring for their needs, building up the church; and living
conformity to the pattern of Christ'$ life. If we do that, and if God
chooses t0 give US spiritual gifts that equip us for those tasks, then
should thank him for that; and pray that he would keep us from
pride over gifts that have been freely and graciously given, and
which we did not earn:

This passage is important tO the discussion because in it Paul
mentions the gift of prophecy as something that is "imperfect;
and
then says that what is "imperfect" will

He even says when this will happen:
when the perfect comes.
But

mean that Paul had in mind something that would answer this

the church

gifts in proper perspective. It is not enough simply to
seek the greater gifts" (12.3la, author
translation).
One must also
seek
after love
(14.1
author'$ translation) , thus coupling proper goals with proper
motives.
Without love, the gifts are without value (13.1-3). In fact, Paul
argues, love is superior t0 all the gifts and therefore
iS more important [0 act
in love than
have any of the gifts.
In order to show the superiority of love, Paul argues that it lasts
forever, whereas the gifts are all temporary (13.8)
Verses 9-12
further explain why the gifts are temporary Our present
knowledge
and prophesying are partial
and imperfect (v 9), but someday
something perfect will come to replace them
10). This is
explained by the analogy of
child who gives up childish thought
and speech for the thought and speech of an adult (v 11). Paul then
dimly;
age?
elaborates further on verses 9-10 by explaining that our present
perception and knowledge are indirect and imperfect; but that
someday they will be direct and perfect (v 12).
In this argument Paul connects the function of prophecy with the
time of its cessation. It fills
certain need now; but does S0 only
imperfectly When "the perfect" comes, that function will be better
fulfilled by something else _
and prophecy will cease because it will
be made obsolete Or useless (this is the probable nuance of the
Greek tern used here, katargeo_

So the
overall function of
Corinthians 13.8-13 is (0 show that love is
superior tO gifts like prophecy because those gifts will pass away
but love will not pass away:
Corinthians 13:10: The Cessation of Prophecy When Christ Returns:
Paul writes in verse 10, "But when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass
away:
The phrase

most clearly [0

Whether there be prophecies

and we prophesy imperfectly

imperfect will pass away:
Thus
the strong links between the statements are made clear by the repetition
of two key terms

and "imperfect
No doubt Paul also intended tongues tO be included in the sense of verse
among those activities that are
impertect;
but omitted overly pedantic
repetition fOr stylistic reasons
Yet tongues must be understood as part of the
sense of verse 9,for verse 9 is the reason for verse 8_
as the word "for" (Gk

Thus verse
must give the reason why tongues
well as
knowledge and prophecy; will cease. In fact, the repeated "if _
if" in
verse
suggests that Paul could have listed more gifts here (wisdom; healing;
interpretation?) if he had wished.

Several factors in the context argue that

the meaning of verse 12 seems t0 require that verse 10 is
about the time of the Lord $ retum_
The word "then" (Gk
tote) in verse 12 refers t0 the time
when the perfect comes" in
10. This is evident from looking at verse 12: "For nOw we see

(author

When shall we see "face t0 face

The phrase

is several times used in the Old
Testament

not fully or
exhaustively; for no finite creature can ever do that; but personally
and truly nonetheless. So when Paul says
"but then face t0 face" he
clearly means_
"but then we shall see God face t0 face
Indeed,
that will be the greatest blessing of heaven and our greatest joy for
all etemity (Rev: 22.4:

The second half of verse 12 says_

The second and third word for

not say; "Then

Rather; he means that when the Lord returns
Paul expects to be freed from the misconceptions and inabilities t0

part of this present life:

This means that the time when "the perfect" comes must be the
time of Christ' $ return.
Therefore,
paraphrase verse 10:
"But when Christ returns_
the imperfect will pass away:
Or; t0
use our conclusion above that "the imperfecr" included prophecy
and tongues
we can paraphrase; "But when Christ returns_
prophecy and tongues (and other imperfect gifts) will pass away:
Thus we have in
Corinthians 13.10
definite statement about the
time of the cessation of imperfect gifts like prophecy:

pass away
when Christ returns And this would
imply that they will continue t0 exist and be useful for the church;
throughout the church age, including today, and right up to the day
when Christ returns_
(2) Another reason why the time when "the perfect" comes is the
time when Christ returns is also evident from the purpose of the
passage:
Paul is attempting to emphasize the greatness of love
and
in s0 doing he wants t0 establish that "Love never
(1 Cor:
13.8).
To prove his point he argues that

when the Lord returns_
unlike present spiritual gifts_
This makes
convincing argument: love is so fundamental to God'$ plans for the
universe that it will last beyond the transition from this age t0 the
age

it will continue for eternity:

general statement from Paul about the
purpose of spiritual
in the
Testament age_
Corinthians 1:7 Paul ties the possession of spiritual gifts (Gk:
charismata) t0 the activity of
for the Lord'$ return:
YOu are
not lacking
any spiritual gift; as YOu wait for the revealing of O4T
Lord Jesus Christ:
This suggests that Paul saw the
temporary provision made
equip believers for ministry until the Lord returned. So this verse
provides
close
parallel to the thought of
Corinthians 13.8-13
where prophecy and knowledge (and no doubt tongues) are seen,
similarly; as useful until Christ'
return but unnecessary beyond that
time
Corinthians 13.10, therefore_
refers [0 the time of Christ'$ return
and says that these spiritual gifts will last among believers until that
time: This means that we have
clear biblical statement that Paul
expected these gifts to continue through the entire church age and
t0 function for the benefit of the church until the Lord returns_
Objections: Various objections t0 this conclusion have been raised, usually
by those who hold that these gifts have ceased in the church and should no
longer be used.
This Passage Does Not Specify When the Gifts Will Cease: The first
objection t0 our conclusion above comes from Richard Gaffin'=
thoughtful
study; Perspectives on Pentecost While Dr: Gaffin agrees that
when the
perfect comes
refers t0 the time 0f Christ $ return; he does not think that this
verse specifies the time of the cessation of certain gifts. He thinks, rather; that
Paul
just
"the entire period until Christ'$ return, without regard to
whether or not discontinuities may intervene during the course of this
period_
In fact; Gaffin argues, Paul $ overall purpose is to emphasize the
enduring qualities of faith_
hope, and love, especially love
and not
specify the time in which certain gifts will cease
He says:
Paul is nOt intending

will cease_
What he does affirm is the termination of the believer'$

Paul
might just as well have added "inscripturation_
and if he had done this,
the list would then have included an element that ceased
before Christ' $

(Inscripturation is the process of writing Scripture:) So, Gaffin
concludes, it might be tnue of some of the others in the list as well
In response t0 this objection it must be said that

words of the text Evangelicals have rightly
insisted (and
know that Dr: Gaffin agrees with this) that passages
of Scripture are true not only
the main point of each passage; but
also in the minor details that are affirmed as well. The main point of
the passage may well be that love lasts forever; but another point;
and certainly an important one as well; is that verse 10 affirms not

but that

Paul specifies
certain time:
When the perfect comes_
the imperfect will pass away:
But Dr:
Gaffin seems to claim that Paul is not actually saying this. Yet the
force of the words cannot be avoided by affirming that the overall
theme of the larger context is something else_
In addition,
Dr: Gaffin's suggestion does not seem t0 fit with the
logic of the passage. Paul's argument is that it is specifically the
coming of "the perfect;
which does away with prophecy; tongues
and knowledge_
because then there

might have said but in fact did not say. To say that Paul might have
included "inscripturation" in this list means that Paul might have
written; "When Christ returns, inscripturation will cease

statement;
for it would have been false
indeed
"false prophecy" in the
words of Scripture:
For "inscripturation'

book of Revelation was written by the apostle John:
So Dr: Gaffin's objections do not seem t0 overturn our conclusions
Corinthians 13.10. If "the perfect" refers to the time of Christ'$
return; then Paul says that gifts such as prophecy and tongues will
cease at thar time _
and implies therefore that they continue through

they
the church age.
#When the Perfect Comes" in
Corinthians 13.10 Refers to
Time
Earlier Than the Time of the Lord $ Return: Those who make this second
objection argue that "when the perfect comes" means one of several different
things, such as "when the church is mature
when Scripture
complete
when the Gentiles are included in the church:
Probably the most careful
statement of this view is found in the book by Robert L. Reymond, What
About Continuing Revelations and Miracles in the Presbyterian Church
Today?
but another clear statement of
similar position is found in Walter
Chantry s book, Signs of the Apostles:
Chantry' $ argument depends on the fact that elsewhere in
Corinthians the word here translated "perfect" (Gk: teleios) is used
refer t0 human maturity
Cor: 14.20, "in thinking be mature'
or to maturity in the Christian life (as in
Cor: 2.6). Yet here
we must nore that
word does nOt have t0 be used t0 refer t0 the
same
every time it is used in Scripture
in some cases [eleios
may refer t0 "mature
or "perfect" manhood_
in other cases some
other kind of
completeness
"perfection.
The word teleios is
used in Hebrews 9:11, for example_
refer t0 the
more
perfect
tent"
ye we
not therefore conclude that "perfect" in
Corinthians 13.10 must refer t0
perfect tent: The precise referent
of the word must be determined by the individual context; and
there, as
have seen, the context indicates that
when the perfect
comes
refers
the time ot Christ'$ return.
Dr: Reymond s argument
somewhat different. He reasons as
follows (p. 34):
(a) "The imperfect" things mentioned in verses 9-10
prophecy;
tongues, and knowledge
are incomplete means of revelation, "all
relating
God*s making his wil
known
his church:
(b) "The perfect" in this context must refer t0

"imperfect"
(c) Therefore "the perfect" in this context must refer to

revelation, but _

And this completed means of

Conclusion:

making
the canon of Scripture will be complete_
Reymond notes that he
not saying that "the perfect" refers
exactly t0 the canon of Scripture
but rather to "the completed
revelatory process
that resulted in Scripture (p. 32)
And in
response t0 the objection that "then we shall see face t0 face'
verse 12 refers
seeing God face to face, he answers that it may
not mean this_
but may simply mean seeing
plainly" as opposed to
obscurely" (p. 32).
In response
it may be said that this argument; while careful and
consistent in itself, still depends on one prior assumption which is
really the point at issue in this whole discussion: the authority of
New Testament prophecy and related gifts_
Once Reymond assumes
that prophecy (and tongues and the kind of "knowledge
mentioned
here) are Scripture-quality revelation, the whole argument falls into
place: The argument could be recast as follows:
(a) Prophecy and tongues are Scripture-quality revelation.
(b) Therefore this whole passage is about Scripture-quality
revelation_
(c) Therefore "the perfect" refers t0 the perfection Or completion of
Scripture-quality revelation, or the completion of Scripture_
In such an argument the initial assumption determines the
conclusion: However; before this assumption can be made,
needs
be demonstrated from
inductive analysis of the New
Testament texts on prophecy
to my knowledge, no such
inductive demonstration of the Scripture-quality authority of New
Testament congregational prophecy has been made_
Moreover; there are some other factors in the text of
Corinthians
13.8-13 that are hard t0 reconcile with Reymond'$ position. The
regular Old Testament usage of seeing "face t0 face
as an
expression not just for seeing clearly but for personally seeing God
(see above) remains unexplained
And the fact that Paul includes
himself in the expressions
Then we shall see face t0 face
and
"Then
shall know even as
have been known'
make
difficult t0
view these as references to the time of the completion of Scripture
Does Paul really think that when the other apostles finally finish

In addition tO the views of Reymond and Chantry; there have been
other attempts t0 see
when the perfect comes
as some time before
Christ' $ retum; but we will not treat them in detail here.
Such views
all break down at verse 12, where Paul implies that believers will
God "face t0 face
the perfect comes_
This cannot be
said about the time
suggested in any of these other proposals
The proposal about the completion of the canon of New Testament
Scripture (the group
writings that came [0 be included in the
New Testament) also fails t0 fit Paul'
purpose in the context: If we
take AD. 90 as the approximate date of the
of Revelation;
the last
Testament book written_
then the end of the writing of
Scripture came about thirty-five years after Paul wrote
Corinthians (about A.D: 55). But would
be persuasive [0 argue as
follows: "We can be sure that love
never end_
for we know thal
it will last more than thirty-five years"
This would hardly be
convincing argument: The context requires rather that Paul be
contrasting this age with the age to come,
and saying that love will
endure into eternity.
In fact;
We see
similar procedure elsewhere
Corinthians.
When Paul wants [0 demonstrate the eternal value
of something; he does this by arguing that it will last beyond the
day of the Lord s retum (cf;
Cor: 3.13-15; 15.51-58). By
contrast, prophecy and other gifts will not last beyond that day
Finally; these proposals fail to find any support in the immediate
context Whereas Christ'$ return is mentioned clearly in verse 12_
no verse in this section mentions
anything about the completion of
Scripture 0r

view
argue that once the last New Testament book was written (probably the
book of Revelation around AD. 90), there were t0 be no more
words of
God" spoken or written in the church: This is especially relevant for the gift
of prophecy;
according-
to the cessationist
position, because from that point on
Scripture was the complete and sufficient source of God'$ words for his
people_
To add any more words from
continuing prophetic utterances would
be; in effect; either to add to Scripture or to compete with Scripture_
In both
cases_
the sufficiency of Scripture itself would be challenged, and, in practice,
its unique authority in our lives compromised_
Now if New Testament
congregational prophecy was like Old
Testament prophecy and
Testament apostolic words in its
authority; then this cessationist objection would indeed be true: If
prophets today; for example,
words that we knew were the
very words of God, then these words would be equal to Scripture in
authority; and we would be
obligated
write them down and add
them t0 our Bibles whenever we heard them:
But if we are
convinced that God stopped causing Scripture to be written when
the book ot Revelation was completed, then we have t0 say that this
kind of speech; uttering the
words of God
cannot happen
New
spoke
very
today. And any claims t0 have
new
Scripture,

words of
God, must be rejected as false
This question is very important; because the claim that New
Testament
congregational prophecy had authority equal to Scripture
is the basis of many cessationist arguments. Yet it must be noted
that noncessationists themselves do not seem t0 view prophecy that
way. George Mallone writes,
To my knowledge no noncessationist
the mainstream of Christianity claims that revelation today is
equal with Scripture.
Perhaps it would be good for those arguing
against
continuing prophecy today
give
more
sympathetic
hearing t0 the most responsible charismatic writers, simply for the
purpose of being able tO respond to something that charismatics
actually believe (even if not always expressed in theologically
precise form) , instead of responding
something that cessationists
say that charismatics believe Or say that charismatics should
believe_
Furthermore, aside from the question of current practice 0r belief;
have
extensively elsewhere that
ordinary congregational
prophecy in New Testament churches did not have the authority of
Scripture.
It was not spoken in words that were the very words 0f
God, but rather in merely human words_
And because
has this
lesser authority, there is no reason t0 think that
will not continue
in the church until Christ returns_
It does not threaten or compete
with Scripture in authority but is subject t0 Scripture
well as to
the mature judgment of the congregation
The Question of Guidance: Another objection is sometimes raised at this
point. Some will argue that even if those who use the gift of prophecy today
say that it does not equal Scripture in authority, in fact it functions in their
lives to compete with or even replace Scripture in giving
guidance concerning
God's will Thus, prophecy today; it is said, challenges the doctrine of the
sufficiency of Scripture for guidance
our lives.
Here it must be admitted that many mistakes have been made in the
history of the church: John MacArthur points t0 the way in which
the idea of further revelations has given rise to many heretical
movements in the church:
But here the question must be_
Are abuses necessary
the
argued
functioning of the gift of prophecy? If we are
argue that mistakes
and abuses of
gift make the gift itself invalid, then we would have
tO reject Bible
teaching too (for many Bible teachers have taught
error and started cults) , and church administration aS well (for many
church leaders have led people astray), and so forth: The abuse of
gift does not mean that-
must
prohibit the proper use of the gift,
unless it can be shown that there cannot be proper use
-that all use
has
be abuse_
Moreover; specifically with respect to
guidance;
it is
good to note
how cautious many in the charismatic movement are about the use
of prophecy t0 give specific guidance: Several quotations will
illustrate this point
Michael Harper (Church of England):
Prophecies which tell other people what they are t0 do
are t0 be
regarded with great suspicion.
Dennis and Rita Bennett (American Episcopalians):
We should also be careful of personal, directive prophecy; especially
outside the

AlL Christians need

And Robert Reymond defines illumination as "the Holy Spirit $ enabling of

But if these writers will allow for the present activity of the Holy
Spirit
enabling Christians to

grasp
the
teachings of Scripture
then there does nOt
seem [0 be such
great difference in principle between what they
are saying and what many in the charismatic movement are doing
(even though there will probably be some remaining differences
over the precise way guidance functions
yer this is nOt SO much
difference about prophecy as about
guidance generally and
particularly the way guidance from Scripture relates
guidance

counsel, conscience, circumstances, sermons, etc.).
The
larger point is that what Gaffin and Reymond here call

"illumination;
the New Testament seems t0 call

and
what they would call

wonder if there may be room for more joint theological
reflection in this area. Charismatics need t0 realize that cessationists
skeptical about the scope and
frequency of such "illumination;
whether it is right to call it New Testament prophecy; whether it
really does have value for the church, and whether
should be
sought after: And cessationists need to realize that their Own highly
developed and carefully formulated doctrine of the sufficiency of
Scripture in
guidance is not usually shared or even understood by
much of evangelicalism, including those in the charismatic
movement. Nevertheless, perhaps the Reformed idea of
"illumination'
allows for what is happening in prophecy today; and
may provide
way of understanding
that is not seen as
challenging the sufficiency of Scripture
What shall we
conclude then about the relationship between the gift
of prophecy and the sufficiency of Scripture? We must say that we
appreciate the desire of the cessationists
protect the uniqueness
of Scripture and not t0 allow
anything to compete with the authority
of Scripture in our lives.
We also must be thankful for the desire of
cessationists that Christians understand and follow sound principles
of guidance in their daily lives
and not get off into an area of
excessive subjectivism that does not have the controls of Scripture
attached t0 it On the other hand, there is certainly
danger that
comes with the cessationist viewpoint
it is wrong here. It is the
very real
danger of opposing something that God is
in the
church
and failing t0 give him glory for that work God is
jealous for his works and seeks glory from them for himself, and
we must
continually pray not only that he would keep us from
endorsing error; but also that he would
uS from opposing
something that
genuinely from him:
Were Miraculous Gifts Limited to the Apostles and Their
Companions? Another cessationist argument is that miraculous gifts were
limited t0 the apostles and their close companions. Since
have discussed this
argument
length in chapter 17_
will not repeat the discussion here_
Did Miraculous Gifts Only Accompany the Giving of New Scripture?
Another objection is tO say that miraculous gifts accompanied the giving of
doing
today
keep
Scripture_
and since there is no new Scripture given today; we should expect
no new miracles today:
But in response t0 that
must be said that this is not the only
purpose for miraculous gifts.
As we noted in chapter 17, miracles
have several other purposes in Scripture: (1) they authenticate the
gospel message throughout the church age; (2)
give help t0
those in need_
and thereby demonstrate God'$ mercy and love; (3)
they
people for ministry; and (4) they glorify God.
We should also note that not all miracles accompany the giving of
additional Scripture. For example_
the ministries of Elijah and
Elisha were marked by several miracles in the Old Testament; but
wrote no books or sections of the Bible: In the New Testament;
there were many occurences of miracles that were not
accompanied by the giving of Scripture_
Both Stephen and Philip in
the book of Acts worked miracles but wrote no Scripture: There
were prophets who wrote no Scripture in Caesarea (Acts 21.4) and
Tyre (Acts 21.9-1) and Rome (Rom: 12.6) and Thessalonica
Thess. 5.20-21) and Ephesus (Eph 411) and the communities t0
which
John was written
John 4.1-6).
There were apparently
many miracles in the churches of Galatia (Gal. 3.5). There were
many miraculous things occuring at Corinth (1 Cor: 12.8-10) , but
Corinthians 14.36 Paul denies that any Scripture has come
forth from the Corinthian church:
And James expects that
will occur at the hands of the elders in all the churches t0 which he
writes (see James 5.14-16).
5. Is It a Historical Fact That Miraculous Gifts Ceased Early in the
History of the Church? Some cessationists have argued that miraculous gifts
in fact ceased when the apostles died
because the purpose of miracles was t0
give authentication to the apostles
For this reason, it is
argued, there should
be no miraculous gifts today. B. B Warfield argued this extensively in his
book; Counterfeit Miracles
In response_
it must
be said first that the premise just stated
doubtful on historical grounds_
There
increasing historical
evidence
that miraculous gifts were
occurring throughout the
history of the church in
lesser
even when
exaggerated or evidently spurious claims are discounted.
and other kinds of miraculous answers t0 prayer are often recorded_
they
equip
they

vely
degree;
greater
Healings
There were also people
claiming
to be prophets throughout the
history of the early church
-the
problem was that tOo often they
misunderstood their gift;
others misunderstood it; S0 that their
Mtterances
were (mistakenly) treated like actual words of God:
Sometimes they would be tolerated, and sometimes they were tOo
much
threat t0 the established leadership of the churches and
would begin splinter groups
tragically, no longer under the
restraining
and
evaluating authority of the established churches
Then t00_
others may have had
revelations'
given [O them which
they then did not express
or simply included without comment in
prayer; Or in
sermon 0r word of exhortation, Or in the
of a
hymn Or" some devotional literature.
should also be clear that when Paul said, "When the perfect
comes, the
imperfect will pass away" (1 Cor: 13.10) , he was not
saying anything about the relative frequency of miraculous gifts in
the history of the church:
That would be subject to much variation
depending
the spiritual maturity and vitality of the church in
various periods, the degree
which these gifts were sought as
blessing
rejected as
heresy; the frequency with which the
meetings of the church normally made provision for the exercise of
these gifts, the degree tO which the nature of these gifts was
correctly understood, and, over all of this_
the Holy Spirit's
sovereign work in
distributing gifts to the church.
What Paul is speaking about; however; is the total and final
abolition of these gifts that is to be brought about by divine
initiative at the return of Christ. And he is saying that he thinks that
until the time of the return of Christ these gifts will at least tO some
extent remain available for use_
and the
Spirit will continue t0
distribute these gifts t0 people_
Calvin notes the abundance 0f
spiritual gifts in Paul?
and then comments (on
Cor: 14.32):
Today
ouI own slender resources,
poverty in fact; but this
undoubtedly the punishment we deserve
as the reward fOL our
ingratitude. For God s riches are not exhausted
nor has His liberality
grown less; but we are not worthy of His largess,
capable of
receiving all that He generously gives.
6. Are Miraculous Gifts Today the Same As the Miraculous Gifts in
Scripture? Yet another objection to the continuation of miracles today is to
say that the
alleged miracles today are not like the miracles in Scripture
they
wtiting
Holy -
day
because they are far weaker and often are only partially effective_
In response
to this objection we must ask whether
really matters whether the miracles
today are exactly as powerful as those that occurred at the time of the
Testament. For one
we have very little information about the kind of
miracles done by ordinary Christians in various congregations, such as the
Christians at Corinth Or in the churches in Galatia:
Moreover; although
remarkable miracles done by Jesus are recorded in the gospels_
when Jesus
healed
every disease and every infirmity" (Matt: 9.35,
this must have
included many with less serious diseases_
We muSt also ask whar the expected
benefit is for the objection that miracles today are not as powerful as those in
Scripture. If today only three hundred are converted at an
evangelistic
meeting instead of the three thousand converted on the
of Pentecost (Acts
2.41), shall we say that the speaker does not really have the gift of
evangelism, since the gift did not operate as powerfully as it did with the
apostles? Or if only 30 percent of the people we pray for
regarding physical
illness are fully healed instead of 100 percent in the life of Jesus 0r of the
apostles, shall we say this
not the New Testament
gift of healing?
We
must remember that gifts can vary in strength and no gift is perfect in this age.
But does that mean that we should stop using these gifts altogether; Or oppose
them where we see them functioning with some degree of effectiveness? Shall
we not
praise God if 300 are converted rather than three thousand, 0r if 30
percent are healed rather than 100 percent of those for whom we pray? Is not
the work of the Lord being done?
quantity
not as great as in New
Testament times, then we may ask the Lord for more grace Or mercy; but it
does not seem
appropriate
give up on the use of these gifts Or to oppose
those who do use them:
7. Is It Dangerous for
Church to Allow for the Possibility of Miraculous
Gifts Today? A final objection from the cessationist position is t0 say that _
church that emphasizes the use of miraculous gifts is in danger of becoming
imbalanced
and will likely neglect other important
such as
evangelism, sound doctrine, and moral purity of life:
To say that the use of miraculous
is "dangerous" is not by
itself an adequate criticism; because some things that are right are
dangerous
at least in some sense_
Missionary work is dangerous
Driving
is dangerous_
If we define dangerous
MEdl
something might go wrong-
then
we can criticize anything that
anybody might do as
dangerous
and this just becomes an all-
purpose criticism when there is no specific abuse
point t0_
better approach with respect tO spiritual gifts is t0 ask; "Are they
used in accordance with Scripture?" and
Are adequate steps

being
being taken t0 guard
the dangers of abuse?
Of course it is tnue that churches can become imbalanced, and some
in fact have done S0
But not all will, nor do
have
do so_
Furthermore, since this argument is one based on actual results in
the life of
church; it is also appropriate to ask;, "Which churches in
the world today have the most effective
evangelism? Which have
the most sacrificial giving among their members? Which in fact
have the most emphasis 0n purity of life? Which have the deepest
love for the Lord and for his Word?" It seems t0
that it is
difficult to answer these questions clearly; but
do not think that we
can fairly say that those churches in the charismatic and Pentecostal
movements by and
are weaker in these areas than other
evangelical churches In fact, in some cases they may be stronger in
these areas.
The point is simply that any argument that says that
churches emphasizing miraculous gifts will become imbalanced is
simply not proven
actual
practice:
8. A Final Note: Cessationists and Charismatics Need Each Other: Finally;
it can be
that those
the charismatic and Pentecostal camps, and
those
the cessationist camp (primarily Reformed and dispensational
Christians) really need each other; and they would do well to appreciate each
other more_
The former tend to have more practical experience in the use of
spiritual gifts and in vitality in worship that cessationists could benefit
if they
#ere
willing
learn_
On the other hand, Reformed and dispensational
groups have traditionally been very strong in
understanding of Christian
doctrine and
deep and accurate understanding of the teachings of Scripture_
Charismatic and Pentecostal
groups could
leamn much from them if they
would be
[0 do so_
But it certainly is not helpful to the church as
whole for both sides t0 think
can learn
from the other; Or that
they can gain no benefit from fellowship with each other:
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
pter; what spiritual gift Or gifts did you think you had? Has your
understanding of your Own spiritual
gift(s) changed after studying this
chapter? In what way?
Explain how each of the spiritual gifts that YOu understand yourself to
have is greater than what would have been known
most old covenant
believers. Explain how each gift is
foretaste of some knowledge or
ability YOu will have after Christ returns.
What can You do t0 stir Up or strengthen those spiritual gifts in yOu that
need strengthening? Are there some gifts that YOu have been given but
agninst D
thev
large
argued
from:
willing -
they
nothing
have neglected? Why do you think you have neglected them? What
could be done t0 stir Up or rekindle them in you?
As you think about your Own church, which spiritual
do you think
are most effectively
functioning
at the present time? Which are most
needed in your church? Is there anything YOu can do t0 help meet those
needs?
What do you think could be done t0 help churches avoid
controversies, and even divisions, over the question of spiritual gifts?
Are there tensions in yOur own church with
t0 these questions
today? If so_
what can you do to help alleviate these tensions?
Do you think that some spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament
ceased early in the history of the church_
and are no longer valid for
today? Has your opinion on this question changed as
result of reading
this chapter?
In your viewpoint; would
church be healthier and more unified if it
concentrated on
few gifts and used them carefully and well, or if it
encouraged
multiplicity of different gifts, and allowed them to be used
at many different times by many different people? If you answered with
the latter option, what
might your church do t0 include
greater
diversity and distribution
the use of spiritual gifts? What are some of
the dangers that might accompany such widespread use
and how can
guarded against?

Chapter 52
Gifts of the Holy Spirit:
(Part 2)
Specific Gifts
How should we understand and
use
specific spiritual gifts?
EAFL
ANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
In this chapter we will build on the general discussion about
spiritual gifts in the previous chapter and examine several specific
gifts in more detail
We will not consider every gift mentioned in
the New Testament; but will focus on several gifts that are not well
understood or whose use has aroused some controversy
today:
Therefore we will not examine gifts whose
meaning and use are
self-evident from the term involved (such as serving; encouraging
contributing; showing leadership_
or showing mercy) , but will
rather concentrate 0n those in the
following list, primarily taken
from
Corinthians 12.28 and 12.8-10:
prophecy
miracles
tongues and interpretation
word of wisdom' word of knowledge
distinguishing between spirits
Proplci
Although several definitions have been given for the gift of
prophecy;
fresh examination of the New Testament teaching on
teaching
healing
this gift will show that
should be defined not as
predicting the
future,
nor as
proclaiming
word from the Lord
nor as
powerful preaching'
but rather as "telling something that God
has spontaneously brought to mind
The first four points in the
following material support this conclusion; the remaining points
deal with other considerations regarding this gift:
The New Testament Counterparts to Old Testament: Prophets Are
New 'Testament Apostles. Old Testament prophets had an amazing
responsibility
they were able to speak and write words that had absolute
divine authority. They could say; "Thus says the Lord
and the words that
followed were the very words of God: The Old Testament prophets wrote
their words as God's words in Scripture for all time (see Num 22.38; Deut:
18.18-20; Jer: 1.9; Ezek: 2.7; et al.)
Therefore; t0 disbelieve or disobey
prophet's words was to disbelieve 01
disobey God (see Deut: 18.19;
Sam:
8.7;
Kings 20.36; and many other passages).
In the New Testament there were also people who
and wrote
God's very words and had them recorded in Scripture, but
may
be surprised to find that Jesus no longer calls them

apostles:
The apostles are the New Testament
counterpart t0 the Old Testament prophets (see
Cor: 2.13;
Cor:
13.3; Gal: 1.8-9; 11-12; 2 Thess. 12.13; 4.8,15;
Peter 3.2). It is
the apostles_
not the prophets_
who have authority [0 write the
words of New Testament Scripture.
When the apostles want

(Rom_
1:1;
Cor: 1.1; 9.1-2; 2 Cor: 1.1; 11.12-13;
12.11-12; Gal: 1:1; Eph 1:1;
Peter 1.1; 2 Peter 1:1; 3.2; et al.)
2. The Meaning of the Word Prophet in the Time of the New Testament:
Why did Jesus choose the new term apostle to designate those who had the
authority t0 write Scripture? It was probably because the Greek word
prophetes
"prophet"
at the time of the New Testament had
broad
range of
It generally did not have the sense

one who

influence'
(often
spiritual influence of some kind)
1.12 uses the word
in this sense_
where Paul quotes the pagan Greek poet Epimenides:
One of

"Speak words of absolute divine authority;'
but,

Many
outside the Bible use the word prophet (Gk:
prophetes) in this way; without signifying any divine authority
the words of one called
'prophec
In fact; by the time of the New
Testament the term prophet in everyday use often simply meant

one who predicts the
future'
Or' even

(without any connotations of
divine authority). Several examples near the time of the New
Testament are given in Helmu Krimer"

(Dio
Chrysostom, AD. 40-120)

prophecy in themselves imply divine authority for their speech or
writing: Much more commonly; the words prophet and prophecy
were used of
ordinary Christians who spoke not with absolute
divine authority; but simply to report
something that God had laid
on their hearts or brought t0 their minds_
There are many
indications in the New Testament that this ordinary gift of prophecy
had authority less than that of the Bible, and even less than that of
recognized Bible
in the early church; as
evident from the
following section.
3. Indications 'That
Prophets
Did Not Speak With Authority Equal to
the Words of Scripture:
Acts 21:4: In Acts 21:4,we read of the disciples at Tyre:
Through the
Spirit they told Paul not tO go on tO Jerusalem
This seems t0 be
reference
to prophecy directed towards Paul, but Paul disobeyed it! He never would
have done this if this prophecy contained God $ very words and had authority
equal to Scripture_
Acts 21:40-H: Then in Acts 21.10-41_
Agabus prophesied that the Jews at
Jerusalem would bind Paul and "deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles
prediction that was nearly correct but not quite: the Romans_
not the Jews,
bound Paul (v 33; also 22.29),
and the Jews, rather than delivering him
voluntarily, tried t0 kill him and he had to be rescued by force
32).
The
prediction was not far off, but it had inaccuracies in detail that would have
called into question the validity of any Old Testament prophet: On the other
hand, this text could be perfectly well explained by supposing that Agabus
had had
vision of Paul as
prisoner of the Romans in Jerusalem, surrounded
by an angry mob of Jews
His own interpretation of such .
vision'
"revelation
from the Holy Spirit would be that the Jews had bound Paul and
handed him over t0 the Romans, and that is what Agabus would (somewhat
erroneously) prophesy: This is exactly the kind of fallible prophecy that
would fit the definition of New Testament congregational prophecy proposed
above
reporting in one
own words something that God has spontaneously
brought to mind
One objection t0 this view is to say that Agabus' prophecy was in
fact fulfilled_
and that Paul even reports that in Acts 28.17: "[ was
delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
But the verse itself will not support that interpretation. The Greek
teaching
text of Acts 28.17 explicitly refers to Paul's transfer out of
Jerusalem as
prisoner:
Therefore Paul $ statement describes his
transfer Out of the Jewish judicial system (the Jews were seeking t0
him again to be examined by the Sanhedrin in Acts 23.15,20)
and into the Roman judicial system at Caesarea (Acts 23.23-35).
Therefore Paul correctly says in Acts 28.18 that the same Romans
into whose hands he had been delivered as
prisoner (v 17) were
the ones who (Gk: hoitines
18) , "When
had examined me
wished to set me at liberty; because there was no reason for the
death penalty in my case
(Acts 28.18; cf: 23.29; also 25.11, 18-19;
26.31-32). Then Paul adds that when the Jews objected he was
compelled "to appeal to Caesar" (Acts 28.19; cf. 25.11). This whole
narrative in Acts 28.17-19 refers t0 Paul' $ transfer OUt of Jerusalem
t0 Caesarea in Acts 23.12-35_
and explains t0 the Jews in Rome
why Paul is in Roman custody The narrative does not refer t0 Acts
21.27-36 and the mob scene near the Jerusalem temple at all. So
this objection is nOt persuasive_
The verse does not point t0 a
fulfillment of either half of Agabus' prophecy:
does not mention
any
binding by the Jews_
does it mention that the Jews handed
Paul over [0 the Romans_
In fact; in the scene
refers to (Acts
23.12-35), once again Paul had just been taken from the Jews "by
force
(Acts 23:10), and, far from seeking to hand him over t0 the
Romans_
they were waiting in an ambush to kill him (Acts 23.13
15).
Another objection t0 my understanding of Acts 21:10-I is t0 say
that the Jews did not really have
bind Paul and deliver him into
the hands of the Gentiles for the prophecy of Agabus to be true
because the Jews were responsible for these activities even if -
did not canry them Out: Robert Thomas says, "It is common to
speak of the responsible party Or parties as performing an act even
though he or they may not have been the immediate agent(s) "@
Thomas cites similar examples from Acts 2.23 (where Peter says
that the Jews crucified Christ; whereas the Romans actually did it)
and John 19:1 (we read that Pilate scourged Jesus
whereas his
soldiers no doubt carried out the action). Thomas concludes;
therefore;, "the Jews were the ones who put Paul
chains just as
Agabus predicted_
In response_
agree that Scripture can speak of someone as doing
an act that is carried out by that person'$ agent But in every case
bring
they
they
the person who is said to do the action both wills the act to be done
and gives directions [0 Others t0 do it: Pilate directed his soldiers to
scourge Jesus. The Jews actively demanded that the Romans would
crucify Christ: By contrast; in the situation of Paul's capture in
Jerusalem, there is no such parallel. The Jews did not order him t0
be bound but the Roman tribune did it:
the tribune came up
and arrested him; and ordered him t0 be bound with two chains"
(Acts 21.33). And in fact the parallel form of speech is found here;
because, although the tribune ordered Paul to be bound
later
read that
the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was
Roman citizen and that he had bound him-
(Acts 22.29). So this
narrative does speak of the
as done either by the
responsible agent or by the people who carried
out, but in both
cases these are Romans
not Jews. In summary; this objection says
that the Jews put Paul in chains.
But Acts says twice that the
Romans bound him: This objection says that the Jews tumed Paul
over t0 the Gentiles
But Acts says that
violently refused [0
turn him over; s0 that he had to be taken from them by force: The
objection does not fit the words of the text:
Thessalonians 5.19-21: Paul tells the Thessalonians
do not despise
prophesying; but test everything; hold fast what is
(1 Thess. 5.20-21)
If the Thessalonians had thought that prophecy equaled God's Word in
authority; he would never have had to tell the Thessalonians not to despise it
received" and "accepted" God's Word
with joy from the
Spirit"
Thess_
1.6; 2.13; cf. 415). But when Paul tells them to
test
everything'
must include at least the prophecies he mentioned in the
previus phrase_
He implies that prophecies contain some
that are
good
and some
that are not
good when he encourages them to "hold fast
what is good.
This is something that could never have been said of the words
of an Old Testament prophet; or the authoritative
New
Testament apostle:
Corinthians 14:29-38: More extensive evidence on
Testament
prophecy is found in
Corinthians 14
When Paul says, "Let tWo or three
prophets speak; and let the others weigh what is said"
Cor: 14.29), he
suggests that they should listen carefully and sift the
from the bad;
accepting
sume
and rejecting the rest (for this is the implication of the Greek
word diakrino
here translated
weigh what is said")
We cannot imagine that
an Old Testament prophet like Isaiah would have said, "Listen t0 what
say
and weigh what is said
sort the good from the bad,
what yOu accept from
what you should not accept'
If prophecy had absolute divine authority;
#Then

would be sin t0 do this_
But here Paul commands that it be done, suggesting
that New Testament prophecy did not have the authority of God'$ very
words-
Corinthians 14.30, Paul allows one prophet to interrupt another
one:
revelation is made
another sitting by, let the first be
silent: For You can all prophesy one by one.
Again, if prophets had
been speaking God $ very words_
equa_
in value to Scripture; it is
hard t0 imagine that Paul
say they should be interrupted and
not be allowed
finish their message. But that is what Paul
commands-
Paul suggests that no one at Corinth;
church that had much
prophecy; was able to speak God $ very words. He says in
Corinthians 14.36_
"What! Did the word of God come
from
VOl;
are yOu the only ones
has
reached?" (author
translation).
Then in verses 37 and 38,in he claims authority far greater than any
prophet at Corinth: "If any one thinks that he is
prophet;
spiritual, he should acknowledge that what
am
t0 YOU iS
command of the Lord
If any one does not recognize this, he is not
recognized_
All these passages indicate that the common idea that prophets
spoke
words of the Lord" when the apostles
not present in
the early churches is simply incorrect
Apostolic Preparations for Their Absence: In addition t0 the verses
have considered so far; one other type of evidence suggests that New
Testament congregationa)
prophets spoke with less authority than
Testament apostles or Scripture: the problem of successors t0 the apostles is
solved not by encouraging Christians t0 listen t0 the prophets (even though
there were prophets around) but by pointing tO the Scriptures
So Paul, at the end of his life, emphasizes
rightly handling the
word of truth" (2 Tim: 2.15), and the
God-breathed" character of
scripture'
for "teaching; for reproof; for correction; and for
training in righteousness

Ic seems thar
did
have authority equal t0 the apostles
and the authors of Scripture
knew that: The conclusion is that prophecies today are not "the
words of God" either:
How Should We Speak About the Authority of Prophecy Today? So
prophecies in the church today should be considered merely human words_
not God'$ words
and not equal to God' $ words in authority. But does this
conclusion conflict with current charismatic
teaching =
practice?
think it
conflicts with much charismatic practice; but not with most charismatic
reaching_
Most charismatic teachers today would agree that contemporary
prophecy is not
to Scripture in authority. Though some
of prophecy as being the
word of God" for today; there is
almost uniform testimony from all sections of the charismatic
movement that prophecy is imperfect and impure
and will contain
elements that are not to be obeyed or trusted. For example, Bruce
Yocum; the author of
widely used charismatic book on prophecy;
writes_
Prophecy can be impure
our Own
thoughts or ideas can
get mixed into the message we receive
whether
receive the
words directly or only receive
sense of the message:
But
must be said that
actual practice much confusion results
from the habit of prefacing prophecies with the common Old
Testament phrase; "Thus says the Lord" (a phrase nowhere spoken
in the New Testament by any prophets in New Testament churches).
This is unfortunate, because it gives the impression that the words
that follow are God =
very words
whereas the New 'lestament does
not justify that position and, when pressed_
most
responsible
charismatic spokesmen would not want to claim it for every

if that introductory phrase were dropped.
Now it is true that Agabus uses

And since it will work for the

Many Christians in all periods of the church have experienced or
heard of similar events
for example_
an unplanned but urgent

Then much later those who prayed discovered that just at
that time the missionaries had been in an auto accident or at

of intense spiritual conflict; and had needed those prayers. Paul

would be called

yet it has
valuable function in the
church nonetheless_
The Difference Between Prophecy and Teaching: As far as we can tell,
all New Testament
prophecy'
was based on this kind of spontaneous
prompting from the Holy Spirit (cf. Acts 11.28; 21.4,10-1; and note the
ideas of prophecy represented in Luke
39; 23.63-64; John 4.19; 11.51)

often simply an explanation Or application of Scripture (Acts 15.35;
I1.11, 25; Rom: 2.21; 15.4; Col. 3.16; Heb: 5.12) or
repetition
and explanation of apostolic instructions (Rom: 16.17; 2 Tim 2.2;
3:10; et al.) It is what we would call "Bible teaching'
preaching" today:
So prophecy has less authority than "teaching
and prophecies in
the church are always t0 be subject
the authoritative
teaching of
Scripture. Timothy was not told to prophesy Paul's instructions in
the church; he was tO teach them (1 Tim. 411; 6.2). Paul did not
prophesy his lifestyle in Christ
every church; he taught it ( 1 Cor:
4.17). The Thessalonians were not told to hold
t0 the traditions
that were
prophesied" t0 them but to the traditions that they were
"taught" by Paul (2 Thess. 2:15). Contrary
some views, it was

(James 3.1).
The task of interpreting and applying Scripture, then, is called
"teaching" in the New Testament: Although
few people have
claimed that the prophets in New Testament churches gave
"charismatically inspired" interpretations of Old Testament
Scripture, that claim has hardly been persuasive, primarily because
it is hard to find in the New Testament any convincing examples
where the "propher" word group is used to refer tO someone
engaged in this kind of activity:
So the distinction
quite clear: if

may be said that; for the health of

And
these people are also those who have the least likelihood of being led into

Yet there is an opposite
of excessive reliance on subjective

8. Prophecies Could Include
Edifying Content: The examples of
prophecies in the New Testament mentioned above show that the idea of
prophecy as only
predicting the future'
is certainly wrong: There were some
predictions (Acts 11:28; 21:11), but there was also the disclosure of sins
Cor: 14.25). In
anything that edified could have been included
for Paul
says
"He who prophesies speaks

encouragement and consolation" (1 Cor: 14.3). Another indication of the
value of prophecy was that
could speak t0 the needs of people's hearts in
spontaneous
direct way:
9. Many People in the Congregation Can Prophesy Another
benefit
of prophecy is that it provides opportunity for participation by everyone in the
congregation, not just those who are skilled speakers or who have gifts of
teaching: Paul says that he wants "all" the Corinthians to prophesy
Cor:
14.5), and he says; "You can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn

This does not mean that every
believer will actually be able to prophesy; for Paul says, "Not all are prophets,
are they?" (1 Cor: 12.29_
author
translation).
But it does mean that anyone
who receives
"revelation'
from God has permission to prophesy (within
Paul $
guidelines), and it suggests that many will
Because of this, greater
openness t0 the
gift of prophecy could help overcome the situation where
many who attend our churches are merely spectators and not participants.
Perhaps we are
contributing to the problem of
spectator Christianity'
quenching the work of the spirit in this area_
We Should
Earnestly Desire" Prophecy: Paul valued this gift s0 highly
that he told the Corinthians; "Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the
spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy
(1 Cor: 14.1). Then at the
end of his discussion of spiritual gifts he said again, "So, my brethren,
earnestly desire
prophesy
(1 Cor: 14.39). And he said,
who
prophesies edifies the church" (1 Cor: 14.4).
If Paul was eager for the gift of prophecy tO function at Corinth;
troubled as the church was by immaturity; selfishness
divisions;
and other problems, then should we not also actively seek this
valuable gift in our
congregations today? We evangelicals who
profess
believe and obey all that Scripture says, should we not
also believe and obey this? And might a greater openness tO the gift
of prophecy perhaps help to correct
dangerous imbalance in
church life_
an imbalance that comes because
we are [0O
exclusively intellectual, objective
and narrowly doctrinal?
Encouraging and Regulating Prophecy in the Local Church: Finally, if
church begins

has not been used
before_
what should
do? How can
encourage this gift without falling into
abuse?
For all Christians
and especially for pastors and others who have
teaching responsibilities in the church, severa_
steps would be both
appropriate and pastorally wise:

gift of prophecy in ways it has already been functioning in the
church

If the

congregation and its leadership will accept it, some opportunities

Lf this is
allowed_
those who prophesy should be

of the church and not their own prestige (1 Cor: 14.12, 26), and
should not dominate the meeting or be overly dramatic Or emotional
in their speech (and thus attract attention t0 themselves rather than
the Lord):
Prophecies should certainly be evaluated according
the teachings of Scripture
Cor: 14.29-36;
Thess. 5.19-21).
(6) If the gift of prophecy begins t0 be used in a church; the church
should place even more emphasis on the vastly superior value of

Teaching
The gift of
in the New Testament is the ability [0 explain
Scripture and apply it to people=
lives.
This is evident from
number of passages_
In Acts 15.35, Paul and Bamabas and
many
others" are in Antioch
teaching and preaching the word of the
Lord =
At Corinth, Paul stayed one and
half years
teaching the
word of God among them" (Acts 18.11). And the readers of the
epistle t0 the Hebrews, though they ought tO have been teachers,
needed rather t0 have someone t0 teach them
"the first
principles of God's word" (Heb: 5.12). Paul tells the Romans that
the words of the Old Testament Scriptures
were written fOr ur
instruction (0r
"teaching;
Gk didaskalia)" (Rom: 15.4), and writes
Timothy that

Of course, if
"teaching"
in the early church was s0 often based on
Old Testament Scripture, it is not
surprising that
could also be
based on something equal
to Scripture
authority, namely;
received body of apostolic instructions. So Timothy was t0 take the
teaching he had received from Paul and commit it to faithful men
who would be able t0 "teach others also"
(2 Tim: 2.2). And the
Thessalonians were to "hold firm t0 the traditions'
they were
"taught" by Paul (2 Thess. 2.15). Far from
based on a
spontaneous revelation that came
during the worship service of the
church (as prophecy was)
this kind of "teaching" was the repetition
and explanation of authentic
teaching: To teach contrary

Just after apostles, prophets and teachers
Paul says "then miracles'
Cor: 12.28). Although many of the miracles seen in the New
Testament were specifically miracles of healing; Paul here lists
healing as
separate gift Therefore in this context he must have
something other than physical healing in view
We should realize that the English word miracles may not give
very close approximation t0 what Paul intended, since the Greek
word is simply the plural form of the word dynamis
power:
This means that the term may refer to any kind of activity where
God'$ mighty power is evident It may include answers t0 prayer
for deliverance from physical danger (as in the deliverance of the
apostles from prison in Acts 5.19-20 0r 12.6-11), or powerful
works of judgment on the enemies of the gospel or those who
require discipline within the church (see Acts 5.1-11; 13.9-12) , or
miraculous deliverance from injury (as with Paul and the viper in
Acts 28.3
But such acts of spiritual
power may also include
power t0 triumph over demonic opposition (as in Acts 16.18; cf.
Luke 10.17).
Since Paul does not define "works of miracles" any more
specifically than this_
we can say that the gift of miracles may
include the working of divine power in deliverance from danger; in
intervention t0 meet special needs in the physical world (as in the
Case
of Elijah in
17:1-16), in judgment on those who
irrationally and violently oppose the gospel message, in
vanquishing the demonic forces that wage war against the church;
and in any other way
which God's power is manifested in an
evident way to further God's purposes in
situation:
All of these
would be works of "power" in which the church would be helped
and God $ glory would be made evident (See also the discussion of
miracles in chapter 17.)

1. Introduction: Sickness and Health in the History of Redemption: We
must realize at the outset that physical sickness came as
result of the fall of
Adam, and illness and disease are simply part of the
outworking of the curse
after the fall, and will eventually lead toward physical death: However; Christ
redeemed us from that curse when he died on the cross:
Surely he took up
our infirmities and carried OuI SOITOWS
by his wounds we are healed" (Isa_
53.4-5 NIV)
This passage refers to both physical and spiritual
that
Christ purchased for US, for Peter quotes it tO refer t0 our salvation:
himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
that we might die t0 sin and live
to righteousness
By his wounds VOU have been healed" ( 1 Peter 2.24).
But Matthew quotes the same passage from Isaiah with reference to
the physical healings Jesus performed:
and he cast out the spirits
with
word, and healed all who were sick This was
fulfill what
was spoken by the prophet Isaiah,
He took our infirmities and bore
ouI diseases
(Matt_ 8.16-17).
AlI Christians would probably agree that in the atonement Christ
has purchased fr US not only complete freedom from sin but also
complete freedom from physical
weakness and
infirmity in his
work of redemption (see chapter 42 on glorification) And all
Christians would also no doubt agree that our full and complete
possession of all the benefits that Christ earned for uS will not come
until Christ returns:
is only
at his coming
(1 Cor: 15.23) that we
receive OuI
perfect resurrection bodies_
So it is with physical
healing and redemption from the physical sickness that came as
result of the curse in Genesis %: our complete possession of
redemption from physical illness will not be ours until Christ
returns and we receive resurrection bodies_
But the question that confronts Us with respect t0 the gift of
is whether God may from time tO time grant uS
foretaste 0r
down payment of the physical healing which he will
uS fully
in the future:
The
miracles of Jesus certainly demonstrate
that at times God is
to grant
partial foretaste of the perfect
health that will be ours for eternity. And the ministry of healing
seen in the lives of the
apostles and others in the early church also
indicates that this was part of the ministry of the new covenant age.
As such; it fits the
pattern of blessings in the new covenant;
many O1 all of which give partial foretastes of the blessings that will

We "already" possess some of the
blessings of the kingdom, but those blessings are

ourS.
The Purposes of Healing: As with other spiritual gifts, healing has several
purposes_
Certainly
functions as
'sign"
authenticate the gospel
message_
and show that the kingdom of God has come: Then also healing
brings comfort and health to those who are ill, and thereby demonstrates
God's attribute of mercy toward those
distress. Third, healing equips
people for service; as physical impediments
ministry are removed. Fourth;
provides opportunity for God to be glorified as people see physical
evidence of his goodness
power; wisdom, and presence:
3. What About the Use of Medicine? What is the relationship between
prayer for
and the use of medicine and the skill of
physician?
Certainly we should use medicine if it is available because God has also
created substances in the earth that can be made into medicine with healing
properties.
Medicines thus should be considered part of the whole creation
that God considered
very
(Gen: 1.31). We should willingly use
medicine with thankfulness t0 the Lord, for "The earth is the LORD
and the
fulness thereof" (Ps.
24.1). In fact; when medicine is available and
refuse

where it would put ourselves 0r others in danger) , then
seems that we are wrongly
test" on the Lord our God (cf. Luke
4.12): this is similar tO the case of Satan tempting Jesus t0 jump from the
temple rather than walking down the steps.
Where ordinary means of getting
down from the temple (the steps) are available, it is "forcing
test" on God [0
jump and thereby demand that he perform
miracle at that exact moment:
refuse t0 use effective medicine, insisting that God perform
miracle of
healing instead of healing through the medicine; is very similar t0 this_
Of course, it is wrong t0 rely on doctors Or medicine instead of
relying on the Lord_
mistake tragically made by King Asa:
In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his
and
his disease became severe; yet even in his disease he did not seek the
LORD
but sought help from physicians_
And Asa slept with his
fathers, dying in the
first year of his reign: (2 Chron: 16.12-13)
But if medicine is used in connection with prayer; then we should
expect God to bless and often multiply the effectiveness of the
medicine.
Even when Isaiah had received
the Lord
promise of healing for King Hezekiah, he told Hezekiah $ servants

However; sometimes there is no appropriate medicine available_
the medicine does not work: Certainly we must remember that God
can heal where doctors and medicine cannot heal

4S t0 realize how frequently doctors cannot heal, even in the mOst
medically advanced countries

flow of blood for twelve years and
could not be healed by any one
then
came up behind him, and
touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of
blood ceased" (Luke 8.43-44).
There were no doubt many people
beyond the help of physicians who came whenever Jesus was
teaching and healing:
we read that "all those who had any that
were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid
his hands on every one of them and healed them" (Luke 4.40).
There was no disease that Jesus was unable to heal
Does the New Testament Show Common Methods Used in Healing?
The methods used by Jesus and the disciples to
varied from case
case, but most
frequently they included laying on of hands.
In the verse
just quoted, Jesus no doubt could have spoken
powerful word of command
and healed everyone in the large crowd instantly; but instead, "he laid his
hands on every one of them and healed them" (Luke 4.40). Laying on of
hands seems to have been the primary means Jesus used to heal; because
when people came and asked him for

prayer but said, for example,

(Matt: 9.18).
Another physical symbol of the Holy Spirit'$ power coming for
was anointing with oil. Jesus' disciples
anointed with oil
many that were sick and healed them" (Mark 6.13) And James tells
the elders of the church to anoint the sick person with oil when they
pray: "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the
church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man,
and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed
will be forgiven'
(James 5.14-15).
The New Testament often emphasizes the role of faith in the
process
sometimes the faith of the sick person (Luke
8.48-
17:19) , but at other times the faith of others who bring the
sick person for healing_
James 5.15 it is the elders who pray; and
James says it is "the prayer of faith" that saves the sick person
this then must be the faith of the elders praying;
not the faith of

(Mark 2.5). At other times
Jesus mentions the faith of the Canaanite woman regarding the

healing of his servant (Matt: &.10, 13)
How 'Then Should We

regarding physical illness? Certainly it is right to ask God for healing
Jesus tells us t0 pray;
Deliver us from evil" (Matt_ 6.13), and the apostle John
writes [0

God would be like.

we should remember that we must
pray for God to be glorified
the situation, whether he chooses
heal 0r not:
And we also ought
pray ouL of the same compassion
of heart that Jesus felt for those whom he healed: When we pray
this way; God will sometimes
and perhaps often
grant answers
our prayers
Someone may object at this point
from
pastoral standpoing;
much harm is done when people are encouraged to believe that
miracle of healing will occur and then nothing happens
disappointment with the church and anger at God may result: Those
who pray for people to be healed
need t0 hear this objection
and use wisdom
what they tell people who are ilL.
But we also need t0 realize that there
more than one kind of
mistake
make:
Not praying for healing at all is not _
correct
solution, for
involves disobedience
James
(2) Telling people
that God seldom heals today and that they should expect nothing
happen is not
correct solution either; for it does not provide an
atmosphere conducive t0
and
inconsistent with the pattern
we see in the ministry of Jesus and the early church in the New
Testament: (3)
people that God always heals today if we
have enough faith is
cruel
teaching not supported by Scripture
(see secrion
below):
Very
healing:
healing
healing
that;
today
Faith
Telling "
The pastorally wise solution; it seems, lies between (2) and (3)
above:
We can tell people that God frequently heals today (if
believe that is true), and that it is very possible that they
healed
but that we are still
in an age when the kingdom of
God is "already
here but
not _
fully here. Therefore Christians
in this life will experience
many other answers to
prayer), but they will also experience continuing illness and
eventual death_
In each individual case it is God s sovereign
wisdom that decides the outcome
and ouI role
simply t0 ask him
and wait for him tO answer (whether "yes'
praying
and wair"
Those with
gifts of healings" (a literal
translation of the plurals
Cor: 12.9, 28) will be those people who find that their prayers for
are answered more frequently and more thoroughly than
others_
When that becomes evident;
church would be wise t0
encourage them in this ministry and give them more opportunities
L0 pray for others who are ilL.
We should also realize that gifts of
healing could include ministry not only in terms of physical
healing; but also in terms of emotional healing_
And ir may at times
include the ability to set people free from demonic attack; for this is
also called ~healing
sometimes in Scripture (see Luke 6.18; Acts
10.38) . Perhaps the gifts of being able t0 pray effectively in
different kinds of situations and for different kinds of needs are
what Paul referred t0 when he used the plural expression,
gifts of
healings:
6. But What if God Does Not Heal? Nonetheless,
we muSt realize that not
all prayers for
will be answered in this age_
Sometimes God will not
grant the special "faith'
(James 5.15) that healing will occur; and at times
God will choose not to heal, because of his own sovereign purposes. In these
cases we mUSE remember that Romans 8.28 is still true: though we experience
the "sufferings of this present time,
and though we
groan inwardly as we
wait for
the redemption of our bodies" (Rom 8.18, 23), nonetheless_
know that in
everything God works for good with those who love him, who
are called
according 5
to his purpose
(Rom: 8.28). This includes
circumstances
suffering and illness as well.
Whatever Paul's "thorn in the flesh" was
centuries of work by
Bible
believing interpreters have failed tO turn up
definitive
answer), Paul realized that God allowed it t0 remain with him

(and

(and
Fto

humble before the Lord
So the Lord told him,
My grace is
sufficient for You_
tor my powel

Cor: 12.9).
There are indications in the early church that even in the
presence of the apostles not all people were healed. Paul recognized
that
our outer nature is wasting away" (2 Cor: 4:16), and
sometimes disease and illness will not be healed_
When
Epaphroditus came t0 visit Paul, he had an illness that brought him
near t0 death" (Phil. 2.27). Paul indicates in the narrative of
Philippians
that
appeared as though Epaphroditus were going
die
that God did not heal him immediately when he became ill:
But eventually God did heal (Phil. 2.27) in answer t0 prayer: Paul
told Timothy that he should drink _
little wine "for the sake of your
stomach and your frequent ailments'
(1 Tim: 5.23). He said,
"Trophimus
left ill at Miletus
(2 Tim: 4.20).
And both Peter ( 1
Peter 1.6-7; 4.19) and James (James 1.2-4) have words of
encouragement and counsel
tor those who are
suffering trials of
various kinds:
Count it all joy; my brethren, when yOu meet various trials, for YOu
know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness
And let
steadfastness have its full effect; that YOu may be perfect and
complete
lacking
nothing
(James 1.2
When God chooses not to heal, even though we ask him for it, then
it is right that we
give thanks in all circumstances"
Thess. 5.18)
and realize that God can use sickness t0 draw US closer t0 himself
and t0 increase
us obedience t0 his will.
So the psalmist can say;
"Itis good for me that_
was afflicted, that
might learn your
stalutes"
(Ps. 119.71), and, "Before
Wds
afflicted
went astray;
but now
keep your word" (Ps. 119.67)
Therefore God can bring increased sanctification t0 US through
illness and suffering
just as he can bring sanctification and growth
in faith through miraculous healing: But the emphasis of the New
Testament; both in Jesus' ministry and in the ministry of the
disciples in Acts, seems to be one that encourages US in most cases
eagerly and earnestly to seek God for healing; and then
continue
t0 trust him [0
good out of the situation
whether he grants the
physical healing Or not: The point is that in
everything God should
receive glory and 0ur joy and trust in him should increase _

It should be said at the outset that the Greek word glossa, translated
is used not only to mean the physical tongue in
person'$
mouth, but also t0 mean
~language.
In the New Testament
passages where
speaking in tongues is discussed, the meaning
"languages
is certainly in view. It is unfortunate
therefore, that
English translations have continued to use the phrase "speaking
rongues,
which is an
expression not otherwise used in ordinary
English and which gives the impression of
strange experience
something completely foreign to ordinary human life_
But if
English translations were tO use the expression
speaking in
languages
it would not seem nearly as strange, and would give the
reader
sense much closer to what first century Greek
speaking
readers would have heard in the phrase when they read it in Acts r
Corinthians
However; because current usage of the phrase
speaking
tongues'
is s0 widely established, we will continue to
use
in this discussion:
Tongues in the History of Redemption: The phenomenon of speaking in
tongues is unique
the new covenant age:
Before Adam and Eve fell into
sin, there was no need [0 speak in other languages; because they spoke the
same
language and were united in service of God and in fellowship with him.
After the fall people spoke the same language but eventually became united
opposition to God, and "the wickedness of man was great in the
and
every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually"
(Gen: 6.5). This unified language used in rebellion against God culminated in
the building of the tower of Babel at
time when
'the whole earth had one
uage and few words" (Gen. 11:1). In order to stop this united rebellion
against him; God at Babel
"confused the
language of all the earth" and
scattered people abroad over the face of the earth (Gen: 11.9).
When God called Abraham to himself (Gen: 12.1), he promised to
make of Abraham
great nation'
(Gen. 12.2), and the nation of
[srael
that resulted from this call had one language that God wanted
them to use in service for him. Yet this language was not spoken by
the rest of the nations of the world
and
remained ourside the
reach of God*s plan of redemption. So the situation was improved
somewhat; for one language out of all the languages of the world
used
service 0f God , whereas
Genesis 11 God was not
praised with any language.
Now if we
pass over the age of the New Testament church and look
etemity future
we see that once

restored, but this time everyone will once again speak the same
language in service of God, and in praise t0 him (Rev 7.9-12; cf:
Zeph: 3.9;
Cor: 13.8; perhaps Isa: 19.18).
In the New Testament church, there

the unity of language that will exist in heaven,
but it is given only at
some times, and only in a partial way At Pentecost, which was the
point at which the gospel began t0 g0 to all nations_
it was
appropriate that the disciples gathered in Jerusalem
speak
in other tongues, aS the Spirit gave them utterance'
(Acts 2.4).
The result was that Jewish visitors t0 Jerusalem from various
nations all heard
their own languages
proclamation of "the
mighty works of God" (Acts 2:11).
was
remarkable symbol
of the fact that the gospel message was about t0 g0 forth to all the
nations of the world_
Such
symbolic action would have been
inappropriate in the Old Testament, for there the
evangelistic
message was one of
people from other nations t0 come and
join themselves to the Jewish people and become Jews, and thereby
worship God. But here the message is about tO go to each nation in
itS Own
language,
people in every place t0 turn to Christ
and be saved:
Moreover; within the context of the worship service of the church_
speaking in tongues plus interpretation gives further indication of
promise that one day the differences in languages that originated at
Babel will be overcome. If this gift is operating in
church, nO

Cor: 13.9), but it is still an improvement on the situation
from Babel
to Pentecost when there was no provision t0 enable
people to understand
message in
language they did not know:
Finally; prayer in tongues in
private setting is another form of
prayer t0 God. Paul says
pray in
[ongue
my spirit prays but
my mind is unfruitful"
Cor: 14.14). In the overall context of the
history of redemption, this also may be seen as one more partial
solution to the results of the fall; whereby we were cut off from
fellowship with God_
Of course_
this does not mean that people'$
spirits can only have fellowship with God when

for Paul affirms that he prays and

sings
and in his own language (1 Cor: 14:15). However; Paul does see
prayer in tongues as an additional means of fellowship directly with
God in prayer and worship. Once again; this aspect of the gift of
speaking in tongues was nOt operative
far as we know; before
the new covenant age:
2. What Is Speaking in Tongues? We may define this gift as follows:
Speaking in tongues
prayer 0r praise
spoken in syllables not understood by
the speaker:
Words of Prayer or Praise Spoken to God: This definition indicates that
speaking in tongues is primarily speech directed toward God (that is_
prayer
praise). Therefore it is unlike the gift of prophecy; which frequently
consists of messages directed from God toward people in the church. Paul
says
one who speaks in
tongue
not to men but to God" (1 Cor:
14.2), and if there is no interpreter present at the church service, Paul says
that someone who has
gift of speaking in tongues should
silence in
church and speak to himself and t0 God
(1 Cor: 14.28).
What kind of speech is this that is directed toward God? Paul says,
pray in
tongue
my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful"
Cor: 14.14; cf: W 14-17_
where Paul categorizes speech in tongues
as praying and giving thanks_
and
28). Therefore speaking in
tongues apparently is prayer
praise directed t0 God_
and
comes
from the
spirit" of the person who is speaking: This is not
inconsistent with the narrative in Acts
because the crowd said,
"we hear them
in our Own tongues the mighty works of
God" (Acts 2:11),
description that certainly could mean that the
disciples were all glorifying God and
proclaiming his mighty works
worship_
and the crowd
began to listen to this aS it occurred in
various languages
In fact; there is no indication that the disciples
themselves were speaking t0 the crowd until Acts 2:14_
when Peter
then stands and addresses the crowd directly; presumably in
Greek
Not Understood by the Speaker: Paul says that
one who
in a
tongue
not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he
utters mysteries in the Spirit" (1 Cor: 14.2). Similarly; he says that if there is
speaking in tongues without interpretation no meaning will be communicated:
shall be
foreigner tO the speaker and the speaker
foreigner tO me"
Cor: 14.11). Moreover; the entire paragraph of
Corinthians 14.13-19
assumes that speech in tongues in the congregation; when it is not
speaks
"keep -
telling -
speaks
speaks
accompanied by interpretation, is not understood by those who hear:
Therefore_
he who speaks in
tongue should pray for the power to
interpret: For if
pray in
tongue_
my spirit prays but my mind is
unfruitful. What am
do?
will pray with the spirit and
will pray
with the mind also;
sing with the spirit and
will sing with the
mind also.
Otherwise, if you bless
the spirit; how can any one in
the position of an outsider say the
Amen" to your thanksgiving when
he does not know what you are saying? For YOu may give thanks well
enough; but the other man is nOt edified_
thank God that
speak in
tongues more than you all; nevertheless, in church
would rather
speak five words with my mind, in order t0 instruct others _
than ten
thousand words in
tongue.
Now at Pentecost speech in tongues was in known
languages that
were understood by those who heard:
each one heard them
speaking in his own language
(Acts 2.6).
But once again the
speech was not understood by the speakers_
for what caused the
amazement was that Galileans were
speaking all these different
languages (v 7). It seems, therefore
that at times speaking in
tongues may involve speech in actual
human languages, sometimes
even
languages that are understood by some of those who hear: But
at other times
-and Paul assumes that this will ordinarily be the
case
the speech will be in _
language that
'no one understands" (1
Cor: 14.2).
Some have objected that speaking in tongues must always consist
of speech in known human languages, since that is what happened
at Pentecost But the fact that
speaking in tongues occurred in
known human
languages once in Scripture does not require that it
always happen with known languages, especially when another
description of speaking in tongues
Cor: 14) indicates exactly the
opposite.
Paul does not say that foreign visitors
Corinth will
understand the speaker; but he says that when someone
tongues
no one
will understand and the outsider will not know
what the person is
saying (1 Cor: 14.2, 16).
In fact; Paul explicitly
says that quite the opposite of the phenomenon at Pentecost will
happen in the ordinary conduct of church life: if "all speak in
tongues"
and
outsiders or unbelievers enter;
far from
understanding the message;
they will say "that you are mad" (1 Cor:
14.23). Moreover; we must realize that
Corinthians 14 is Paul '$
genera

wide experience of tongues-speaking
Will
with

many different churches, whereas Acts
simply describes one
unique event at
significant turning point
the history of
redemption (Acts 2 is historical narrative while
Cor: 14 is
doctrinal instruction). Therefore
would seem appropriate t0 take
Corinthians 14 as the passage that mOst closely describes the
ordinary experience of New Testament churches, and t0 take Paul's
instructions there as the standard by which God intends churches t0
regulate the use of this gift.
Are tongues known human languages then? Sometimes this gift
may result in
speaking in
human language that the speaker has not
leamed
but ordinarily
seems that it will involve speech in
language that no one understands
whether that be
human
language
01 not:
Prayer With the Spirit; Not With the Mind: Paul says: "If
pray in a
tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am
to do?
will pray
with the spirit and
will pray with the mind
will sing with the
and
sing with the mind also
(1 Cor: 14.14-15).
Paul is not here
about the Holy Spirit praying through us_
The contrast between
my
and
my mind" in verse 14
indicates that it is Paul' $ own human spirit that he is
talking about;
the nonmateriab
aspect of his being
As he uses this gift, his spirit
directly to God_
even though his mind does not have to
formulate words and sentences and decide what to pray for:
Paul
sees this kind of prayer as an activity that occurs in the spiritual
realm; whereby our spirits speak directly to God but our mind is
somehow bypassed and does not understand what we are praying
We may wonder why God would give the church
gift that
operates in the unseen_
spiritual realm and that is not understood by
minds_
One reason may be to keep us humble, and to help
prevent intellectual pride.
Another reason may be to remind us that
God
greater than Our understanding and that he works in ways
that transcend our understanding: Finally, it is characteristic of
much that God does
the new covenant age that it is done in the
unseen, spiritual realm: regeneration, genuine prayer; worship "in
spirit and in truth;
the spiritual blessings that come through the
Lord'$ Supper; spiritual warfare, laying Up treasures in heaven,
setting our minds 0n

all these and

things
many more elements of the Christian life involve activities that
occur in the unseen, spiritual realm; activities that we do not see 0r
fully understand. In that light, speaking in tongues is simply another
activity that occurs in the unseen spiritual realm; an activity we
believe is effective because Scripture tells uS it is, not because we
can comprehend
with our minds (cf:
Cor: 14.5).
d. Not Ecstatic but Self-controlled: The New English Bible translated the
phrase "speaking in tongues'
ecstatic speech;
thus giving further suppOrt
the idea that those who
in tongues lose awareness of their
surroundings =
lose self-control 0r are forced [0
speak
their will:
Moreover; some of the extreme elements in the Pentecostal movement have
allowed frenzied and disorderly conduct at worship services, and this has_
the minds of some,
perpetuated the notion that speaking in tongues is
kind
of ecstatic speech:
But this is not the picture given in the New Testament: Even when
the Holy Spirit came with
overwhelming power
Pentecost; the
disciples were able to stop speaking in tongues S0 that Peter could
give his sermon
the assembled crowd. More explicitly, Paul says:
If any speak in
tongue
let there be only two or at most three, and
each in turn; and let one interpret: But if there is no one t0 interpret;
let each of them keep silence
church and
himself and
God
(1 Cor: 14.27-28)
Here Paul requires that those who speak in tongues take turns_
and he limits
the number to three, indicating clearly that those who spoke in tongues were
aware of what was going on around them; and were able to contro)
themselves So aS t0
speak only when it was their turn, and when no one else
was
speaking: If there was no one t0 interpret; they were easily able to keep
silence and not speak All of these factors indicate
degree of self-
control and give no support tO the idea that Paul thought of tongues as ecstatic
speech of some kind.
Tongues Without Interpretation: If no one known to have the gift of
interpretation is present in the assembly; the passage just quoted indicates that
speaking in tongues should be in private.
No speech in tongues without
interpretation should be given in the church service:
Paul
of praying in tongues and
singing in tongues when he
says,
"Twill pray with the spirit and
will pray with the mind also;
speak
against (
speak
high ,
speaks
will sing with the
and
will
with the mind also" (1 Cor:
14.15). This gives further confirmation to the definition given
above in which we viewed tongues as something primarily directed
toward God in prayer and praise_
It also gives legitimacy to the
practice of singing
tongues, whether publicly or privately. Yet the
same rules apply for singing as for speaking
it there is no
interpreter;
should only be done in private.
Corinthians 14.20-25 Paul says that if believers speak in
tongues without interpretation in church;
will be
and
like
children'
Cor: 14.20). He first quotes
prophecy
of judgment from Isaiah 28.11-12: "In the law it is written,
By
men of
strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will
speak t0
this people, and even then
will not listen t0 me
says the
Lord'
(1 Cor: 14.21).
In the context of Isaiah 28,God
warning the rebellious people of
[srael that the next words
heard from him would be words of
foreigners that they could not understand
the Assyrian army
would come 0n them as
of God's judgment: Now Paul is
about t0 take this as
general principle
when God speaks to
people in language they cannot understand_
is quite evidently
sign of God's judgment
Paul rightly applies that to the situation of speaking in tongues
without interpreration in the church service. He calls it
sign (that
sign of judgment) on unbelievers:
Thus
tongues are
sign not for believers but for unbelievers_
while
prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers: If, therefore, the
whole church assembles and all speak in tongues
and outsiders or
unbelievers enter; will
not say that you are mad?
Cor: 14.22
23)
Here Paul uses the word "sign"
mean
'sign of God $ attitude
(whether
positive or negative) Tongues that are not understood by outsiders are
certainly
negative sign
sign of judgment Therefore Paul cautions the
Corinthians not t0 give such
sign to outsiders who come in. He tells them if
an outsider comes in and hears only unintelligible speech, he will certainly
not be saved but will conclude that the Corinthians are mad, and the
uninterpreted tongues will in his case function as
sign
God $ judgment
spirit

By contrast; Paul says that prophecy is
sign of God s attitude as
well; but here
positive sign of God's blessing: This is why he can
say that prophecy is
sign "for believers'
22). And this is why
he concludes his section by saying; "If all prophesy; and an
unbeliever 0r outsider enters, he is convicted by all; he is called t0
account by all, the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and s0, falling
on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really
among you" (VV 24-25). When this happens_
believers will
certainly realize that God is active among them to bring blessing_
and prophecy
regularly function as
sign for believers of
God'$ positive attitude for them.
Nevertheless, however much Paul warns against using tongues
without interpretation in church; he certainly views
positively and
encourages
private_
He says
"He who speaks in
tongue
edifies himself; but he who prophesies edifies the church" (1 Cor:
14.4).
What is his conclusion? It is nOt (as some would
argue) that
Christians should decide not tO use the gift or decide that it has no
value when used privately:
Rather he says, "What am
to do?
pray with the spirit and
Will
with the mind also" (v 15). And
he says;
thank God that
speak in tongues more than you all"
18), and "Now
want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to
prophesy" (v. 5) , and "Earnestly desire to prophesy; and do not
forbid
speaking in tongues
(v 39). If our previous
understanding
of tongues aS prayer Or praise to God
correct; then we would
certainly expect that edification would follow, even though the
speaker's mind does not understand what is being said, but his O1
her own human spirit is
communicating directly with God. Just as
prayer and worship in general edify us as we engage in them; 5O
this kind of prayer and worship edifies US tOO, according to Paul.
Tongues With Interpretation: Edification for the Church: Paul says_
"He who prophesies is greater than he who
in tongues_
unless someone
interprets, SO that the church may be edified" (1 Cor: 14.5)
Unce
message
in tongues
interpreted_
all can understand_
In that case
Paul says that the
message in tongues is aS valuable t0 the church as prophecy We should note
that he does not say
have the same functions (for other passages indicate
that prophecy is communication from God toward human beings_
tongues is generally communication from human
God).
But Paul
clearly says
have equal value in edifying the church:
g. Not All Speak in Tongues: Just aS not all Christians are apostles, and not

they
while
beings
they
all are prophets or teachers, and not all possess gifts of healing
so not all
speak with tongues. Paul clearly implies this when he asks
series of
questions, all of which expect the answer
no,
and includes the question
all speak with
tongues?" (1 Cor: 12.30).
The implied answer is no_
Some
have
that Paul here only means that not all speak
tongues
publicly, but that perhaps he would have admitted that all can speak in
tongues privately But this distinction seems foreign tO the context and
unconvincing
He does not specify that not all speak with tongues publicly or
in church, but simply says that not all speak with tongues_
His next question
is, "Do all interpret?"
30). His previous tWo questions were
"Do all work
miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing?" (vv 29-30). Would we wish t0
make the same arguments about these
that not all interpret tongues
publicly; but that all Christians are able to do
privately? Or that not all work
miracles publicly; but that all are able to work miracles privately? Such
distinction seems unwarranted by the context
every case.
In actuality; the desire to say that every Christian can speak in
tongues (even though Paul says that not all speak in tongues) is
probably motivated
most cases by
prior doctrinal understanding
that views baptism in the Holy Spirit as an experience subsequent
[0 conversion;
and sees speaking in tongues as an initial "sign" of
receiving this baptism in the
Spirit.
But there are serious
questions that remain about this doctrinal position (as explained in
chapter 39). It seems better t0 take
Corinthians 12.30 t0 mean just
whal
says_
not all
tongues. The gift of tongues
~just
every other gift
-is not given by the Holy Spirit tO every Christian
who seeks ic He
apportions t0 each one individually as he wills'
Cor: 12.11).
However; there is
Scripture that says that only
few will
receive the gift of speaking
rongues_
and_
since it is
gift Paul
views as
edifying and useful in prayer and worship (on
personal
level even if not in church), it
not be surprising if the Holy
Spirit gave
very widespread distribution of this gift and many
Christians in fact received it
What About the
Danger of Demonic Counterfeit? At times Christians
have been afraid to speak in tongues, wondering if speaking something they
do not understand might involve them in speaking blasphemy against God or
speaking something that
prompted by
demon rather than by the Holy
Spirit:

with

First, it must be said that this is not Paul'$ concem_
even in the city
of Corinth where many had come from pagan temple worship
and
where Paul had clearly said that
what pagans sacrifice they offer to
demons and not to God" (1 Cor: 10.20). Nonetheless
Paul says,
want yOu all to speak in tongues"
(1 Cor: 14.5). He gives no
waming that they should beware of demonic counterfeit or even
think that this would be
possibility when
use this gift
The theological reason underlying Paul's encouragement
that
point is the fact that the Holy Spirit is working powerfully within
the lives of believers_
Paul says,
want YOu t0 understand that no
one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says
Jesus be cursed!
and
no one can say *Jesus is Lord' except by the
Spirit"
Cor:
12.3) . Here Paul reassures the Corinthians that if they are speaking
by the power of the Holy Spirit working within them,
will not
say,
Jesus be cursedl"
Coming as it does at the beginning of
discussion of spiritual gifts_
Corinthians 12.3 is intended t0
function as reassurance t0 the Corinthians who may have
suspected
some Christians who came from backgrounds of demon worship in
the temples at Corinth. Might this demonic influence still affect
their use of
spiritual gift? Paul lays down the ground rule that
those who genuinely profess faith that"
Jesus is Lord" are doing 5O
by the Holy Spirit working within, and that no one speaking by the
power of the Holy Spirit will ever speak blasphemy or curses
against Jesus.
This fear; then; is not one that Paul seemed troubled
by. He simply encouraged believers t0 pray in tongues and said that
if they did s0
would be
themselves_
Is Romans 8.26-27 Related to Speaking in Tongues? Paul writes in
Romans 8.26-27:
Likewise the Spirit helps us
our weakness; for we do not know how
pray as
ought; but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs
[OO
for words.
And he who searches the hearts of men knows
what is the mind of the Spirit; because the Spirit intercedes for the
saints
according to the will of God
Paul does not mention speaking in tongues explicitly here
and the statement
general one concerning the life of all Christians_
so it does not seem
correct t0 say that Paul here is referring tO speaking in tongues. He is referring
more
general experience that occurs in the prayer life of every Christian.
they
Holy

they
edifying
deep
But what exactly is he talking about? Some have thought that he is
referring to an intercessory activity completely imperceptible t0 uS_
in which the Holy Spirit intercedes for us by making sighs and
groans t0 the Father: On this view; such intercessory work of the
Spirit goes on continually, but we have no idea that it is happening
(except for the fact that Scripture tells 4s this). In this way
would
be similar to the intercessory work of Christ mentioned in Romans
8.34 and Hebrews 7.25-
But this does not appear
satisfactory explanation of the
passage, for several reasons: (1) It would not seem probable that
Paul would say that the intercessory work of the Holy Spirit; who is
the infinite , omnipotent;, omniscient God, would be carried out in
wordless groans
(literal translation of stenagmois alaletois in
Rom. 8.26), especially when we realize that
groans
refers [0 the
intense sighs of fatigue that are appropriate
weary; burdened
creatures in
fallen world:
Within the
larger context the
groanings in view seem t0 be those due t0 the burden of
living in
this present
age, particularly the groans associated with
suffering
this age (see vv_
17, 18, 23). (3) The verb ~helps" in
Romans 8.26
The Spirit helps us in our weakness'
does nOt refer
something the Holy Spirit does apart from US and on our behalf;
but rather something the Holy Spirit does in cooperation with us:
The verb Paul uses here (sunantilambanomai) is also used in Luke
10.40, where Martha wants Jesus [0 tell
"to help me
certainly she does nOt want Mary
do the food preparation instead
but rather t0 come and take part with her in doing it:
Therefore Paul is nOt
about
something
the Holy Spirit does
completely apart from Our participation, but something the Holy
Spirit does in cooperation with our activity.
These reasons combine t0 indicate that Paul
not
talking about
work of the Holy Spirit done apart from us and unknown by uS
but
about the inarticulate sighs and groans which we ourselves utter in
prayer; which the Holy Spirit then makes into effective intercession
before the throne of God
We could paraphrase_
The Holy
assists OUI prayers when he intercedes (fOr US) by taking our
wordless groans and
them into effective prayer:"
What is the relationship between this and speaking
tongues?
There
some
similaricy because

making
pray even though we do not understand fully what we are praying
But there are some differences in that the sighs 0r groans that we
utter in prayer
often relate t0 situations or hardships that we
are very conscious of in Our minds as we pray; SO we know what we
are praying about. But Paul says that we d not know how
pray
for these situations as we ought to pray Therefore the Holy Spirit
helps us and intercedes in these situations
"according
[O the will of
God" (Rom: 8.27)_
There is no explicit mention of our spirit
praying (though that may indeed be true as well), nor is there
mention of Our mind being unfruitful or lacking understanding
(though that may at times be at least partially true)
Nor do these
sighs or groans come forth in
anything that could be called
other
tongues'
other languages_
So there are several differences_
pven
though Romans 8.26-27 talks about intercession that we make
in sounds that are not fully understood by uS
and therefore it is
phenomenon that has some similarities to speaking in tongues:

Paul writes,
For to one is given the word of wisdom through the
Spirit; and to another the word of knowledge
according
the same
Spirit" (1 Cor: 12.8 NASB) At the beginning of this discussion it
must be understood that these [WO
are mentioned nowhere else
in Scripture_
and no other early Christian literature outside the
Bible has been found to use these phrases of any spiritual gift
either: This means that the only information we have about these
gifts is contained in this verse: we have the words used tO describe
these tWo gifts_
and we have the context in which the phrases occuI:
No interpreter
anywhere has any more information than this
work with.
This warns US that our conclusions will probably be
somewhat tentative in any case
The major alternatives for understanding these gifts are two: (1)
These gifts are commonly thought to be the ability to receive
special revelation from the Holy Spirit and on that basis t0 speak
words that give wisdom in
situation Or give specific knowledge of
situation in the life of someone present in
congregation. In this
interpretation these gifts would be more
miraculous_
in that they
would call forth wonder and amazement from the people present
since they would not be based on information ordinarily available
the person using the gift
very
gifts .
The other interpretation of these gifts would see them as more
'non-miraculous
ordinary: the
word of wisdom" simply means
the ability to speak
wise word in various situations
and
word of
knowledge'
is the ability to speak with knowledge about a
situation_
In both cases the knowledge and wisdom would not be
based on
special revelation spontaneously given by the Holy
Spirit; but would be based on wisdom acquired in the ordinary
course of life, the knowledge and wisdom that would be
characteristic of Bible teachers 0r elders and other mature
Christians in
church, for example. These would be empowered by
the Holy Spirit and thereby made effective when
were
spoken
Examples of
words of wisdom" in this sense would be found in
Acts 6.1-6 (the appointment of the first
deacons'
or' assistants t0
the apostles); Acts 6.10 ( Stephen
wisdom in
proclaiming the
gospel); Acts 15.19-29 (the decision of the Jerusalem council); and
evem
Solomon'$ statement; "Divide the living child in two
and give half to the one_
and half t0 the other"
Kings 3.25; see
also
Cor: 6.5-6).
In favor of the first interpretation, it might be argued that all the
other seven gifts listed in
Corinthians 12.8-10 are in the
"miraculous'
category; and therefore these [Wo gifts should be
understood that way as well:
However; there are some weighty considerations against this view:
The words Paul uses for
word" (logos), "wisdom
(sophia),
and "knowledge
(gnosis) are not specialized 0r technical terms
but are extremely common words in the Greek
Testament
They are simply the ordinary words frequently used for
word" and
"wisdom" and "knowledge:
Moreover;
are not ordinarily used
denote miraculous events (as are the words revelation and
prophecy, for example), but are simply the words used for human
knowledge and wisdom:
So from the meanings of the words
themselves_
indication of
miraculous gift seems to be given
(2) In the context of
Corinthians 12.8
Paul $ purpose in the
argument seems t0 weigh
thinking of them as miraculous:
Paul's larger purpose
verses 8-10 is t0 demonstrate that no
matter what kind 0f gift
person has, he 0r she can be assured that
that gift has been given by the Holy Spirit He precedes the section
by saying; "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the
common
good,
and follows this immediate section by saying; "AII
they
King
New
they
against _
these are
inspired by one and the same Spirit; who apportions t0
each one individually as he wills" (vv: 7, 11) But if Paul's purpose
in this section is to show that every Christian $ gift is given by the
Holy Spirit, then that purpose would not be well served by giving
only examples of miraculous gifts. If he did that; those with non-
miraculous gifts would feel left out of the argument and would not
be persuaded that their gifts are included in Paul's discussion: Even
more importantly; those with miraculous gifts might look at this list
and conclude that only those with miraculous gifts really had the
Holy Spirit at work within them to empower those gifts. This would
lead t0
dangerous kind of elitism in the congregation_
Therefore ic
seems necessary that Paul would include some nonmiraculous gifts
in his list in
Corinthians 12.8-10.
But which are the nonmiraculous gifts in this list?
Word of wisdom
Word of
knowledge
Faith
Gifts of healings
Miracles
Prophecy
Distinguishing between spirits
Tongues
Interpretation of tongues
All the other gifts seem tO fall in the more
miraculous
category (with the
possible exceptions of speaking in tongues and perhaps faith) But that would
make it almost necessary that word of wisdom and word of knowledge be
nonmiraculous t0 guarantee that there
some nonmiraculous gifts in the list:
This would demonstrate Paul'$ pastoral wisdom in
selecting examples of
different kinds of gifts being exercised in the actual congre
So there
must be some nonmiraculous gifts on the list
and
there are some_
then
these are very good candidates _
Ore
'gation.
Probably the most decisive consideration
the fact that the
New Testament already has
term t0 describe the action of
receiving
special revelation from the
Spirit and reporting
in the
congregation
this is what Paul calls
'prophecy:
Since he
discusses prophecy at some length, describing
and regulating
we can know fairly clearly what prophecy was
But t0 say that these
other gifts functioned in exactly the same way (perhaps
differing
only in content) does not seem justified by anything in the text
other than
preconceived notion of what these gifts should be
Therefore
would seem preferable to understand these in a
nonmiraculous
way; simply as the ability t0 speak with wisdom
or with knowledge in various situations_
What many people [oday
call "word of wisdom
and
word of knowledge
in charismatic
circles_
would seem better simply t0 refer t0 as
prophecy:'

The gift of distinguishing between spirits is another gift that is
mentioned only once in the New Testament (in the list at
Cor:
12:10), but the nature
this gift connects it with
number ot other
passages that describe the spiritual
warfare that occurs between
Christians and demonic spirits.
We may define the
gift of
distinguishing between spirits as follows: Distinguishing between
spirits is
special ability to recognize the influence of the
Spirit or of demonic spirits in
person:
In the perspective of the history of redemption, this gift also gives
foretaste of the age to come in that it is
foretaste of the ability t0
recognize Satan and his influence_
which ability will be made
perfect for US in heaven, when everything that
covered or hidden
will be revealed and brought to the light (Matc: 10.26; cf. Rev:
20.11-15).
This ability is probably also stronger than that possessed
by most Or all believers in the old covenant; where mentions of
demonic activity are infrequent; and where demonic attacks against
God's people most often were embodied in military attacks by
unbelieving nations against the people of Israel, or in overt
temptations
go and serve pagan deities_
Demonic activily
Wds
therefore perceived primarily through observation of outward
physical events and circumstances in which Satan
purpose was
carried ouL; and which could be clearly seen:
Holy
Holy
This New Testament gift of distinguishing between spirits involves
the ability to distinguish the presence of evil spirits from the
presence of the work of the Holy Spirit in
person's life. Paul
knows that the Corinthians previously were "led astray to dumb
idols"
(1 Cor: 12.2), and John similarly realizes that there is
need
for Christians t0 "test the spirits [0 see whether they are of God; for
many false prophets have gone out into the world"
John 4.1).
Beyond this, it is also possible that the gift would involve
distinguishing between various types of evil spirits_
such as
spirit
of infirmity (Luke 13.11),
spirit of divination (Acts 16.16),
dumb and deaf spirit (Mark 9.25,29), and
spirit of error (1 John
4.6). From
lexical and grammatical standpoint there is nothing
that would prevent us from understanding the gift of
distinguishing between spirits'
to include this kind of ability as
well:
Of course, t0 some
degree the presence of demonic activity is
outwardly evident; sometimes from the blurting Out of blatantly
false doctrina
statements (see
Cor: 12.2-3;
John 4.1-6), and
sometimes from violent and bizarre physical actions, especially in
the face of Christian
preaching (see Mark 1:24; 9.20; Matt: 8.29;
etc.) Satan' $ influence is characteristically destructive, and the
person influenced by
demon will have
destructive influence on
the church and others around him 0r her; and also
self-destructive
influence that harms the life of the troubled individual himself or
herself:
But in addition t0 these outward indications of demonic influence
there
probably also
more subjective perception that occurs at
the spiritual and emotional level, whereby the presence of demonic
activity
distinguished. When this is more highly developed, and
is able t0 function for the benefit of the church as
whole, then
Paul would no doubt call it a gift of distinguishing between
spirits_
In connection with the gift of distinguishing between spirits
the
discussion of spiritual warfare given above in chapter 20 (on Satan
and demons) is also relevant:

Chapter 54
The Return of Christ: When and How?
When and how will Christ return? Could he come back at any
hour?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
As we begin the final
unit of this book, we turn
consider events
that
happen in the future. The study of future events
often
called
eschatology;
from the Greek word eschatos_
which means
"last.
The study of
eschatology; then, is the study of "the last
things_
Unbelievers can make reasonable predictions about future events
based on patterns of past occurrences, but in the nature of human
experience it is clear that human beings of themselves cannot know
the fucure_
Therefore unbelievers can have no certain
knowledge of
any future event: But Christians who believe the Bible are in a
different situation. Although
Lammol
know everything about the
future; God knows everything about the future and he has in
Scripture told us about the major events yet t0 come in the history
of the universe_
About these events occuring we can have absolute
confidence because God is never wrong and never lies_
Regarding
our wn personal
future as individuals,
we nave
already
discussed the teaching of Scripture in chapter 41 (on death and the
intermediate state) and chapter 42 (on glorification) The study of
these future events that will happen t0 individuals
sometimes
called
personal eschatology:
But the Bible also talks about
certain major events that will affect the entire universe. Specifically;
it tells us about the second coming of Christ, the millennium; the
final judgment; eternal punishment for unbelievers and eternal
reward for believers_
and life with God in the new heaven and new
earth: The study of these events is sometimes called
general
eschatology:
In this chapter we will study the question of the
return of
Christ, or his
second coming
Subsequent chapters will
Will
deal with the
remaining topics in
study of the last
There have been many debates
often heated ones
-in the
of the church over questions regarding the future
In this chapter we
will begin with aspects of Christ'$ second
with which all
evangelicals agree_
and then at the end move t0 one matter of
disagreement: whether Christ could return atany time. Then in the
following chapter
will discuss the question of the millennium;
topic that has long been
source of disagreement among Christians.

Jesus often
about his retumn:
You also must be ready:
for the
Son of Man is
atan hour you do not expect" (Matt 24.44).
He said,
will come
and will take You t0 myself, that where
Tam yOu may be also
(John 14.3). Immediately after Jesus had
ascended into heaven; [WO
angels said to the disciples, "This Jesus_
who was taken up from yOu into heaven;
come in the same way
as YOu saw him go into heaven
(Acts 1:11). Paul taught;
The Lord
himself will descend from heaven with
cry of command, with the
archangel
call; and with the sound of the trumpet of God"
Thess. 4.16). The author of Hebrews wrote that Christ "will appear
second time, not t0 deal with sin but t0 save those who are eagerly
for him" (Heb. 9.28). James wrote, "the
of the
Lord is at hand" (James 5.8). Peter said, "The day of the Lord
come like
thief" (2 Peter 3.10). John wrote, "when he appears we
shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is"
John 3.2). And
the book ot Revelation has frequent references
Christ'$ retum;
ending with Jesus' promise; "Surely
coming soon,
and John $
response;
Amen. Come;
Lord Jesus! " (Rev: 22.20).
This theme, then, is frequently mentioned throughout the New
Testament. It is the dominant hope of the New Testament church:
These verses predict
sudden retum of Christ that will be dramatic
and visible ("He is
with the clouds_
and every eye will see
him;
Rev: 1:7). The passages are far too explicit to allow the idea
(once
popular in liberal Protestant circles) that Christ himself will
not return, but simply that the spirit of Christ, meaning an
acceptance of his teaching and an imitation of his lifestyle of love,
would increasingly return t0 the earth: It is not his teachings or his
style of conduct; but "the Lord himself" who will descend from
things.

heaven (1 Thess. 4.16). It is Jesus himself "who was taken up from

who
will come in the same way as YOu saw him

(Acts 1:11). His appearing will not be

the end of Revelation should characterize
Christians' hearts in all
Amen:
Come,
Lord Jesus!" (Rev:
22.20). True Christianity trains us "to live sober; upright; and godly
lives in this world, awaiting our blessed
the appearing of the
glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ'
(Titus 2.12-13).
Paul says
our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await
Savior; the Lord Jesus Christ" (Phil. 3.20).
The term
Maranatha"
Corinthians 16.22 (NASB) similarly means; "Our Lord,
comel" (1 Cor: 16.22 RSV)
Do Christians in fact eagerly long for Christ'$ return? The more
Christians are caught up in enjoying the good things of this life, and
the more they neglect genuine Christian fellowship and their
personal relationship with Christ; the less
will long for his
return. On the other hand, many Christians who are experiencing
suffering Or persecution; Or who are more elderly and infirm; and
those whose daily walk with Christ is vital and deep, will have
more intense longing for his return. To some
extent; then, the
degree
which
actually long for Christ'$ return is
measure of
the spiritual condition of Our Own lives at the moment It also gives
some measure of the degree t0 which we see the world as it really
as God sees it, in bondage to sin and rebellion against God_
and
in the power of the evil one ( 1 John 5.19).
But does this mean that we should not undertake
term
projects? If
scientist who is
Christian eagerly longs for Christ'$
return, then should he or she begin
ten-year research project? Or
should
Christian begin
Three

theological
seminary 0r
Bible college? What if Christ were to return the day
before graduation

precisely for this reason that Jesus does not allow uS
know the
actua_
time of his return (see below): he wants LS t0 be engaged in
obedience to him; no matter what our walk of life, up until the
moment of his return. To "be ready'
for Christ'$ return (MatL.
24.44) is to be faithfully obeying him in the present; actively
engaged in whatever work he has called us t0_
In the nature of the
situation, since we do not know when he will return, on that day
there will no doubt be some missionaries just
departing for the
mission field,
who will never reach their destination: There
some men in their last year of seminary education who will never

(Matt_ 25.21).
When Chriat Will Returm
Severa)
passages indicate that we do not; and cannot; know the time
when Christ will return "The Son of man is coming at an hour YOU
d0 nol expect'
(Matt: 24.44). "Watch therefore, for you know
neither the day nor the hour"
(Matt: 25.13). Moreover; Jesus said,
"But of that day or that hour nO one knows,
MuLeven
the angels
heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father: Take heed, watch; for YOu
do not know when the time will come
(Mark 13.32-33).
It is simply an evasion of the force of those passages
say that we
cannot know the day 0r the hour; but that we can know the month
the year: The fact remains that Jesus is
at an hour you
do not expect" (Matt: 24.44), and
at an
unexpected hour" (Luke
12.40). (In these verses the word "hour" [hora] is best understood
more
general sense; tO refer to the time when
something will
take place_
not necessarily
sixty-minute period of time.)' The
point of these passages is that Jesus is telling US that we cannot
know when he is
back: Since he will come at an unexpected
time_
we should be ready at all times for him tO return:
The practical result of this is that anyone who claims to know
specifically when Jesus is coming back is automatically to be
considered wrong:

predictions of specific dates for Christ' =

turned out [0 be wrong
But others in the
ot the church
have made
predictions as well, sometimes
new
insight into biblical prophecies_
and sometimes
claiming -
to have
received personal revelations from Jesus himself indicating the time
of his return. It is unfortunate that many people have been deceived
by these claims; because if people are convinced that Christ will
return (for example) within
month, they will begin t0 withdraw
from all
term commitments
will take their children out
of school, sell their houses, quit their jobs, and give up work on any
~term projects whether in the church or elsewhere: They may
initially have an increased zeal for
evangelism and prayer; but the
unreasonable nature of their behavior will offset any evangelistic
impact they may have.
Moreover;
are simply
disobeying the
teaching of Scripture that the date of Christ'
return cannot be
known, which means that even their prayer and fellowship with
God will be hindered as well. Anyone who claims to know the date
on which Christ will retur
from whatever source
-should be
rejected as incorrect:
AlI Evangelicals Agree 0n the Final Results of Christ'$ Return
No matter what their differences on the details; all Christians who
take the Bible as their final authority agree that the final and
ultimate result of Christ'$ return will be the judgment of unbelievers
and the final reward of believers, and that believers will live with
Christ in
new heaven and
new earth for all eternity. God the
Father; Son, and Holy Spirit will reign and will be worshiped in
never-ending kingdom with no more sin Or SOrTOw Or"

We
will discuss these details more fully in the following chapters.

One of the significant areas of disagreement is over the question of
whether Christ could retum at any time. On the one hand, there are
many passages encouraging US tO be ready because Christ will
return ar an hour we d0 not expect: On the other hand_
there are
several passages that speak of certain events that will happen before
Christ returns.
There have been different ways of
resolving
the
apparent tension between these two sets of passages_
with some
Christians
concluding that Christ could still return at any time; and
others
concluding that he could not return for at least
generation,
since
would rake that

that muSt occur before his return_

What shall
we say t0 these
passages? If there were no passages in
the New Testament about signs that would precede Christ $ return;
we would probably conclude from the passages just quoted that
Jesus could come at any moment: In this sense, we can say that
Christ' $ retum is imminent
It would seem t0 blunt the force of the
commands [0 be ready and
watch if there
reason
think
that Christ would not come soon_
Before we look at passages on signs that precede Christ's coming
another problem must be considered at this point. Were Jesus and
the New 'Testament authors wrong
their expectation that he
would return soon? Did
not think and even teach that the
second coming of Christ would be in just
few years? In
very prominent view among liberal New Testament scholars has
been that Jesus mistakenly taught that he would return soon_
But none of the texts just quoted require this interpretation: The
texts that say to be ready do not say how long we will have to wait,
nor do the texts that say that Jesus is
time we do not
expect.
As for the texts that say Jesus is coming
soon;
we muSL
realize that biblical prophets often speak in terms of
prophetic
foreshortening_
which sees future events but does not see the
intervening time before those events occur:
George Ladd says:
The prophets were little interested in
chronology; and the future was
always viewed as imminent
the Old Testament prophets blended
the near and the distant perspectives SO as [0 fOrm
single canvas_
Biblical prophecy is not primarily three-dimensional but two; it has
height and breadth but is little concered about depth,

iC

transparency of the immediate. It is tnue that the early church lived in
expectancy of the retum of the Lord, and it is the nature of biblical
prophecy to make it possible for every generation t0 live in
expectancy of the end
Peter also reminds US that the Lord has
different perspective on
time than we do, So that
soon'
with him may not be what we
expect: "But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord
one day is as
thousand years _
and
thousand years as one day.
The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness'
Peter 3.8-9).
2. Signs That Precede Christ'$ Return: The other set of texts to be
considered tells of several signs that Scripture says will precede the time of
Christ'
retum_
Berkhof says,
According -
Scripture several
important events
occur before the return of the Lord, and therefore it
cannor be called imminent
Here it will be helpful to list those passages that most directly refer
signs that must occur before Christ'$ return.
The
Preaching of the Gospel to All Nations:
And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
(Mark 13.10; cf:
Matt: 24.14)
The Great Tribulation:
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars_
do nor be alarmed; this
must take place; but the end is not yet For nation will rise against
nation;
and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in
various places; there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the
birth-pangs. (Mark 13.7-8; cf. Matt 24.15-22; Luke 21.20-24)
For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the
beginning

And if the Lord had not shortened the

to lead astray; if possible, the elect: (Mark 13.22; cf. Matt.

d. Signs in the Heavens:
But in those days, after Ihat tribulation, the sun

the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from
heaven; and the powers in the heavens will be shaken: And then
will see the Son of man
in clouds with great power and glory:
(Mark 13.24-25; cf. Matt. 24.29-30; Luke 21.25-27)
The
of the Man of Sin and the Rebellion: Paul writes t0 the
Thessalonians that Christ will not come unless the man of sin is first revealed,
and then the Lord Jesus will destroy him at his coming: This
man of sin" is
sometimes identified with the beast in Revelation 13,
and is sometimes called
the antichrist; the final and worst of the series of
antichrists'
mentioned in
John 2.18_
Paul writes:
Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
that day will
o[ come_
unless the rebellion comes first; and the man of lawlessness is
revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against
every SO-called god or object of worship
that he takes his seat in [he
temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
And you know what
is restraining
now SO that he may be revealed in his time. For the
mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who nOW restrains it
will do s0 until he is out of the way. And then the lawless one will be
revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth
and destroy him by his appearing and his coming: The coming of the
lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power
with
pretended signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those
who are t0 perish, because they refused to love the truth and s0 be
saved_
(2 Thess. 2:1-10)
f. The Salvation of Israel: Paul talks about the fact that many Jews have not
trusted in Christ, but he says that sometime in the
large number
would be saved:
Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure
means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion
mean! (Rom: 11.12)

thus all Israel will be saved (Rom 11:25-26)
Conclusions From These Signs That Precede Christ'$ Return: The
impact of these passages seems S0 clear that, as was mentioned above, many
Christians have felt that Christ simply cannot return at any moment.
As we
look over the list of signs given above, it would not seem t0 take much
argument to demonstrate that most of these events
perhaps all of them;
have not yet occurred
Or at least that is what appears to be the case on
firsc
reading of these passages.
3. Possible Solutions
How can
reconcile the passages that seem to warn
uS to be ready because Christ could suddenly return, with passages that
indicate that several important and visible events must take place before
Christ can retum? Several solutions have been proposed
One solution is t0 say that Christ could not come at any time
This
position is taken by Louis Berkhof; in the sentence quoted above
Just how long
would be before Christ would return depends on
each person"
estimate of how
it will take some of the signs t0
be fulfilled
such as the preaching of the gospel to all nations_
the
coming of the great tribulation, and the ingathering of the full
number of the Jews who will be saved:
The difficulty with this view
twofold. First, it really seems t0
nullify the force of the warnings of Jesus that we should watch
ready; and that he is returning atan hour we do not expect: What
force is there in
warning t0 be ready for Christ tO come
unexpected time when we know that this coming cannot occur fOr
many years? The sense of urgent expectancy of Christ'$ return is
greatly diminished or denied altogether in this position, and that
result seems quite contrary
Jesus
intention in giving these
wamnings.
Second
this position seems t0 use these signs in
way quite
opposite from the way Jesus intended them
be used
The signs
given SO that; when we see them_
they will intensify our
expectation of Christ'
return. Jesus said, "Now when these things
begin t0 take place
look up and raise your heads_
because your
redemption is drawing near
(Luke 21.28). And the warnings are
also given t0
believers from going astray and
following false
long
keep
messiahs: "Take heed that no one leads YOu astray. Many will come
my name, saying;
am hel ' and they will lead many astray:
And then if any one says [0 YOu,
Look; here is the Christ! ' or
Look; there he is!' do not believe it" (Mark 13.5-6, 21).
So the
signs are given to keep Christians from being surprised by these
remarkable events, t0 assure them that God knows them all in
advance_
and t0
them from
following after alleged messiahs
who d not come in the dramatic,
visible
world-conquering way in
which Jesus himself will come.
But the signs
nevei
given t0
make us think,
Jesus couldn t come for
few years:
There is no
indication that Jesus gave these signs in order t0 provide Christians
with
reason not t0 be ready for his return Or in order t0 encourage
them not
expect that he could come at any timel To use the signs
that will precede Christ'$ return in this way (as Berkhof does, for
example), is tO use them in
way that Jesus never intended
Therefore
does not seem convincing t0 say that Christ could not
come at any time.
The other major solution t0 this problem is t0 say that Christ indeed
come at any time_
and t0 reconcile the Iwo sets of passages in
various ways
One way [0 reconcile them is tO say that the New
Testament talks about Iwo distinct returns of Christ; O1 LWo second
comings of Christ;
that is_
secret coming at which Christ takes
Christians OUC of the world (a
"for his saints"_
and then;
after seven years of tribulation have occurred on the earth;
visible,
public , triumphant coming
coming
with his saints
in which
Christ comes t0 reign over the earth: During the seven-year interval
all the signs that have not yet been fulfilled (the great tribulation,
the false prophets with signs and wonders, the antichrist, the
salvation of Israel, and the signs in the heavens)
be fulfilled, so
that there is no tension at all between
coming that
could occur
at any moment"
and realizing that
later coming Will
be preceded by many signs_
The problem with this solution is that it is hard t0 derive tWO
separate comings of Christ from the passages that predict his retum

not discuss this matter here, but will treat it in the
next
chapter; when considering the pretribulational premillennial
view of Christ' $ return.
should also be noted that this solution is

church before

Darby (1800-1882). This should alert us to the fact that this
solution is not the only possible one to the tension presented by the
passages quoted above
Another solution is t0 say that all the signs have been fulfilled,
and therefore Christ
fact could return at any moment On this
view; one could look for possible fulfillments of these signs in the
events of the early church; even in the first century: In some sense
might be said, the gospel
was indeed preached t0 all nations, false
prophets arose and opposed the gospel, there was great tribulation
in the persecution the church suffered at the hands of some of the
Roman emperors, the man of lawlessness was in fact the emperor
Nero, and the full number of the Jewish people who are t0 be saved
has gradually come about through the history of the church; since
Paul even gives himself as one example of the
beginning of this
ingathering of the Jewish people (Rom_
11:1). We will discuss in
more detail
the following section the view that the signs
preceding Christ'$ return might have already been fulfilled;
buc
here we can simply note that many people have not found
convincing any view saying that they have happened, because these
signs seem t0 them to point to much
larger events than those that
occurred in the first century:
There is another possible way of resolving these tWO sets of
passages. It is t0 say that it is unlikely but possible that the signs
have already been fulfilled, and therefore we simply cannot know
with certainty at any point in history whether all the signs have
been fulfilled or not: This position
an attractive one because it
takes seriously the primary purpose for the signs_
the primary
purpose for the warnings_
and the fact that we are not [0 know when
Christ will
return
With
to the signs; their primary purpose is
intensify our expectation of Christ'$ retum_
Therefore whenever
we see indications of
that resemble these signs, our
expectation of Christ'$ return will be aroused and intensified
With
regard
the warnings to be ready; advocates of this position would
say that Christ could retum
any time (since
we cannot be certain
that the signs have not been fulfilled), and so we must
be ready;
evem
though it is unlikely that Christ
return at once (because it
seems that there are several signs yet t0 be fulfilled) Finally, this
position agrees that we canno
know when Christ will return, and
that he is coming at an hour we do not expect
rCg-1d
things
will
But is it possible that these signs have been fulfilled? We can
examine them one at
time. In each case our conclusion will be
that it is unlikely; but possible; that the sign has been fulfilled
already:
The Preaching of the Gospel to All Nations: Has the gospeL
been
preached to all nations? Probably not; since there are many language groups
and tribes that have still never heard the gospel. It is unlikely; therefore; that
this sign has been fulfilled.
However; Paul does speak in Colossians about the
worldwide spread of the gospel. He speaks of
gospel which has come
You, as indeed in the whole world it is
fruit and growing'
(Col: 15
6) . He also
of "the gospel which you heard
which has been preached
every creature under heaven, and of which
Paul, became
minister"
(Col: 1.23). In these verses he certainly does not mean that every creature
alive has heard the proclamation of the gospel, but that the proclamation has
torth
the whole world and that; in a representative sense at least; the
gospel
has been preached t0 the whole world or to all nations
Therefore;
though, it is unlikely but possible that this sign was initially fulfilled in the
first century and has been fulfilled in
greater sense many times since then_
Great Tribulation: Once
seems
likely that the language of
Scripture indicates
period of suffering coming to the earth that is far greater
than anything that has yel
been experienced:
But
must be realized that many
people have understood Jesus' warnings about
tribulation t0 refer [0 the
Roman
of Jerusalem in the Jewish War of AD
66-70_
The suffering
during that war was indeed terrible
and could be whar was described by Jesus
predicting this tribulation.
since the first century; there have been
many periods of violent and intense persecution of Christians, and even in our
century much of it has occurred over
portions of the globe, with
Christians being horribly persecuted in the former Soviet Union, in
communist China; and in Muslim countries. It would be difficult t0 convince
some Christians in this century who have undergone decades of persecution
for their faith, and have known that persecution
affect thousands of other
Christians
throughout
segments of the world
that such
great
tribulation has certainly not yet occurred:
have longed and prayed for
years for Christ tO come and rescue them from the tribulation that they are
enduring:
Once again, though
may think that Jesus
words indicate the
likelihood of
greater persecution coming in the future, it is
difficult to be certain of this.

is unlikely but possible that the prediction of _

False Christs and False Prophets: With regard t0 the false christs and
false prophets who will work signs and wonders, any missionary who has
worked among people where witchcraft and demonic activity are rampant will
readily testify that seemingly miraculous
signs and wonders" have been
worked frequently by demonic power in opposition t0 the spread of the
gospel. Certainly demonic miracles and false signs have been done for
centuries
at least since the time that the magicians in Pharaoh'$ court
produced false signs in opposition to Moses
miracles (Ex 7:11; 8.7; cf: the
activity of Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8.9-11). Whatever the specific form it
takes, such working of deceptive miracles is almost always accompanied by
false religions, leading many people astray (leaders of such groups could be
called false messiahs and false prophets). It seems likely that Jesus

predict

this kind of activity in the time just prior
[O his return, but
it is difficult to be certain that this will be so. It is best
LO conclude that it is unlikely but still possible that this sign has been fulfilled
already:
Powerful Signs in the Heavens: The occurence of powerful signs in the
heavens is the one sign that almost certainly has not yet occurred Of course,
there have been eclipses of the sun and moon, and comets have appeared,
since the world began. But Jesus speaks of something far greater:
The sun
will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; and the stars will fall
from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken
(Matt: 24.29).
Although R T France attempts tO explain this as symbolic language that
refers t0 the destruction of Jerusalem and God'$ judgment on it,
he must
base this claim on the assertion that Isaiah 13.10 (from which Jesus
words in
Matt_ 24.29 seem
be drawn) is also merely symbolic language to refer t0
the fall of Babylon, whereas it is more likely that both Isaiah 13.10 and
Matthew 24.29 speak of
yet future literal
of the stars and
blackening
of the sun and moon, something that would be
suitable prelude t0 the
shaking of the earth and heaven and the cosmic destruction that will come
after the return of Christ (see Heb
1:10-12; 12.27; 2 Peter 3.10-11)
Moreover; it is significant that this description of cosmic events in Matthew
24.29 is followed in the rest of the sentence with the description of "the Son
of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (v 30).
Given these facts; it seems unlikely that the descriptions of the

within the space of

hour or tWO
t0 be followed immediately by Christ'$ return: These particular
signs are not the type that would
ead uS t0 deny that Christ could retum at
any time.
The Appearance of the Man of Lawlessness: Many attempts have been
made throughout history t0 identify the man of lawlessness (the
antichrist"
with historical figures who had great authority and brought havoc and
devastation among people on the earth
The ancient Roman emperors Nero
and Domitian_
both of whom severely persecuted Christians, were thought by
many
be the antichrist_ (Many Roman emperors
including these two_
claimed deity for themselves and demanded to be worshiped:) In more recent
times Adolf Hitler was commonly thought to be the antichrist; as was Joseph
Stalin:
Un the other hand_
many Protestants since the Reformation, especially
those who were persecuted by the Catholic Church; have thought that one or
another of the popes was the antichrist:
But all of these identifications have proved false,
and it is likely
that
yet worse
man of lawlessness-
will arise 0n the world scene
and bring unparalleled suffering and persecution, only to be
destroyed by Jesus when he comes
But the evil perpetrated
by many of these other rulers has been so great that; at least while
were in power;
would have been difficult to be certain that
the
man of lawlessness'
mentioned in 2 Thessalonians
has not
yet appeared_
Once
it is unlikely but possible that this sign
has been fulfilled.
The Salvation of Israel: With
the salvation of the fullness of
Israel, again it must be said that Romans 9-11 seems t0 indicate that there
will be
yet future massive ingathering of the Jewish people as
tumn t0
accept Jesus as their Messiah:
But it is not certain that Romans 9-IL predicts
this_
and many have argued that no further ingathering of the Jewish people
will occur beyond the kind that we have already seen through the history of
the church, since Paul gives himself as
primary example of this
ingathering
(Rom_
H1:1
2). Once

already been fulfilled:

return at any hour of the
O1 night: It is therefore unlikely but certainly
possible that Christ could retum at any time
But does this position do justice to the warnings that we should be
ready and that Christ is coming at
time we do not
expect? Is it
possible to be ready for something that we think unlikely to happen
the near future? Certainly it is. Everyone who wears

he or she thinks to be unlikely:
similar way it seems possible

and nonetheless t0 say that the signs
preceding
his coming will probably yet occur in the future
This position has positive spiritua_
benefits aS we seek to live the
Christian life in the midst of
rapidly changing world. In the ebb
and
of world history, we see from time tO time events that
could be the final fulfillment of some of these signs. They happen;
and then they fade away: During the blackest days of World War IL;
it seemed very likely that Hitler was the antichrist During times of
persecution
against the church; it can seem
MOIE

Christians are

When we hear
of earthquakes and famines and wars_
makes US wonder if the
coming of Christ might not be near: Then these events fade into the
background and world leaders pass off the scene, and the tide of
events leading t the end of the age seems to have receded for a
time_
Then once again
new wave of events will break on the
world scene, and once

which one will be the last: And this is good, because God does not

spiritually unhealthy for US tO say that we know that these signs
have not occuned, and

But
seems
tic exactly
the middle of the New Testament
approach toward Christ'$ return t0 say that we do not know with

are all three preserved in this position

QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Before reading this chapter; did yOu think that Christ could return at any
hour? How did that affect your Christian life? Now what do you think? If
your viewpoint has changed
what effect do you think it will have on
your own life?
Why do You think Jesus decided to leave the world for
time and then
return, rather than staying on earth after his resurection and
preaching
the gospel throughout the world himself?
Do you nOw eagerly
for Christ $ retum? Have YOu had
greater
longing for it in the past? If you do not have
very strong yearning for
Christ'$ return, what factors in your life do you think contribute to that
lack of longing?
Have You ever decided not t0 undertake
term project because yOu
thought Christ'$ return was near? Do you have any hesitancy now about
term projects because of that reason? If so, do you think that
hesitancy has any negative consequences on
life?
Are you ready for Christ tO return today? If you knew he were going to
return within 24 hours, what situations Or relationships would you want
straighten out before he retumed? Do yOu think that the command to
"be ready" means that you should attempt t0 straighten out those things
nOw; even
You think it unlikely that he would return today?

Chapter 55
The Millennium
What is the millennium? When does it occur? Will Christians go
through the Great Tribulation?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The word millennium means
one thousand years'
(from Lat:
millennium; "thousand years'
The term comes from Revelation
20.4-
where
says that certain people
came
life, and reigned
with Christ
thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come tO
life until the thousand years were ended_
Just prior t0 this
stalement;
read that an angel
came down from heaven and
seized the devil
and bound him for
thousand years, and threw
him into the pit; and shut it and sealed it over him, that he should
deceive the nations nO more_
till the thousand years were ended"
(Rev: 20.2-3)
Throughout the history of the church there have been three major
views On the time and nature of this
millennium.
Exuhanation of tlz Thrt
Victar
Amillennialism: The first view to be explained here, amillennialism; is
really the simplest: It can be pictured as in figure 55.1:
ANILLENNIAVSN

Fiyure 55.
Naret
According
this position the passage in Revelation 20:1-10
describes the present church age. This is an age in which Satan'$
influence over the nations has been greatly reduced s0 that the
gospel can be preached to the whole world_
Those who are said [0
be reigning with Christ fOr the thousand years are Christians who
have died and are already reigning with Christ in heaven_
Christ'$
reign in the millennium; according t0 this view; is nOt
bodily reign
here on earth but rather the heavenly reign he
of when he
said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given t0 me
(Matt. 28.18).
This view is called
amillennial" because
maintains that there is
no future millennium yet tO come. Since amillennialists believe that
Revelation 20 is nOw being fulfilled in the church age
they hold
that the
millennium
described there
curently happening:
The
exact duration of the church age cannot be known; and the
expression "thousand years
is simply
figure of speech for
long
period of time in which God'$ perfect purposes will be
accomplished
According
this position, the present church age will continue
until the time of Christ'$ retum (see figure 55.1). When Christ
returns_
there will be
resurrection of both believers and
unbelievers- The bodies of believers will rise t0 be reunited with
their spirits and enter into full enjoyment of heaven forever:
Unbelievers will be raised t0 face the final judgment and eternal
condemnation. Believers will also stand before the judgment seat of
Christ (2 Cor: 5.10) , but this judgment
only determine degrees
of reward in heaven; for only unbelievers will be condemned
eterally At this time also the new heavens and new earth will
begin. Immediately after the final judgment, the eternal state will
commence and continue forever:
This scheme
quite simple because all of the end time events
happen at once, immediately after Christ $ retum. Some
amillennialists say that Christ could return at any time_
while others
(such as Berkhof) argue that certain signs have yet to be fulfilled.
2. Postmillennialism: The prefix post- means
after:
According to this view;
Christ will return after the millennium. The postmillennial view may be
represented as in figure 55.2.

of this period, Christ will return t0 earth; believers and unbelievers

POSTHILLENNIRLISM
Fiuure 55.2
The primary characteristic of postmillennialism is that it is very
optimistic about the power of the gospel to change lives and bring
about much
in the world
Belief in postmillennialism tends to
increase
times when the church is experiencing
revival,
when there is an absence of war and international conflict; and
when
appears that great progress is being made in overcoming the
evil and suffering in the world. But postmillennialism in its most
responsible form is not based simply on the observation of events in
the world around us, but on arguments from various Scripture
passages, which will be examined below:
3. Premillennialism:
Classic or Historic Premillennialism: The prefix
pre -
means
~before;
and the "premillennial" position says that Christ will come back before the
millennium_
This viewpoint has
long history from the earliest centuries
onward. It may be represented aS in figure 55.3.
According
this viewpoint; the present church age will continue
until, as it nears the end,
time of great tribulation and
suffering
will
long
will
good
great
comes on the earth (T in the figure above stands for tribulation).
After that time of tribulation at the end of the church age, Christ
will return t0 earth to establish
millennial kingdom When he
comes
believers who have died will be raised from the dead,
their bodies will be reunited with their spirits, and these believers
will reign with Christ on earth for one thousand years:
Some
premillennialists take this to be
literab
one thousand years, and
others understand
symbolic expression for
period of
time
During this time
Christ will be physically present on the
earth in his resurrected body; and will reign as
over the entire
earth: The believers who have been raised from the dead_
and those
who were on earth when Christ returns
will receive glorified
resurection bodies that will never die, and in these resurrection
bodies
will live on the earth and reign with Christ. Of the
unbelievers who remain on earth, many (but not all) will turn to
Christ and be saved. Jesus will reign in perfect righteousness and
there will be peace throughout the earth: Many premillennialists
hold that the earth will be renewed and we will in fact see the new
heavens and new earth at this time (but it is not essential to
premillennialism
hold to this, for one could be
premillennialist
and hold that the new heavens and new earth will nOr occur until
after the
judgment) At the beginning of this time Satan will be
bound and cast into the bottomless pit SO that he will have no
influence on the earth

premillennialism has tended to increase in popularity

and as

But; as in the case of
postmillennialism,
the arguments for the premillennial position are not based on an
observation of cunent events_
but on specific passages of Scripture_
especially (but not exclusively) Revelation 20.1-10.
Pretribulational Premillennialism (or Dispensational
Premillennialism): Another variety of premillennialism has
widespread popularity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, particularly
in the United Kingdom and the United States. According to this position,
Christ will return not only before the millennium
Christ' $ retum is
premillennial) , but also it will occur before the great tribulation (Christ'$
return is pretribulational)_
position
similar t0 the classica
premillennial position mentioned above_
but with one important difference: it
will add another return of Christ before his return [O reign on earth in the
millennium: This return is thought to be
secret return of Christ t0 take
believers out of the world:
The pretribulational premillennial view may be
represented as in figure 55.4.
According
this view, the church age
continue until, suddenly;
unexpectedly, and secretly; Christ will return part way [0 earth, and
then will call believers to himself: "The dead in Christ will rise
first; then we who
alive
who are left; shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
Thess_
4.16-17).
Christ will then return to heaven with the
believers who have been removed from the earth When that
happens, there will be
great tribulation on the earth for
period
of seven years_
During this seven-year period of tribulation, many of the signs that
were
predicted to precede Christ'$ return will be fulfilled:
The
great ingathering of the fullness of the Jewish
will occur; as
they trust Christ as their Messiah: In the midst of great suffering
there will also be much effective evangelism; especially carried out

people
by the new Jewish Christians_
At the end of the tribulation, Christ
will then come back with his saints t0 reign On the earth for one
thousand years. After this millennial period there will be
rebellion, resulting in the final defeat of Satan and his forces_
and
then will come the resurrection of unbelievers, the last judgment;
and the beginning of the eternal state:

PRETRBOLAMOAACPRDAILCDAAMALA
Fiyure 55.4
One further characteristic of pretribulational premillennialism
should be mentioned: This view
found almost exclusively among
dispensationalists who wish t0 maintain
clear distinction between
the church and Israel. This pretribulationab
viewpoint allows the
distinction t0 be maintained, since the church
taken out of the
world before the widespread conversion of the Jewish people:
These Jewish people therefore remain
distinct group from the
church Another characteristic of pretribulational premillennialism
is its insistence 0n interpreting biblical prophecies "literally where
possible_
This especially applies t0 prophecies in the Old
Testament concerning Israel. Those who hold this view argue that
those prophecies of God $ future blessing t0 Israel
will yet be
fulfilled among the Jewish people themselves; they are not to be
"spiritualized" by finding their fulfillment in the church: Finally;
one attractive feature about pretribulational premillennialism is that
it allows people to insist that Christ'$ return could occur
at any
moment" and therefore does justice
the full force of the passages
that encourage 4S t0 be ready for Christ'$ return; while it still allows
for
very literal fulfillment of the signs preceding Christ'$ retum;
since it says these will come tO pass in the tribulation:
Before examining the arguments for these three (or four) positions,
it is important t0 realize that the interpretation of the details of
prophetic passages regarding future events is often
complex and
difficult task
involving many variable factors_
Therefore the
degree
certainty that attaches to OUr conclusions in this area will be less
than with many other doctrines. Even though
will argue for one
position (classical premillennialism),
also think it important for
evangelicals
recognize that this area
study is complex and [0
extend
large measure of grace [0 others who hold different views
regarding the millennium and the tribulation period
B.A Consideration of the Arguments for Amillennialism
In favor of the amillennial view, the
following arguments are
advanced:
When we look through the whole of the Bible, amillennialists
will say; only one passage (Rev: 20.1-6) appears t0 teach
future
earthly millennial rule of Christ, and that passage is itself obscure
is unwise 0 base such
major doctrine 0n one passage of
uncertain and widely disputed interpretation:
But how do amillennialists understand Revelation 20.1-6? The
amillennial interpretation sees this passage as referring t0 the
present church age. The passage reads as follows:
Then
saw an
angel coming down from heaven_
in his hand the
of the bottomless pit and
great chain.
And he seized the dragon
that ancient serpent; who is the Devil and Satan; and bound him for
thousand years, and threw him into the pit; and shut it and sealed it
over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand
years were ended
After that he must be loosed for
little
Then
saw thrones, and seated on them were those t0 whom judgment
was committed. Also
saw the souls of those who had been beheaded
for their testimony
Jesus and for the word of God
and who had nOL
worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on
their foreheads or their hands. They came t0 life, and reigned with
Christ
thousand years:
The rest of the dead did not come t0 life until
the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Blessed
and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the
second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of
Christ, and they shall reign with him
thousand years:
According
the amillennial
interpreration
the binding of Satan in
holding
Key
while.
Verses
1-2 is the binding that occurred during Jesus' earthly
ministry. He spoke of binding the strong man in order that he may
plunder his house (Matt: 12.29) and said that the Spirit of God was
at that time present in power t0 triumph over demonic forces: "[f it
is by the Spirit of God that
cast out demons
then the kingdom of
God has come upon you
(Matt: 12.28) . Similarly, with respect t0
the breaking of Satan'$ power; Jesus said
his ministry,
saw
Satan fall like lightning from heaven" (Luke 10.18)_
The amillennialist argues that this binding of Satan in Revelation
20:1-3 is for
specific purpose
"that he should deceive the nations
no more
(v 3) This is exactly what happened when Jesus came
and the gospel began to be proclaimed not simply to Jews but, after
Pentecost; t0 all the nations of the world_
In fact; the worldwide
missionary activity of the church; and the presence of the church in
mOSL OF
all of the nations of the world, shows that the power that
Satan had
the Old Testament; t0
deceive the nations'
and keep
them in darkness
has been broken:
On the amillennialist view the scene described in verse
occurs in
heaven: John said,
Sd
the souls of those who had been beheaded
for their testimony t0 Jesus_
They came to life_
and reigned with
Christ .
thousand years'
(v. 4). Since John sees
souls"
and not
physical bodies_
it is argued, this scene must be occurring in
heaven:
When the text says thar
They came t0 life" it does not
mean thar
received
bodily resurrection: It possibly means
simply that "they lived,
since the aorist verb ezesan can readily be
interpreted [0 be
statement of an event that occurred over
period of time: (The verb for "they reigned" is also an aorist
indicative and refers [0 an occurrence over
thousand years, s0 the
verb "they lived" should have
similar meaning:
On the other
hand, some amillenniaE
interpreters will take the verb ezesan to
mean
came to life" in the sense of coming into heavenly
existence in the presence of Christ and beginning
reign with him
from heaven:
According
this view; the phrase "first resurrection" (V 5) refers
going
heaven
be with the Lord This is not
bodily
resurrection but
coming into the presence of God
heaven_
similar way; when verse
says; "The rest of the dead did not come
life until the thousand
ears were ended;
"this is understood [0
mean they did not come into God's presence for judgment until the
during
they
long
"they
end of the thousand years
So in both verses
and 5, the phrase
come t0 life
means
come into the presence of God
(Another
amillennial view of "first resurrection"
is that it refers t0 the
resurrection of Christ; and to believers' participation in Christ'$
resurection through union with Christ )
A second argument often proposed in favor of amillennialism is
the fact that Scripture teaches only one resurrection, when both
believers and unbelievers
be raised, not tWO resurections (a
resurrection of believers before the
ennium begins, and
resurrection of unbelievers to judgment after the end of the
millennium). This is an important argument; because the
premillennial view requires two separate resurrections, separated by
thousand years_
Evidence in favor of only one resurection is found in at least three
passages. Jesus says;
hour
coming when all who are in the
Tombs
will hear his voice and come forth, those who have done
good,
to the resurrection of life
and those who have done evil; [0
the resurrection of
judgment" (John 5.28-29)_
Here Jesus speaks of
single "hour'
when both believing and unbelieving dead will
come forth from the tombs. Similarly; when Paul is on trial before
Felix he explains that he has
in God that his Jewish
opponents also accept "that there will be
resurrection of both the
and the unjust" (Acts 24.15). Once again, he speaks of
single
resurrection of both believers and unbelievers. Finally; we read in
Daniel:
And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake, some
everlasting life, and some
shame and everlasting
contempt" (Dan. 12.2).
The idea of glorified believers and sinners
on earth
together is too difficult to accept Berkhof says
"It is impossible t0
understand how
part of the old earth and of sinful humanity can
exist alongside
part of the new earth and of
humanity that is
glorified_
How can perfect saints in glorified bodies have
communion with sinners in the flesh? How can glorified sinners
live in this sin-laden atmosphere and amid scenes of death and
decay?"
If Christ comes in glory to reign on the earth, then how could
people still persist

resurrection body and reigning as King over the earth, does it not

There seems
be no

millennium:
Once the church age has ended and Christ has returned, then what
is the reason for delaying the start of the eternal state?
In conclusion, amillennialists say that Scripture seems
indicate
that all the major events Yet
come before the eternal state will
occur al once.
Christ will return, there will be one resurrection of
believers and unbelievers; the final judgment will take place, and
new heaven and new earth will be established Then
enter
immediately into the eternal state, with no future millennium:
At this point We
can respond briefly to these amillennialist
arguments, though on some points
fuller answer will be developed
in the arguments for premillennialism.
L.In response
the objection that only one passage teaches
future earthly millennium; several comments can be made:
The Bible only needs
say something once in order for it tO be
true and something that we must believe. The
of the confusion
languages at the tower of Babel, for example
is only taught in
Genesis 11.1-9, yet we believe it tO be true because Scripture
teaches it. Similarly; even if only one passage taught
future
millennial reign of Christ; we still should believe it:
Moreover; it is not surprising that this doctrine should be clearly
taught in the book of Revelation: There was somewhat of
similar
situation at the end of the Old Testament era.
The entire Old
Testament has no explicit
teaching to the effect that the Messiah
would come [wice_
once as
suffering Messiah who would die and
rise
earning our salvation, and then later as
conquering
King to rule over the earth: The first and second comings of Christ
may be hinted at in the Old Testament prophets, but they are
nowhere explicitly taught; because God did not deem it necessary
LO reveal that amount of detail about his plan of redemption before
happened. Similarly, in several of the Old and New Testament
books
leading up
the time of the writing of Revelation, there are
hints
future earthly millennium prior
the eternal
state_
but the
gather
against -
Will
story
again,
explicit teaching about
was left until John wrote Revelation.
Since Revelation is the New Testament book that most explicitly
reaches about things
future, it is appropriate that this more
explicit revelation of the future millennium would be put at this
point in the Bible:
b. In response t0 the
allegation that the passage that teaches
millennium is obscure; premillennialists respond that
do not
find it obscure at all. They argue that one advantage of the
premillennial position is that
understands Revelation 20.1-6 in a
straightforward sense: the text says that Satan will be bound and
cast into the bottomless pit for
thousand years
and the
premillennialist says
time is coming when Satan will be bound
and cast into
bottomless pit for a thousand years. The text speaks
thousand-year reign of Christ; and the premillennialist expects
future thousand-year reign of Christ on earth
Ic speaks of those
raised in the "first
esurrection;
and the premillennialist says that
there will be
first resurrection of believers who are "blessed and
holy" (Rev: 20.6) and
second resurection at the end of the
thousand years
for the rest of the dead" (v. 5). According to
premillennialists
obscurity
only enters the passage when an
interpreter tries tO find in it something other than such
straightforward interpretation_
Finally, many premillennialists argue that several other passages,
especially in the Old Testament; require US to believe in
future
period that is far greater than the present age but that still falls short
of the eternal state (see Ps. 72.8-14; Isa: 11.2-9; 65.20; Zech: 14.6
21;
Cor: 15.24; Rev 2.27; 12.5; 19.15).
These passages,
say, portray
period that looks
much like the millennium as
they understand i.
d. With respect to the interpretation of Revelation 20:1-6 as given
by amillennialists_
several difficulties arise. Although Matthew
12.28-29 and Luke 10.18 do speak of
~binding
of Satan during
Jesus' earthly ministry, the binding of Satan described in Revelation
20 seems to be much more extensive than that: The passage does
not simply say that Satan
bound at this time_
but speaks of "the
bottomless pit" and says that the angel that came down from heaven
"threw him into the pit, and shut
and sealed it over him, that he
should deceive the nations no more
till the thousand years were
ended" (Rev: 20.2-3). More than
mere binding Or restriction of
Fel _
they
they
very
activity is in view here
The imagery of throwing Satan into
and
shutting
and sealing it over him gives
picture of total
removal from influence on the earth: To say that Satan is nOw in a
bottomless pit that is shut and sealed over simply does not fit the
present
situation during the church age, in which Satan $
activity is still very strong; in which he
prowIs around like
lion_
someone [0 devour"
Peter 5.8) , in which he
can fill someone's heart "to lie to the Holy Spirit" (Acts 5.3), and in
which
what pagans sacrifice they offer t0 demons and not to God"
Cor: 10.20).
Moreover; even after the
of Satan
Jesus
ministry;
remains true that
of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelievers_
to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of
the glory of Christ" (2 Cor: 4.4).
This is why Christians still must
contend not "against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
against the powers; against the world rulers of this present darkness,
the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places'
(Eph: 6.12). This is because even
the church age, though the
gospel is able tO come with triumph and break down the forces of
demonic opposition tO the
of the kingdom of God,
nonetheless Satan's influence has not fully been removed from the
world:
The spirit of antichrist
is in the world already"
John
4.3), and, in fact; "We know that we are of God_
and the whole
world is in the power of the evil one
John 5.19). This repeated
theme in the New Testament; the theme of Satan's continual activity
earth throughout the church age, makes
extremely difficult to
think that Satan has been thrown into the bottomless pit; and it has
been shut and sealed over for
thousand years _
That imagery can
only speak of the total removal of Satan'
active influence from the
earth.
But what can be said with respect to the fact that amillennialists say
that the
binding and imprisonment of Satan in Revelation 20 is said
be "that he should deceive the nations no more
3)? Does that
not simply mean that the gospel can now be preached effectively
among the nations? While the phrase might mean
seems
more consistent with the use of the word deceived (Gk: planao),
especially in Revelation, to say that this is
deception that is now
going on during the entire church age and that ends only when the
millennium begins. Satan is called the one
who deceives the whole
world" (Rev: 12.9 NASB), and the sorcery of Babylon
said to
world
roaring
seeking
binding
during
"the
god
against _
during "
spread
thal ,
have
deceived"
all nations" before its judgment comes (Rev:
18.23).
Therefore it seems more
appropriate
say that Satan is
now still deceiving the nations
but at the beginning of the
millennium this deceptive influence will be removed_
There was an
evem
greater deception before Christ came
but there is still
significant deception that remains today:
The fact that John saw
souls" in his vision does not require that the
scene be set in heaven. Since these souls are persons who then
came
life'
in "the first resurrection'
we should see these as
people who obtained resurrection bodies and who
began to reign on
the earth. Moreover; Revelation 20:1 indicates that the scene
focused on events on the earth; for
says,
Then
saw an angel
coming down from heaven:
But if the angel came down from
heaven, then he carries out his activity On the earth, and the entire
scene is set on the earth:
Some amillennialists argue that the phrase
came [0 life" refers [0
coming to heavenly existence Or coming into the presence of God
But
must be asked_
Where does the Greek term zao ( "live" _
ever
take that meaning? No other examples of that word in the New
Testament take the sense,
come into the presence of God:
Moreover; amillennialist interpretations of the phrase
resurrection
unconvincing:
The word resurrection (Gk
anastasis) never
sewhere means
going to heaven" or
going into
the presence of God;
but rather
signifies
bodily resurrection: This
is the sense in which
century readers would have understood
the word: The other amillennialist view; which understands "the
first resurrection
to be Christ' $ resurrection (and 0ur union
him) does not seem
because those who
came t0 life'
the
ones who had been "beheaded for their testimony to Jesus
(v. 4),
which suggests
bodily resurrection after death
2. Does Scripture teach only one resurrection, S0 that believers and
unbelievers will be raised at the same time? It is hard to accept this
when we realize that Revelation 20 explicitly speaks about
'the first
resurrection;
thus implying that there will be
second resurection
as well
Speaking of those who came to life and reigned with Christ
thousand years_
we read, "This is the first resurrection_
Blessed
and holy is he who shares in the firSt resurrection! Over such the
"first
ficst-
with
likely
second death has no power" (vv: 5-6).
The passage distinguishes
those who share in this first resurrection and are blessed from
others who do not share in it They are "the rest of the dead" and
the implication is that "the second death" (that is, facing final
judgment and being condemned to eternal punishment away from
the presence of God) does have power over them; and they will
experience
But if this passage clearly teaches
first resurection;
and the fact that the rest of the dead will come t0 life at the end of _
thousand years_
then there is clear
teaching on two separate
resurrections here in Revelation 20_
As for the other passages that amillennialists claim to support the
view that there is only one resurrection, it must be said that those
passages do not exclude the idea of two resurrections
but they
simply do not specify whether or not the resurrection of believers
and unbelievers will be separated in time
In fact; Jesus
stalement
John
does hint at the possibility of tWO resurrections
He says
that those who are in the tombs will come forth, "those who have
done good, I0 the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil,
to the resurrection
of judgment" (John 5.28-29). In this way Jesus
in fact
speaks of two different resurrections_
As for Daniel 12.2.
it simply says that those who sleep in the dust
of the earth shall awake;
'some
everlasting life; and some
shame and
everlasting contempt;
but it does not specify whether
this will happen simultaneously or at different times_
It simply says
that both types of people will be raised. The same is true of Acts
24.15,
where Paul says there will be
resurrection of both the just
and the unjust:
This affirms that both types of people will be raised
from the dead, but it does not exclude the possibility that this would
happen at different times. All of these verses
in the absence of
Revelation 20.5
might or might not be
speaking of
single
future time of resurection
But with the explicit teaching of
Revelation 20.5
about tWo resurrections, these verses must be
understood t0 refer [0 the future
certainty of
resurrection for each
type of person, without
specifying that those resurrections will be
separated
time:
The idea of glorified believers and sinners living on earth
together
the millennium does sound strange
uS nOw, but ic
certainly not impossible for God to bring this about We must
realize that Jesus lived on the earth with
glorified body for forty
during "
after his resurrection;
and apparently there were many other
Old Testament saints who
with glorified bodies on earth
that time as well (Matt: 27.53).
It will indeed be
kind of
world situation that is far different and far more
God-glorifying
than the world is now, but it does not seem that we are justified in
asserting that God could not or would not
about such
state
of affairs. Certainly he could do it; and several
passages seem [0
indicate that he has
purpose and intention of doing
as well:
4. It is certainly not impossible that evil and secret rebellion could
persist on the earth in spite of the bodily presence of Christ reigning
as King:
We must remember that Judas lived with Jesus 0n the
closest terms for
years_
and still betrayed him. Moreover;
many of the Pharisees Saw Jesus' miracles; and even saw him
raising people from the dead, and still did not believe. In
even
when the disciples were in the presence of the
glorified Lord Jesus,
we read thar
some doubted" (Matt: 28.17)-
Such persistent
unbelief in the very presence of Christ
hard t0 understand, but we
must remember that Satan himself fell from an exalted position in
the presence of God in heaven.
When the amillennialists object that people could not persist in sin
in the presence of Christ'$ bodily reign on the earth, their position
simply fails t0 realize the deep-seated and highly irrational
nature
of sin: It also fails fully t0 reckon with the fact that even
massive
and
'undeniable evidence
cannot compel genuine
conversion_
Genuine repentance and faith is brought about by the
enabling
and persuasive work of the Holy Spirit in people
hearts.
Such is the irrational
nature of sin that those who are
dead in
trespasses and sins
will often persist in rebellion and unbelief even
in the face of
overwhelming evidence to the contrary:
This is not t0 say that no one will be converted
Christ during the
millennium No doubt millions of people will become Christians
that time
and the influence of the reign of Christ will
permeate into every aspect of every society in the world: Yet at the
same time
is not at all difficult to understand how evil and
rebellion will grow simultaneously:
God may have several purposes in mind for
future millennium;
not all of which may now be clear t0 uS. But certainly such
days -
lived
during
bring
good
tuce
facl,
proof"
during
millennium would show the outworking of God$ good purposes in
the structures of society; especially the structures of the family and
civil government During the church age
purposes 0f God
are primarily seen in individual lives and the blessings that come t0
those who believe in Christ: To some extent now (and to
greater
extent
times of revival) this affects civil government and
educational institutions and corporations_
and [0
larger extent it
affects the family But in none of these structures are God'$ good
purposes manifested to the extent they could be, showing God's
wisdom and goodness not only in his plans for individuals but
also for societab
structures. In the millennium the beauty of God'$
wisdom will show forth to his glory from all of these societal
structures_
Moreover; the millennium will further vindicate God $
righteousness. The fact that some
continue in sin and unbelief will
show that
sin rebellion against God is not due
an evil society OF
bad environmen
is due t0 the sinfulness of the hearts of
men.
Thus the justice of God will be fully vindicated in the day of
judgmenc
With Satan bound for
thousand years_
the fact
that sin can persist will also show that the ultimate blame for sin is
not demonic influence in people
lives but deep-rooted sinfulness
in people
hearts.
Third, the entire scope of the Bible reveals tO us that it is God's
pleasure t0 unfold his purposes and reveal more and more of
glory gradually over time. From the calling of Abraham to the
birth of Isaac; the sojourn in Egypt and the exodus
the
establishment of the people in the promised land_
the Davidic
kingdom and the divided monarchy; the exile and return with the
rebuilding of the temple, the preservation of
faithful remnant, and
finally the
of Jesus in the flesh; God $ purposes were
increasingly seen t0 be glorious and wonderful.Even in Jesus-
life
the progressive revealing of his glory took thirty-three years_
culminating in the last three years of his life
Then in Jesus' death;
resurrection; and ascension into heaven, the completion of our
redemption was accomplished
Yet the spread of the church
throughout all nations has nOw occupied over 1,900 years, and we
do not know how long
is [0 continue:
All this is tO say that God $
way iS nOr t0
realization all of his good purposes at once
but to unfold them gradually over time. This is SO even in the
individual lives of Christians, who grow daily in grace and in
good
great

fellowship with God and in likeness to Christ. Therefore
would
not be surprising if, before the eternal state, God instituted one final
step in the progressive unfolding of the history of redemption. It
would serve t0 increase his glory as men and
angels look on in
amazement at the wonder of God
wisdon and plan
Finally;
major objection t0 amillennialism must continue t0 be
the fact that it can propose nO really
satisfying explanation of
Revelation 20.
Colideraticn
Postmillennizlismn
The arguments in favor of postmillennialism are as follows:
The Great Commission leads us to expect that the gospel will g0
forth in power and eventually result in
largely Christian world:
Jesus explicitly said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has
been given t0 me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit,
them
observe all that
have commanded
you; and l0,
am with you always_
the close of the age
(Matt:
28.18-20). Since Christ has all authority in heaven and on earth,
and since he promises t0 be with us in the fulfillment of this
commission; we would expect that it would transpire without
hindrance and eventually triumph in the whole world_
Parables of the
growth of the kingdom indicate that it
eventually will fill the earth with its influence_
Here
postmillennialists point t0 the following:
Another parable he put before them;
saying; "The kingdom of heaven
is like
of mustard seed which
man took and sowed in his
field; it is the smallest of all seeds_
but when it has grown it is the
greatest of shrubs and becomes
tree
SO that the birds of the air come
and make nests in its branches_
(Matt: 13.31-32)
We can also note the
following verse
told them another parable
The
kingdom of heaven is like leaven which
woman took and hid in three
measures of
till it was all leavened' "(Matt: 13.33).
According
postmillennialists both of these parables indicate that the kingdom
grow
influence until it permeates and
some measure transforms the entire
world:
teaching
gradual
grain ,
"He
(lour;
Will
Postmillennialists will also argue that the world is becoming
more Christian. The church is growing and spreading throughout
the world, and even when it is persecuted and oppressed it grows
remarkably by the power of God.
At this point We
must make
very
significant distinction; however:
The
millennium'
that postmillennialists hold t0 is very different
from the
millennium" the premillennialists talk about: In
sense
they are no even
discussing the same topic. While premillennialists
talk about
renewed
earth with Jesus Christ physically present and
reigning as
together with glorified believers in resurrection
bodies, postmillennialists are simply talking about an earth with
many; many Christians influencing society They do not envisage
millennium
consisting of _
renewed earth Or
glorified saints or
Christ present in bodily form to reign (for they think that these
things will only occur after Christ returns tO inaugurate the eteral
state)
Therefore the entire discussion of the millennium is more
than simply
discussion of the sequence of events surrounding it: It
also involves
significant difference over the nature of this period
of time itself:
In fact; though
am nol aware
anyone has done this_
it would not
be impossible for someone t0 be
postmillennialist and
premillennialist at the same time_
with [Wo different senses of the
term millennium
Someone could conceivably be
postmillennialist
and think that the gospel will grow
influence until the world is
largely Christian
and that then Christ will return and set up
literal
earthly reign, raising believers from the dead tO reign with him in
glorified bodies. Or; on the other hand,
optimistic
premillennialist could conceivably adopt many of the
postmillennialist
about the
increasingly Christian nature
of this present age
In response to the postmillennialist arguments, the following points
may be made:
The Great Commission does indeed speak of the authority that is
given into Christ'=
hand
but that does not necessarily imply that
Christ will use that authority
bring about the conversion of the
majority of the population of the world: To say that Christ'$
authority is great is simply another way of saying that God'$ power
King:
vely
teachings
is infinite ,
which no one will deny. But the question is the extent t0
which Christ will use his power t0 bring about the numerical
growth of the church: We may assume that he will use it t0
full extent and will bring about worldwide Christianization, but
such an assumption is merely that
an assumption_
It is not based
on any specific evidence in the Great Commission Or in othel
texts
that talk about Christ's authority and power in this present age.
The parables of the
seed and the leaven do tell us that
the kingdom of God will gradually grow from something very small
to something very
large; but
do not tell us the extent [0 which
the kingdom
grow: For example; the parable of the mustard
seed does not tell us that the tree grew s0 that it spread throughout
the whole earth:
And the parable of the leaven simply talks about
growth that permeates society (as the church has already
done) , but
says
nothing about the degree or effect that that
influence has (it does not tell us_
for example, whether in the end
percent of the loaf was leaven and 95 percent bread dough_
or 20
percent
eaven and 8U percent bread_
or 60 percent
eaven and 40
percent bread_
and so forth). It is simply pressing the parable
beyond its intended purpose to attempt tO make
say more than
that the kingdom will grow gradually and eventually have an
influence on every society in which
is planted_
In response t0 the argument that the world is becoming more
Christian, it must be said that the world is also becoming more evil.
No student of history Or modern society
argue that mankind has
made much progress through the centuries in overcoming the depth
of perversity and the extent of immorality that remain in people'$
hearts. Indeed, modernization
western societies in the twentieth
century has often been accompanied not by moral improvement but
by an unprecedented level of
abuse; marital infidelity;
pornography; homosexuality; rebellion against authority;
superstition (in
astrology and the New Age movement),
materialism, greed, theft, and falsehood in speech: Even among
professing Christians there is repeated evidence of
dismaying
imperfection
the Christian life, especially in the realms of
personal
morality and depth of intimacy with God
In places where

and
should be greatly encouraged by this_
It is possible that we
someday see
far greater influence of genuine Christianity upon
many societies, and if that occurred, it would make the
postmillennial position seem more plausible: But such events could
also be understood within
premillennial
amillennial
framework, s0 the final decision
regarding these competing
positions must still be made by interpreting the relevant biblical
texts_
Finally, we should note that there are several New Testament
passages that seem t0 give explicit denial to the postmillennial
position. Jesus said, "Enter by the narrow
for the
is wide
and the way is easy; that leads to destruction, and those who enter
by it are many For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that
leads t0 life, and those who find it are few
(Matt: 7.13-14). Rather
than teaching that
majority of the world will become Christians,
Jesus seems here to be saying that those who are saved will be
"few
contrast
who travel toward eternal
destruction. Similarly, Jesus asks
When the Son of man comes;
will he find faith on earth?" (Luke 18.8) ,
question that suggests
that the earth will not be filled with those who believe; but will be
dominated rather by those who do not have faith_
Contrary t0 the view that the world will ger better and better as the
influence of the church grows, Paul predicts that before Christ
returns "the rebellion
come and "the man of lawlessness
Will
be revealed
"the son of perdition" who "takes his seat in the temple
of God, proclaiming himself to be God"
Thess 2.3-4).
When writing t0 Timothy about the last days_
Paul says,
In the last days there will come times of stress_
For men will be lovers
of self, lovers of money; proud, arrogant; abusive
disobedient
their
parents, ungrateful, unholy, inhuman, implacable, slanderers_

haters of good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with
conceit; lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding the form
of religion but denying the power of it: (2 Tim: 3.1-5)

and deceived
the time is coming when people will not endure
sound
teaching; but having itching ears they will accumulate for
themselves teachers t0 suit their own
likings, and will turn away from
listening to the truth and wander into myths_
(2 Tim. %12-13;, 4.3-4)
Finally; and perhaps most conclusively, Matthew 24:15-31 speaks
great tribulation that will precede the time of Christ'$ return:
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the
beginning of the world until now; no, and never will be: And if those
days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved; but for
the sake of the elect those days will be shortened_
Immediately
after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the
moon will not give its light; and the stars will fall from heaven, and
the powers of the heavens will be shaken; then will appear the sign of
the Son of man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth
mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of
heaven with power and great glory: (Matt: 24.21-30)
This passage pictures not
Christianized world but
world of
suffering and evil,
great tribulation that exceeds all previous
periods of suffering on the earth.
does not say that the great
majority of the world will welcome Christ when he comes_
but
rather that when the sign of the Son of man appears
heaven;
"then all the tribes of the earth will mourn" (Matt. 24.30).
Since Matthew 24 is such
difficult passage from the
postmillennialist perspective; there have been several attempts
explain
nO as
prediction of events that will occur just
Christ'$ second coming
but rather as
something that was mainly
fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem in AD: 705
To sustain this interpretation, postmillennialists make most of the
elements of Matthew 24.29-31 symbolic:
the sun and moon being
darkened, the stars
from heaven, and the powers of the
heavens
shaken are not t0 be understood as literal
events_
but
as imagery for God $ coming in
judgment. Similar imagery for
judgment is said t0 be found in Ezekiel 32.7; Joel 2:10; and Amos
8.9
but these passages simply speak of judgments of darkness_
and d not mention the stars
falling from heaven Or the powers
the heavens being shaken:
R T. France also mentions
Isaiah 13.10
will
greal
prior
falling=
being
and 34.4, which do talk about the sun and moon
darkened
and the host of heaven falling; but it is far from certain that France
is correct in claiming that those passages are merely symbolic
are set in contexts in which
could easily be understood as
literal predictions of the cosmic changes preceding the final
judgment So it is far from obvious that these passages are merely
apocalyptic imagery for judgment on Jerusalem:
Moreover; the interpreration that sees these as merely symbolic
statements grows more difficult as the statement of Jesus continues
for he does not only talk about signs in the sun; moon, and stars, but
he says immediately after that,
then will appear the sign of the Son
of man
heaven
and they will see the Son of man coming on
the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
(Matt: 24.30).
Consistent with his previous symbolic interpretation of this
passage,
France says that "all the tribes of the
refers merely
the Jews_
that
all the tribes (families) of the land,
that is,
the land of Israel. And he says that the reference to the Son of man
coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory does
not refer t0 Christ'$ return but t0 his
t0 the Father in heaven
"to receive vindication and authority
quotes with
approval the statement of G B. Caird, who says that "the coming of
the Son of Man in the clouds of heaven was never conceived as
primitive form of space travel, but as
symbol for
mighty
reversal of fortunes within history and at the national level:
Then
the
OuL of Christ' $
angels with
loud trumpet call to gather
his elect from one end of heaven t0 the other is understood [0 refer
messengers who preach the gospel throughout the earth: The
gathering of the elect then is gathering them into the church by the
preaching of the gospel.
However; 0n this interpretation France cannot satisfactorily account
for the fact that Jesus says that all the tribes of the earth "will see
the Son of man
on the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory" (Matt. 24.30). This is not an invisible heavenly
transaction in which Christ receives authority from God the Father;
but it is his return with power and great glory which is here
predicted_
Those who preach the gospel
are never elsewhere called
angels who give
loud trumpet call
and the preaching of the
gospel is not elsewhere called the gathering of "his elect from the
being
they
they
earth" _
coming
France
sending
coming
four winds_
from one end of heaven to the other" (Matt: 24.31).
Moreover; When Jesus elsewhere speaks of his coming on the
clouds
speaks not of
coming to God the Father in heaven, but
coming t0 people on earth:
Behold, he is coming with the
clouds
and every eye will see him, every one Who pierced him; and
all tribes of the
will
on account of him" (Rev: 1.7).
And
when Christ returns_
Paul says that we who are alive
shall be
caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
(1 Thess. 4:17). When Christ comes on the clouds of glory with
great power and authority; he comes [0 reign over the earth, and this
is the sense of Matthew 24.30-31. (France does not comment on
the fact that Jesus says the tribes of the earth who moum
will see
the Son of
Mdm
coming on the clouds of heaven" [v. 30]. The fact
that these tribes will see Jesus coming makes it difficult t0
understand any symbolic 0r invisible heavenly interpretation here.)
Moreover; the piling Up of factors that we know from other texts
be connected with Christ'$ return (cosmic signs, Christ'$ coming
with power; the loud trumpet call, the angels gathering the elect)
provides
cumulative case for
believing that Christ's second
coming_
not just
symbolic representation of his receiving
authority
in view here.
And if Matthew 24 talks about Christ'$
second coming; then it alks about his
just after
period of
great tribulation, not after
millennium of peace and righteousness
has been established on the earth:
Finally; all of the passages indicating that Christ could return soon
and that we must be ready for him to retum at any time
must be
considered
significant argument against postmillennialism as
well:
For if Christ could retum at any time, and
are [0 be ready
for his return
then the long period required for the establishment of
the millennium on earth before Christ returns simply cannot be
thought
persuasive theory.
D. A Consideration of the Arguments for
Premillennialism
The position advocated in this book is historic
premillennialism.
The arguments against the
ennial position have essentially
been presented in the arguments for amillennialism and
postmillennialism; and will therefore not be repeated
herein
separate section, but incidental objections t0 these arguments will

coming
premill
again _
be considered along the way:
Several Old Testament
passages seem t0 fit neither in the present
age nor in the eternal state_
These passages indicate some future
stage in the history of redemption which is far greater than the
present church age but which still does not see the removal of all
sin and rebellion and death from the earth:
Speaking of Jerusalem at some time in the future_
Isaiah says:
No more shall there be in it
an infant that lives but
few
0r' an
old man who does not fill out his days
for the child shall die
hundred years old,
and the sinner
hundred years old shall be accursed. (Isa. 65.20)
Here we read that there will be no more infants who die in
infancy, and no
more old men who die prematurely;
something far different from this present
age_
But death and sin
be present; for the child who is one hundred
years old shall die_
and the sinner who is one hundred years old "shall be
accursed
The larger context of this passage may mingle elements of the
millennium and the eternal state (cf:
17, 25) , but it is in the nature of Old
Testament prophecy not to
distinguish among events in the future, just as
these prophecies do not distinguish between the first and second comings of
Christ Therefore in the
larger context there may be mixed elements, but the
point remains that this single element (the infants and old men who live long;
the child dying one hundred years old, and the sinner
accursed)
indicates
specific time in the future that is different from the present age.
Isaiah seems
predict
millennial kingdom in another place when
he says:
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb;
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
and the calf and the lion and the fatling together;
and
little child shall lead them:
days,
will
still
being
The cow and the bear shall feed;
their
oung shall lie down together;
and the lion shall eat straw like the OX.
The sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp,
and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.
They shall not hurt or destroy
in all my holy mountain;
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD
as the waters cover the sea: (Isa: 11.6-9)
This passage clearly speaks of
momentous renewal of nature that takes US
far beyond the present age,
time in which "the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea"
(v. 9). Yet in the very
next verse [saiah says:
In that day the root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign t0 the peoples; him
shall the nations seek, and his dwellings shall be glorious_
[hat day the Lord
extend his hand yer
second time t0
TELUYEI
the remnant which is left of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt; from
Pathros, from Ethiopia. (Isa. 1:10-11)
Here some are still seeking the Messiah and apparently coming
salvation,
and here also the Lord is still gathering the remnant of his people from
various nations of the earth:
does not seem; therefore
that the eternal state
has begun; yet the reversal of nature far exceeds anything that will happen in
this present age.
Does this not indicate
future millennial kingdom?
Psalm 72 seems t0 g0 beyond
description of Solomon $ reign and
predict the glories of the reign of the Messiah:
He will rule from sea
sea
and
the River t0 the ends of the earth
The desert tribes will bow before him
Will
from
and his enemies will lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores
will
tribute [0
the kings of Sheba and Seba
will present him gifts
AlI kings will bow down
and all nations will serve him.
For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
the afflicted who have no-one
help:
He will take pity on the weak and the needy
and save the needy from death:
He will rescue them from oppression and violence;
for precious is their blood in his sight: (Ps. 72.8-14 NIV)
This passage certainly speaks of
messianic rule far more extensive than thal
experienced by David or Solomon, because this Messiah's kingdom extends
"t0 the ends of the earth'
and
all nations will serve him"
(vv: 8, 11 NIV; note
that the psalm also says: "He will endure as long as the Sun, as long as the
moon
through all generations`
in V
NIV)
This will be
reign in
righteousness, in justice
but it certainly will not be the eternal state. There
are still "the needy who cry out" and "the afflicted who have no one t0 help'
there are still people who need to be rescued "from oppression and violence
12-14). There will still be enemies who "will lick the dust" under the
reign of this righteous
(v. 9). All of this speaks of an age far different
from the present age but short of the eternal state in which there
no more
sin 0r'
suffering:
Zechariah also prophesies
age in which there is great
transformation in the earth; in which the Lord is King over all the
earth; and in which there
still rebellion and sin, suffering
and
death:
bring
hin;
him
King
coming
Then the LORD your God will come; and all the holy ones with him. On
that day there shall be neither cold nor frost
And there shall be
continuous day (it is known t0 the LORD), not day and not night; for at
evening time there shall be light
On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem; half of them to
the eastern sea
half of them to the western sea; it shall continue in
summer as in Winter:
And the LORD
become king over all the earth; on that day the LORD
will be one and his name one.
And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the
peoples that wage
against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they
are still on their
their eyes shall rot in their sockets, and their
tongues shall rot in their mouths.
And the wealth of all the nations
round about shall be collected, gold, silver; and garments in great
abundance:
Then every one that survives of all the nations that have come
Jerusalem shall go up year after
to worship the King; the LORD of
hosts, and
keep the feast of booths
And if any of the families of the
earth do not g0 up t0 Jerusalem t0 worship the
the LORD of hosts,
there will be no rain upon them (Zech 14.5-17)
Here
the description does not fit the present age, for the Lord is
over all the earth in this situation. But it does not fit the eternal state either;
because of the disobedience and rebellion against the Lord that is clearly
present:
One might object that this is
typical Old Testament prophecy in
which distinct future events are conflated and not distinguished in the
prophet'$ vision, though
may be separated by long ages when they
actually
ucLuI
However; it is difficult
make such
distinction in this
passage because it is specifically rebellion against the Lord who is King over
all the earth that is punished by these plagues and lack of rain.
There are also New Testament passages other than Revelation 20
that suggest
future millennium. When the risen Lord Jesus speaks
the church at Thyatira _
he says, "He who conquers and who
keeps my works until the end,
will give him power over the
nations, and he shall rule them with
rod of iron, as when earthen
pots are broken in pieces
even as
myself have received power
from my Father" (Rev: 2.26-27). The imagery used (ruling with
and
Will
feel,

year
King:
again
King
they
rod of iron;
shattering earthen
implies
rule of force over
rebellious people. But when will believers who conquer over evil
participate in this rule? The idea fits well into
future millennial
kingdom when glorified saints rule with Christ on the earth; but
does not fit well at any time in the present age 0r in the eternal
stale: ( The idea 0f
ruling the nations
with
rod of iron
is also
found in Rev: 12.5-
and 19.15.)
When Paul talks about the resurection, he says that each person
will receive
resurrection body in his Own order:
Christ the first
fruits, then (epeita) at his coming those who belong to Christ: Then
(eita) comes the end,
when he delivers the kingdom to God the
Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power:
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet" ( 1
Cor: 15.23-25). The tWo words translated "then
in this passage
(epeita and eita) both take the sense "after that;
not the sense "at
that
time
Therefore the passage gives some support tO the
idea
just as there is an interval
of time between Christ'$
resurection and his second

resurrection
body
23), s0 there is an interval of time between Christ' $ second
coming and "the end" (v 24), when Christ delivers the kingdom to
God after
reigned for
time and put all his enemies under
his feel:
With the background of .
number of other passages that hint at or
clearly suggest
future time far greater than the present age but
short of the eternal state, it is appropriate then to look at Revelation
20 once again. Several statements here are best understood as
referring t0
future earthly reign of Christ prior t0 the future
judgment
The binding and imprisonment of Satan in the bottomless pit (vV:
2-3) imply
far greater restriction of his activity than anything we
know in this present age (see discussion above, under
amillennialism)
The statement that those who were faithful
came t0 life" (v 4) is
best taken as referring
bodily resurrection, for the next verse
says,
This is the first resurrection.
The verb ezesan,
came [0
life,
is the same verb and the same form of the verb used in
Revelation 2.8, where Jesus identifies himself as the one
who died
pots)
same
that;
coming
having
and came t0 life,
here obviously referring t0 his resurrection_
On
premillennial interpretation, the reigning with Christ (in
Rev: 20.4) is
something
that is still future; not
something that is
occurring now (as amillennialists claim) This
consistent with the
rest of the New Testament; where we are frequently told that
believers will reign with Christ and be given authority by him 0
reign over the earth (see Luke 19.17, 19;
Cor: 6.3; Rev 2.26-27;
3.21). But nowhere does Scripture say that believers in the
intermediate state (between their death and Christ'$ retum) are
reigning with Christ Or sharing in rule with him. In
Revelation
earlier pictures saints
heaven before Christ'$ return waiting under
the altar and crying out [O the Lord t0 begin [0 judge evildoers 0n
the earth (Rev: 6.9-10).
Nowhere
ic said that Christians are
already reigning with Christ:
Those who come to life and reign with Christ in Revelation 20
include people "who had not worshiped the beast or its image and
had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands
(Rev:
20.4)
This is a reference
those who did not yield to the
persecution by the beast spoken of in Revelation 13.1-18. But if the
severity of persecution described in Revelation 13 leads us t0
conclude thar the beast has not
come 0n the world scene_
but is
future_
then the persecution by this beast is still future as
well:
And if this persecution is still future_
then the scene in Revelation
20 where those
who had not worshiped the beast
and had not
received its mark on their foreheads or their hands" (Rev: 20.4) is
still future as well This means that Revelation 20.1-6 does not
describe the present church age but is best understood tO refer [0
future millennial reign of Christ.
These considerations combine t0 make
case in favor of
premillennialism. If we are convinced of this position, it really is an
incidental question whether the thousand-year period is thought tO
literal thousand years 0r simply
long period of time of
indeterminate duration:
And though we may not have much clarity
on all the details of the nature of the millennium_
can be
reasonably certain that there will be
future earthly reign of Christ
that will be markedly different from this present age.
The Tina o the Grrat Tribulation
facl;
Jet
Yet
For those who are persuaded by the arguments in favor of
premillennialism, one further question must be decided: Will Christ
return before or after the
great tribulation'"
The expression
great tribulation" itself comes from Matthew 24.21
(and parallels) , where Jesus says, "For then there will be
tribulation, such as has not been
the beginning of the world
until now; no_
and never will be:
Historic premillennialism
believes that Christ will return after that tribulation; for the passage
continues, "Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun
will be darkened
then will appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven; and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and
will
the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory" (Matt: 24.29-30)
But; as explained above
in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries
variety of premillennialism that
holds t0
pretribulational coming of Christ became popular: This
often called
pretribulation rapture
view; because it holds that
when Christ first retums the church will be "raptured" or snatched
up into heaven t0 be with him
The arguments for such
pretribulation rapture are as follows:
The entire period of the tribulation will be
time of the
outpouring of God s wrath on all the earth: Therefore
would not
be appropriate for Christians to be on the earth at that time
Jesus promises in Revelation 3.10,
keep you from the hour
of trial which is coming on the whole world, t0 try those who dwell
upon the earth:
This passage indicates that the church will be taken
out of the world before that hour of trial comes.
3. If Christ retums after the tribulation and defeats all his enemies
then where will the unbelievers come from who are necessary t0
populate the millennial kingdom? The pretribulation position,
however; envisages thousands of Jewish believers who have
become Christians
the tribulation and who will go into the
millennial kingdom in nonglorified bodies_
This view makes
possible to believe that Christ could come at
any moment (his coming before the tribulation) and yet that many
signs must be fulfilled before he comes (his
after the
tribulation, when the signs will be fulfilled)
great
ftom
they
will
during-
coming
Although it is not specifically an argument in favor of
pretribulation position, it must also be noted that pretribulationists
then view the
teaching about the tribulation in Matthew 24 and the
wamings and encouragements given to believers in that situation as
applying to Jewish believers during the tribulation, and not
the
church generally:
In response t0 these arguments_
the following points may be made:
1. It is inconsistent with the New Testament descriptions of the
tribulation to say that all the
suffering that occurs =
that time
is specifically the result of the wrath of God. Much of the suffering
is due t0 the fact that "wickedness is multiplied" (Matt: 24.12) and
the fact that persecution of the church and opposition from Satan
greatly increases during this period
Of course all Christians
(whether Gentile or Jewish believers) will avoid the wrath of God
at all times_
but this does nOt mean they will avoid all suffering;
even in times of intense hardship.
The fact that Jesus tells faithful believers in the church in
Philadelphia (Rev: 3.10) that he will
them from the hour of
trial thar is
on the whole world is not strong enough
evidence t0 say that the entire church will be taken out of the world
before the tribulation. First; this statement is made t0 one specific
church (Philadelphia) and should not be applied t0 the whole
church
some future point in history. Moreover; "the hour of trial
which is coming on the whole
need
refer to the time of
the great tribulation, but more likely refers to
time of
suffering and persecution that would come upon the entire Roman
Empire or the entire inhabited world. Finally; the promise that the
church in Philadelphia will be guarded does not imply that they will
be taken out of the world, but simply that they will be
faithful
and will be
guarded from being harmed by that period of suffering
and testing:
3. It is no argument for the pretribulation view tO say that there
must be some people in
nonglorified bodies who will enter the
millennium; because (0n
posttribulational view) when Christ
comes at the end of the tribulation he will defeat all the forces
arrayed
him, but that does nOr mean he will kill or
annihilate all of them: Many will simply surrender without trusting
Christ; and will thus enter the millennium as unbelievers _
And
during
keep
coming

not

the entire period of the millennium no doubt many will be
converted t0 Christ and become believers as well
The pretribulational
view
not the only one consistent with the
ideas that Christ could come back at any time that there are signs
that precede his return. The position presented in the previous
chapter
~thar
unlikely but possible that the signs have been
fulfilled
-is also consistent with these ideas_
But
must be said that behind this argument of pretribulationists is
probably
more fundamental concern: the desire to preserve
distinction between the church (which they think will be taken up
into heaven t0 be with Christ) and Israel (which they think will
constitute the people of God on earth during the tribulation and then
during the millennial kingdom) But; as we noted in an earlier
chapter;
the
Testament does not support
distinction of this
kind between Israel
and the church:
Hence
does not imply
need
[O see
distinction between these groups at the time of the
tribulation and the millennium:
There is
variation of the pretribulation rapture position that is
known as the midtribulation rapture view: It is defended by
Gleason Archer in his essay;
Case for the Mid-Seventieth -
Week Rapture Position
He sees the tribulation as separated into
[WO halves_
The
three and
half years are characterized by the
wrath of man, and the church
present at that time: The second
three and
half years are characterized by the wrath of God, and
during that time the church is absent from the earth:
The primary
argument from Scripture to support
midtribulational rapture is the
fact that in Daniel 7.25,9.27
and 12.7 and 14, as well as in
Revelation 12.14, the seven
01 times indicated are cuL in half;
mentioning the interval of three and
half times or three and
half
days in
symbolic week, thus indicating
period of three and
half
years, after which God's people will be rescued from tribulation.
Another argument in favor of this position is that it gives
heightened sense of expectancy
Christ' $ retum; since three and
half years
shorter period of time than seven years_
However; though the passages in Daniel do speak of an interruption
of the seventieth week which Daniel predicts for the future, they do
not give any clear indication that mid-way through the week
during
New
"The
fitst
days
believers will be removed trom the earth:
It is also hard t0 see thal
the expectation of
three-and-a-half-year tribulation provides
much greater sense of imminence than does the expectation of
seven-year tribulation:
Finally; some objections to the pretribulational rapture position can
be stated in the form of arguments in favor of the posttribulational
rapture view (the historic premillennial view that Christ will retum
atter
period of tribulation on the earth):
The New Testament nowhere clearly says that the church will be
taken out of the world before the tribulation. If this significant event
were to happen; we might at least expect that explicit teaching t0
that effect would be found in the New Testament: Certainly Jesus
tells us that he will come again and take us t0 be with himself (John
14.3), and Paul tells us that we shall be caught up in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air (1 Thess. 4:17), and that we shall be
changed in the twinkling of an eye and receive resurrection bodies
Cor: 15.51-52) , but each of these passages has been understood
by believers throughout history as speaking not of
secret rapture
of the church before the tribulation_
but of
very visible public
rapture (or "taking up
of the church to be with Christ just
few
mmeMLS
prior to his coming t0 earth with them tO reign during the
millennia_
kingdom (01;, on the amillennial view, during the eternal
stale).
Moreover; it is very difficult tO understand
Thessalonians 4.17,
the only passage that explicitly
of the fact thar the church
will be
caught up
(or "raptured" =
to speak of the idea of
secret
coming
Ic says, " The Lord himself-
descend from heaven with
cry of command, with the archangel $ call, and with the sound of
the trumpet of God"
Thess. 4.16). Of these words Leon Morris
rightly says; "It may be that
this he intends uS t0 understand
that the rapture will take place secretly; and that no one except the
saints themselves will know what is going on. But one would
hardly gather this from his words_
It is difficult t0 see how he could
more plainly describe
something that is open and public:
The doctrine of
pretribulation rapture is an inference from several
passages, all of which are disputed. Moreover; even if one believes
this doctrine t0 be in Scripture, it is taught with such little clarity
speaks
will
from
that
was not discovered until the nineteenth century: This does not
make
seem likely:
The tribulation is quite clearly linked with the Lord's retum in
some
passages First; the loud trumpet call t0
the elect in
Matthew 24.31_
the sound of the trumpet of God in
Thessalonians
4.16_
and the last trumpet at which our bodies are changed in
Corinthians 15.51-52, all seem to be the same trumpet
~the last
trumpet that is blown just before the millennium: If it is indeed the
"last trumpet"
Cor: 15.52) , then
is hard [0 see how another
loud trumpet call (Matt: 24.31) could follow it seven years later:
In addition; Matthew 24 is very difficult to understand as referring
not [0 the church but tO Jewish people who would be saved during
the tribulation. Jesus is
addressing his disciples (Matt: 24:1-4) and
waring them of persecution and suffering
come: He tells them
of the great tribulation to come, and then says that "immediately
after the tribulation of those
cosmic signs will appear and
"then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
and
will see the
Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and
glory'
(Matt_ 24.30)-
But is it likely that Jesus_
in saying all these
to his disciples, intended his words to apply not t0 the church
but only t0
future earthly kingdom of Jewish people who would
be converted during the tribulation? HOw could the disciples have
known that he had such
meaning in mind?
does it seem likely
that the disciples are here as representatives of
future Jewish
kingdom and not as representatives of the church, with
founding they were s0 integrally connected as to be its foundation
(Eph: 2.20).
Finally, the New Testament does not seem
justify the idea of
LWO separale returns of Christ (once for his church before the
tribulation and then seven years later with his church t0
judgment on unbelievers). Once again_
no such view is explicitly
taught in any passage
but it is simply an inference drawn from
differences between various passages that describe Christ'$ return
from different perspectives_
But it is nOt at all difficult t0 see these
passages as referring to
single event occurring at one time_
seems best tO conclude, with the great majority of the church
throughout
that the church
g0 through the time of
tribulation predicted by Jesus_
We would probably not have chosen

but the decision was not OuIS t0 make_
And
if God wills that any of uS nOw alive remain on earth until the time
of this
tribulation, then we should heed Peter's words, "If you
are
reproached for the name of Christ; YOu are blessed_
because the
spirit of glory and of God rests upon YOu
Peter 4.14), and,
"Christ also suffered for YOu, leaving YOu an example, that you
should follow in his steps" ( 1 Peter 2.21). This idea that Christians
should be prepared t0 endure
suffering
is also seen in Paul $ words
that we are fellow heirs with Christ;
provided we suffer with him
in order that we may also be
glorified
him" (Rom. 8.17). And
we may remember that from the time of Noah to the time of the
martyrdom of the early apostles; it has frequently been God's way
bring his people through suffering to glory; for thus he did even
with his own Son "For it was
that he, for whom and by
whom all
in bringing many sons to glory; should make
the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering'
(Heb: 2.10).
It is from the Savior who himself has suffered more than any of his
children will ever suffer that we have the admonition; "Do nOr fear
what you are about to suffer:
Be faithful unto death, and
will
give yOu the crown of life
(Rev: 2.10).
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
Before reading this chapter; did you have any conviction about whether
Christ'$ return would be amillennial, postmillennial, Or premillennial?
And whether
would be posttribulational
pretribulational? If SO, how
has your view nOw changed, if at all?
Explain how your present view of the millennium affects your Christian
life today: Similarly, explain how your view of the tribulation affects
your present Christian life.
What do you think it will feel like to be living on earth with
glorified
body; and with Jesus Christ as King over the whole world? Can yOu
describe in any detail some of the attitudes and emotional responses YOU
will have toward various situations in such
kingdom? Do you really
look forward [0 such
kingdom? ( Your answers will differ somewhat
depending on whether YOu expect
glorified body during the millennium
or not until the eternal state_
What might be both the positive and the negative results of
pretribulation rapture
position in the everyday lives and attitudes of
Christians? Similarly; what might be the positive and negative results of

SCRIPTURE MEMORY PASSAGE
Revelation 20.4-6: Then
Suw
thrones, and seated on them were those
whom judgment was committed. Also
saw the souls of those who had been
beheaded for their testimony t0 Jesus and for the word of God, and who had
nOr worshiped the beast
its image and had not received its mark on their
foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ
thousand years:
The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand
years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy
he who
shares in the first resurrection:
Over such the second death has no power; but
they shall be priests of God and of Christ; and they shall reign with him
thousand vears
HYMN
Shall Reign Where'er the Sun"
This hymn by Isaac Watts beautifully describes the reign of Christ
over the whole earth: Whether Our' personal convictions 0n the
millennium lead us tO understand this hymn as referring to the
millennium 0r t0 the eternal state, in either case
gives an excellent
picture of the kingdom for which our hearts
and the blessings
that will
come when Jesus is King over the earth
Things
Findlay;
"Jesus
long
Jesus shall reign wherever the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore_
Til moons shall wax and wane no more
For him shall endless prayer be made_
And praises throng tO crown his head;
His name
like sweet perfume_
shall rise
With every moring sacrifice _
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on his love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on his name_
Blessings abound where' er he reigns;
The pris'ner leaps to loose his chains,
The weary find eternal rest;
And all the sons of want are blest
Let every creature rise and
Peculiar honors
ouL
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud amen.

The Final Judgment and Eternal
Punishment
Who will be judged? What is hell?
EXPLANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
The Fact
Judement
Scriptural Evidence for
Final
Judgment: Scripture frequently affirms
the fact that there will be
great final judgment of believers and unbelievers:
stand before the judgment seat of Christ in resurected bodies and
hear his proclamation of their eternal destiny:
The final judgment
vividly portrayed in John
vision in
Revelation:
Then
saw
great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his
presence earth and sky fled away; and no place was found for them:
And
saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and
books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book
of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by
what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead in it, death and
hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had
done:
Then death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is
the second death, the lake of
and
anyone
name was not found
written in the book of life; he was thrown into the lake of fire. (Rev:
20.11-15)
Many other passages teach this final judgment: Paul tells the Greek
philosophers in Athens that God
Now
commands all men
everywhere to repent; because he has fixed
day on which he will
judge the world in righteousness by
man whom he has
appointed,
and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him
the dead" (Acts 17.30-31).
Similarly, Paul talks about "the day of
wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed" (Rom:
They
will.
tire;
from
2.5). Other passages speak clearly of
coming day of judgment
(see Matt: 10.15; 11.22,24; 12.36; 25.31-46;
Cor: 4.5; Heb. 6.2;
Peter 2.4; Jude 6; et al.)
This final judgment is the culmination of many precursors in which
God rewarded righteousness 0r punished unrighteousness
throughout history. While he brought blessing and deliverance from
danger to those who were faithful to him;
including Abel, Noah,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; Moses_
David, and the faithful among the
people of Israel, he also from
tO time brought judgment on
those who persisted in disobedience and unbelief: his judgments
included the flood, the dispersion of the people from the tower of
Babel, the judgments on Sodom and Gomorrah, and continuing
judgments throughout
both on individuals (Rom. 1.18-32)
and on nations (Isa
23; er al.) who persisted in sin. Moreover;
UmSeE
spiritual realm he brought judgment on angels who
sinned (2 Peter 2.4) . Peter reminds us that God's judgments have
been carried out periodically and with certainty; and this reminds uS
that
final judgment is yet coming; for "the Lord knows how tO
rescue the
godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteousness under
punishment until the day of judgment; and especially those who
indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority"
Peter 2.9-10).
2. Will There Be More Than One Judgment? According to
dispensational
view; there is more than one
judgment to come:
For example;
dispensationalists would not see the final judgment
Matthew 25.31-46:
When the Son of Man comes in his glory; and all the angels with him;
then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all
the nations_
and he will separate them one from another as
shepherd
separates the sheep from the goats, and he
place the sheep at his
right hand
but the goats at his left Then the King will say to those at
his right hand, "Come_
0 blessed of my Father; inherit the kingdom
prepared for yOu from the foundation of the world; for
was hungry
and you gave me food
As you did it to one of the least of these
my brothers _
you did it to me_
Then he will say to those at his left
hand;
"Depart trom me_
YOu cursed
into the eternal fire prepared for
the devil and his angels; for
was
hungry and you
me nO
food.
As you did
nol
one of the
east of these, You did it not to
me_
And
will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous
into eternal life.
time
history.'
Will
gave
they
From
dispensational perspective_
this passage does not refer tO final
judgmenc (the
great white throne judgment" spoken of in Rev 20:11-15),
but rather [0
judgment that comes after the tribulation and before the
beginning of the millennium. They say that this will be
"judgment of the
nations
in which the nations are judged according t0 how they have treated
the Jewish people during the tribulation. Those who have treated the Jews
well and are
submit t0 Christ will enter into the millennium, and
those who have not will be refused entrance_
Thus, in
dispensationalist
there are different judgments:
"judgment of the nations'
(Matt. 25.31-46) to determine who
enters the millennium; (b_
"judgment of believers
works"
(sometimes called the boma judgment after the Greek word for
"judgment seat" in 2 Cor: 5.10) in which Christians will receive
degrees of reward; and (c) a
great white throne judgment" at the
end of the millennium (Rev 20.11-15) to declare eternal
punishments for unbelievers
The view taken in this book is that these three passages all speak of
the same final judgment, not of three separate judgments.
With
regard
Matthew 25.31-46 in particular; it is unlikely that the
dispensational view is correct: There is no mention of entering into
the
ennium in this passage
Moreover; the judgments
pronounced speak not of entrance into the millennial kingdom on
earth or exclusion from that kingdom but of eterna)
destinies of
people: "Inherit the kingdom prepared for yOu from the foundation
of the world
Depart from me; YOu cursed, into the eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels
And
will go away
into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life
(vv. 34,
41,46). Finally; it would be inconsistent with God'$ ways
throughout Scripture
deal with people
eternal destiny 0n the
basis of what nation they
belong t0
for -
unbelieving nations have
believers within them; and nations that exhibit more conformity t0
God'$ revealed will still have many wicked within them. And "God
shows no partiality" (Rom: 2:11). Though indeed "all the nations'
are gathered before Christ'$ throne in this scene (Matt: 25.32), the
picture of judgment is one of judgment on individuals (sheep are
separated from goats_
and those individuals who treated Christ $
brothers kindly are welcomed into the kingdom while those who
rejected them are rejected, VV:
35-40,42-45).

The final judgment will occur after the millennium and the
rebellion that occurs at the end of it John pictures the millennial
kingdom and the removal of Satan from influence on the earth in
Revelation 20.1-6 (see the discussion in the previous two chapters)
and then says that
when the thousand years are ended, Satan will
be loosed from his prison and will come out [0 deceive the nations
them for battle" (Rev: 20.7-8).
After God decisively
defeats this final
rebellion (Rev: 20.9-10) , John tells us that
judgment will follow:
saw
great white throne and him
who sat upon it" (v 11).
Idenent
Jesus Christ Will Be the Judge_
Paul
Jesus Christ who is [0
judge the living and the dead" (2 Tim. 4.1) Peter says that Jesus Christ "is the
one ordained by God to be the judge of the living and the dead" (Acts 10.42;
compare 17.317
Matt: 25.31-33). This right t0 act as judge over the whole
universe is something that the Father has given t0 the Son: "The Father
has given him authority
execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man
(John 5.26-27).
Unbelievers
Be Judged_
It is clear that all unbelievers will stand
before Christ for judgment; for this judgment includes "the dead,
and
small" (Rev: 20.12), and Paul says that
on the day of wrath when God'$
righteous judgment will be revealed;
~he will render t0 every man according
[0 his works
for those who are factious and do not obey the truth; but obey
wickedness
there will be wrath and
(Rom: 2.5-7).
This judgment of unbelievers will include degrees of punishment,
for we read that the dead were judged
by what they had done
(Rev 20:12, 13), and this judgment according to what people had
done must therefore involve an evaluation of the works that people
have done
Similarly; Jesus says:
And that servant who knew his master
will, but did not make ready
Or' act
according to his will, shall receive
severe beating_
But he who
did not know; and did what deserved
beating, shall receive
light
(Luke 12.47
48).
When Jesus says t0 the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida,
shall be more
tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you" (Matt.
11.22; compare
24), or" when he says that the scribes "will receive the
gather =
Then
NJtte
speaks

greater condemnation "
(Luke 20.47), he implies that there will be degrees of
punishment on the last day:
every wrong deed done will be remembered and taken
account of in the punishment that is meted out on that
because
on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless
word they utter
(Matt: 12.36). Every word spoken; every deed
done will be brought to light and receive judgment:
For God will
bring every deed into judgment; with every secret thing
whether
Or' evil" (Eccl. 12.14).
As these verses indicate
on the day of judgment the secrets of
people
hearts will be revealed and made public Paul speaks of the
day when "God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus
(Rom
2.16; compare Luke 8.17).
"Nothing
covered up that will not be
revealed, or hidden that will not be known_
Therefore whatever YOu
have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have
whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the
housetops
(Luke 12.2-3).
3. Believers Will Be Judged_
In writing to Christians Paul says_
We shall all
stand before the judgment seat of God.
Each of us shall give account of
himself to God" (Rom: 14.10, 12). He also tells the Corinthians; "For we muSt
all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what
is due him for the things done while in the body; whether
bad" (2 Cor:
5.10; cf: Rom: 2.6-11; Rev: 20.12, 15). In addition, the picture of the final
judgment in Matthew 25.31-46 includes Christ separating the
from the
goats_
and
rewarding those who receive his blessing
It is important t0 realize that this judgment of believers will be
judgment t0 evaluate and bestow various degrees of reward (see
below), but the fact that they will face such
judgment should
never cause believers t0 fear that
will be eternally condemned:
Jesus says,
"He who hears my word and believes him who sent me;
has eternal life; he does not come
IlU
judgment; but has passed
from death [0
(John 5.24). Here "judgment" must be
understood in the sense of etemal condemnation and death, since it
is contrasted with
passing from death into life
At the
of final
judgment more than at any other time, it is of utmost importance
that "there
therefore nOw no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus
(Rom: &.1). Thus the day of judgment can be
portrayed as one
which believers are rewarded and unbelievers

day '
are
punished:
The nations raged_
but your wrath came_
and the time for the dead t0
be judged, for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints_
and
those who fear your name_
both small and great; and for destroying
the destroyers of the earth: (Rev: 11:18)
Will all the secrer words and deeds of believers_
and all their sins
also be revealed on that last day? It seems that this is S0, because in
writing t0 believers about the day of judgment he says that when
the Lord comes he will
[0 light the things now hidden in
darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart: Then every
man will receive his commendation from God"
Cor: 4.5;
compare Col. 3.25). Certainly this fact should provide
motive for
godly
and Paul uses it that way in 2 Corinthians 5.9-10: "We
make
our aim t0 please him: For we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ.
But it should not cause terror Or alarm on
the part of believers, because even sins that are made public on that
day will be made public as sins that have been forgiven, and thereby
will be the occasion for giving glory to God for the richness of
his grace_
Scripture also teaches that there will be degrees of reward for
believers. Paul encourages the Corinthians to be careful how they
build the church on the foundation that has already been laid
Jesus Christ himself:
Now if anyone builds on the foundation with
silver; precious
stones; wood_
straw
each man'$ work will become manifest; for
the Day will disclose it; because it will be revealed with fire,
and the
fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which
any man has built on the foundation survives
he will receive
reward If any man $ work is burned up
he will suffer loss, though he
himself will be saved, but only as through fire
Cor: 3.12-15)
Paul similarly says of Christians that
we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him
for the things done while in the body; whether good or bad" (2 Cor:
5.10), again implying degrees of reward for what we have done in
this life: Likewise_
in the parable of the pounds, the one who made
ten
pounds more was told; "You shall have authority over ten
cities;
and the one whose pound had made five pounds more was
"bring
living: =
they
gold;
hay;
told,
And yOu are t0 be over five cities'
(Luke 19.17, 19). Many
other passages likewise teach r imply
of reward for
believers at the final judgment:
But we must
guard against misunderstanding here=
Even though
there
be degrees of reward in heaven; the joy of each person
will be full and complete for eternity. If we ask how this can be
when there are different
degrees of reward, it simply shows that our
perception of happiness is based on the assumption that happiness
depends on what we possess Or the status Or pOwer that we have. In
actuality; however; our tnue happiness consists in delighting in God
and rejoicing in the status and recognition that he has given us. The
foolishness of thinking that only those who have been highly
rewarded and given great status will be fully happy in heaven is
seen when we realize that no matter how great a reward we are
given, there will always be those with greater rewards, Or who have
higher status and authority, including the apostles, the heavenly
crealures_
and Jesus Christ and God himself:
Therefore if highest
status were essential for people to be fully happy; no one but God
would be fully happy in heaven, which is certainly an incorrect
idea. Moreover; those with greater reward and honor in heaven;
those nearest the throne of God, delight not in their status but only
in the privilege of falling down before God*$ throne to worship him
(see Rev: 4.10-11).
would be morally and spiritually beneficial for US t0 have
greater consciousness of this clear New Testament teaching on
degrees of heavenly reward. Rather than
competitive
with one another; it would cause US to help and encourage one
another that we all may increase OuI heavenly reward_
tor God has
infinite capacity to bring blessing t0 us all, and we are all
members of one another (cf:
Cor: 12.26-27). We would more
eagerly heed the admonition of the author of Hebrews, "Let uS
consider how to stir Up one another to love and good works_
not
neglecting
t0 meer
together; as is the habit of some_
but
encouraging one another; and all the more as YOu see the
drawing
(Heb_
10.24-25). Moreover; in Our own lives
heartfelt seeking of future heavenly reward would motivate US t0
work wholeheartedly for the Lord at whatever task he calls us t0,
whether great or small, paid 0r

Angels Will Be Judged.
Peter says that the rebellious angels have been
committed tO pits of nether gloom "to be
until the judgment" (2 Peter
2.4), and Jude says that rebellious
have been kept by God "until the
judgment of the great day" (Jude 6). This means that at least the rebellious
angels
demons will be subject to judgment on that last day as well
Scripture does not clearly indicate whether righteous angels will
undergo some kind of evaluation of their service as well
but it is
possible that
are included in Paul's statement "Do yOu not
know that we are [0 judge
angels? -
(1 Cor: 6.3). It is probable that
this includes righteous angels because there is no indication in the
context that Paul
speaking of demons or fallen angels, and the
word
angel" without further qualification in the New Testament
would normally be understood t0 refer to righteous angels_
But the
text is not explicit enough t0 give uS certainty:
We Will Help in the Work of Judgment: It is
rather amazing aspect of
New Testament teaching that we (believers) will take part in the process of
judgment: Paul says:
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the
world is to be judged by YOu; are YOu incompetent t0 try trivial cases?
Do yOu nOt know that we are t0 judge
How much more ,
malters
pertaining
this life?
Cor: 6.2-3)
might be argued that this simply means we will be watching the
declaration of judgment by Christ and approving
but this does
not seem t0 fit the context well, for here Paul is encouraging the
Corinthians to settle legal disputes among themselves rather than
taking them
court before unbelievers. In this very context he
says,
Can it be that there is no man among YOu wise enough tO
decide between members of the brotherhood, but brother goes
law against brother; and that before unbelievers?" (1 Cor: 6.5
This kind of judgment certainly involves careful evaluation and
Wse
discernment: And this implies that such careful evaluation and
discernment will be exercised by US in judging angels and in
judging the world on the day of final judgment:
This is similar t0 the
teaching of Revelation 20, where John says
that he saw thrones, and
seated on them were those
whom
judgment was committed
(Rev: 20.4). Although the text does not
kepi
angels
they
angels? F
explain the identity of those seated on the thrones
the fact that
are mentioned in the plural indicates that Christ does not reserve
every aspect of the process of judging for himself alone. Indeed, he
tells his twelve disciples that they will "sit on twelve thrones_
judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (Matt: 19.28; compare Luke
22.30). This accords with the fact that throughout the history of
redemption God has from time tO time given the right to exercise
judgment into the hands of human authorities_
whether Moses and
the elders who assisted him, the judges of Israel whom God raised
up during the period of the judges; the wise kings such as David
and Solomon, the civil government of many nations
see Rom:
13.1-7;
Peter 2.13-14), 0r those who have authority t0 rule and
govern within the church and
oversee the exercise of church
discipline:
Necexiry of Final Judenent
Since when believers die they pass immediately into the presence of
God, and when unbelievers die they pass into
state of separation
from God and the endurance of punishment;
we may wonder why
God has
time of final judgment established at all. Berkhof wisely
points Out that the final judgment is not for the purpose of letting
God find out the condition of our hearts 0r the pattern of conduct of
our lives, for he already knows that in every detail. Berkhof rather
says of the final judgment:
Ic will serve the purpose rather of
displaying before all rational
creatures the declarative glory of God in
formal, forensic act; which
magnifies on the one hand His holiness and righteousness, and on the
other hand_
His grace and mercy Moreover; it should be borne in
mind that the
udgment at the last
will differ from that of the
death of each individual
more than one respect: It will not be secrer;
but public;
not pertain t0 the sOul only; but also t0 the body; it
will not have reference
single individual, but to all men.

Scripture clearly affirms that God will be entirely just in his
judgment and no one will be able to complain against him on that
day: God is the one who "judges each one impartially according to
his deeds
(1 Peter 1.17), and "God shows no partiality" (Rom_
2.11; compare Col. 3.25). For this reason, on the last day
every
they
day -
will
mouth" will be "stopped
and the whole world will be "held
accountable to God" (Rom: 3.19), with no one being able to
complain that God has treated him or her unfairly: In fact; one of
the great blessings of the final judgment will be that saints and
angels will see demonstrated in millions of
the absolutely pure
justice of God_
and this
source of praise t0 him for all
etemity At the time of the judgment on wicked Babylon, there will
be great praise in heaven, for John says,
heard what seemed t0 be
the loud voice of
multitude in heaven, crying; ' Hallelujah!
Salvation and glory and power belong
our God_
for his judgments
are true and just
"(Rev: 19.1-2).
Moral Apnlicutio
Final Judgnien
The doctrine of final judgment has several positive moral
influences in our lives_
The Doctrine of Final Judgment Satisfies Our Inward Sense of
Need
for Justice in the World: The fact that there will be
final judgment assures
us that ultimately God $ universe is fair; for God is in control, and he keeps
accurate records and renders just judgment When Paul tells slaves
submissive t0 their masters_
he reassures them; "For the wrongdoer will be
paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality
(Col 3.25).
When the picture of
final judgment mentions the fact that "books were
opened" (Rev: 20.12; compare Mal. 3.16),
reminds Us (whether the books
are literal or symbolic) that
permanent and accurate record of all our deeds
has been
by God_
and ultimately all accounts will be settled and all will
be made right:
2. The Doctrine of Final Judgment Enables Us to Forgive Others Freely
We realize that it is not Up [0 4S tO take revenge on others who have wronged
Or even [0 want t0 d SO
because God has reserved that
right for himself:
"Beloved_
neyel
avenge yourselves_
but leave it t0 the wrath of God_
tor it is
written;
Vengeance is mine,
repay; Says the Lord' "(Rom 12.19). In
this way whenever we have been wronged,
we can
give into God's hands any
desire to harm or pay back the person who has wronged 4S, knowing that
every wrong in the universe
ultimately be paid for
either it will turn out
[O have been
for by Christ when he died on the cross (if the wrongdoer
becomes
Christian), Or
will be
for at the final judgment (for those
who do not trust in Christ for salvation). But in either case we can give the
situation into God' s hands_
and then pray that the wrongdoer will trust Christ
for salvation and thereby receive forgiveness of his or her sins.

us from
harboring bitterness or resentment
our hearts for
injustices we have suffered that have not been made right: God is just, and we
can leave these situations in his hands, knowing that he will someday right all
wrongs and give absolutely fair rewards and punishments In this way we are
following in the example of Christ; who
when he was reviled_
he did nor
revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him
who judges justly
(1 Peter 2.22-23) He also prayed; "Father; forgive them,
know not whar
do" (Luke 23.34; compare Acts 7.60, where
Stephen followed Jesus' example in praying for those who put him to death)
The Doctrine of the Final
Judgment Provides
Motive for Righteous
For believers_
the final judgment is an incentive to faithfulness and
good works, not as
means of earning forgiveness of sins_
but as
means of
gaining greater eternal reward_
This is
healthy and good motive for uS
Jesus tells uS_
Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven'
(Matt. 6.20)
though it runs counter t0 the popular views of our secular culture
culture
that does not really believe in heaven or eternal rewards at all.
For unbelievers_
the doctrine of final judgment still provides some
moral restraint on their lives. If in
society there is
widespread
general acknowledgment that all will someday give account to the
Creator of the universe for their lives_
some "fear of God" will
characterize many people's lives
By contrast, those who have n0
deep consciousness of final judgment give themselves up
greater
and greater evil, demonstrating that "there is no fear of God before
their eyes" (Rom. 3.18). Those who deny the final judgment; Peter
says, will be
scoffers'
who
will come in the last days with
scoffing: following their own passions and
Where is the
promise of his coming?
"(2 Peter 33
He also declares that
evildoers who
are surprised that yOu do not nOw join them in the
same wild
profligacy;
and
who abuse you"
will nonetheless
give
account t0 him who is ready t0 judge the
and the dead"
Peter 4.4-5). An awareness of final judgment is both
comfort t0
believers and
waming
unbelievers not t0 continue in their
ways_
The Doctrine of Final Judgment Provides
Great Motive for
Evangelism: The decisions made by people in this life will affect their
destiny for all eternity, and it is right that our hearts feel and our mouths echo
the sentiment of the
appeal of God through Ezekiel, "Turn back, turn back
from your
ways; for why will YOu die_
0 house of Israel?
(Ezek 33.11).
In fact; Peter indicates that the delay of the Lord' $ retum

keep

saying;

God "is
forbearing toward you_
that any should perish, but that all
should reach repentance
(2 Peter 3.9).
It is appropriate t0 discuss the doctrine of hell in connection with
the doctrine of final judgment: We may define hell as follows: Hell
place of eternal conscious punishment for the wicked Scripture
teaches in several passages that there
such
place:
At the end of
the parable of the talents_
the master says, "Cast the worthless
servant into the outer darkness
there men
weep and
their
teeth'
(Matt. 25.30). This is one among several indications that
there will be consciousness of punishment after the final judgment:
Similarly, at the judgment the
will say tO some, "Depart from
me_
you cursed_
into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
angels'
(Matt: 25.41), and Jesus says that those thus condemned
"will g0 away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into
eternal life" (Matt 25.46).
In this text, the parallel
between
eternal life'
and
eternal punishment"
indicates thar both states
be without end_
Jesus refers t0 hell as "the unquenchable fire
(Mark 9.43), and
says that hell is
place
where their worm does not die_
and the fire
not quenched" (Mark 9.48).
The
of the rich man and
Lazarus also indicates
horrible consciousness of punishment:
The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hades, being in
torment; he lifted up his eyes_
and saw
Abraham far off and Lazarus in
his bosom; and he called out; "Father Abraham
have mercy upon me_
and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my
tongue; for
am in
anguish in this flame:
(Luke 16.22-24)
He then
Abraham t0 send Lazarus t0 his father'
house ,
"for
have five
brothers
S0 that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of
torment "
(Luke 16.28).
When we turn t0 Revelation, the descriptions of this eternal
punishment are also very explicit:
If anyone worships the beast and its image_
and receives
mark on his
forehead 0r on his hand, he also shall drink the wine of God $ wrath,
poured unmixed into the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented

and ever; and they have no rest, day or night; these worshipers of the
beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name
(Rev:
14.9-I1)
This passage very clearly affirms the idea of eternal conscious punishment of
unbelievers
With respect t0 the judgment on the wicked city of Babylon,
multitude in heaven cries_
"Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up
for ever and ever
(Rev: 19.3). After the final rebellion of Satan is
crushed;
read; "The devil who had deceived them was thrown
into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false
prophet were
and they will be tormented day and night for ever and
ever
(Rev 20:10). This passage is also significant in connection
with Matthew 25.41,in which unbelievers are sent "into the eternal
fire prepared for the devil and his angels
These verses should
make us realize the immensity of the evil that is found in sin and
rebellion against God, and the magnitude of the holiness and the
justice of God that calls forth this kind of punishment:
The idea that there will be eternal conscious punishment of
unbelievers has been denied recently even by some
evangelical
theologians:
It has previously been denied by the Seventh
Adventist Church and by various individuals throughout church
history Those who deny eternal conscious punishment often
advocate
annihilationism;
teaching that; after the wicked have
suffered the penalty of God's wrath for
time
God will
annihilate"
them s0 that they no longer exist
Many who believe
in annihilationism also hold to the reality of final judgment and
punishment for sin
but
argue that after sinners have suffered
for
certain period of time, bearing the wrath of God against their
sin, they will finally cease
exist_ The punishment will therefore
conscious
but ir will nor be
eternal.
Arguments advanced in favor of annihilationism are: (1) the biblical
references to the destruction of the wicked, which, some say,
implies that
will no longer exist after
are destroyed (Phil.
3.19;
Thess: 5.3;
[hess_
1.9;
Peter 3.7; et al.); (2) the apparent
inconsistency of eternal conscious punishment with the love of
large
Day
they

God;
the apparent injustice involved in the disproportion
sins committed in time and punishment that is eternal; and
the fact that the continuing presence of evil creatures in God $
universe will eternally mar the perfection of
universe that God
created t0 reflect his glory:
In response_
it must be said that the passages which
destruction
(such as Phil. 3.19;
Thess. 5.3; 2 Thess. 1.9; and
Peter 3.7) do not necessarily imply the cessation of existence_
these passages the terms used fOr
destruction" do not necessarily
imply
exist Or some kind of annihilation, but can
simply be ways of referring to the harmful and destructive effects of
final judgment on unbelievers:
With respect t0 the argument from the love of God, the same
difficulty in reconciling God's love with eternal punishment would
seem t0 be present in
reconciling God*s love with the idea of divine
punishment at all, and, conversely, if (as Scripture abundantly
testifies) it is consistent for God to punish the wicked for
certain
length of time after the last judgment, then there seems to be no
necessary reason why
would be inconsistent of God t0 inflict the
same
punishment for an unending period of time:
This kind of reasoning may lead some people to adopt another kind
of annihilationism; one in which there is no conscious
suffering
all, not even for
brief time
and the only punishment is that
unbelievers cease
exist after they die. But; in response, it may be
wondered whether this kind of immediate annihilation can really be
called
punishment; since there would be no consciousness f
In fact; the guarantee that there would be
cessation of existence
seem t0 many people, especially those who are
suffering and
in difficulty in this life, t0 be in some ways
desirable alternative_
And if there was no punishment of unbelievers at all; even people
like Hitler and Stalin would have nothing coming to them; and there
would be no ultimate justice in the universe. Then people would
have great incentive to be as wicked as possible in this life.
The argument that eternal punishment
untair (because there is
disproportion between temporary sin and eternal punishment)
wrongly assumes that we know the extent of the evil done when
sinners rebel against God. David Kingdon observes that
sin against
the Creator is heinous t0

Who would have the
temerity
suggest
God whar the punishment
should be?"
He also responds to this objection by suggesting that unbelievers in
hell may go on sinning and
receiving punishment for their sin, but
never repenting-
and notes that Revelation 22:11 points in this
direction:
Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be
filthy:
At this point; moreover; an argument based on God's justice may be
brought against annihilationism
Does the short time of punishment
envisaged by the annihilationist actually pay for all of the
unbeliever
sin and satisfy God $ justice? If it does nOt; then God $
justice has not been satisfied and the unbeliever should not be
annihilated. But if it does_
then the unbeliever should be allowed [0
g0 to heaven, and he or she should not be annihilated_
In either
case, annihilationism is not necessary or right:
Regarding the fourth argument, while evil that remains unpunished

we also mUSt realize
that when God punishes evil and triumphs over it; the glory of his
justice, righteousness, and power t0 triumph over all opposition will
be seen (see Rom. 9.17,22-24). The depth of the riches of God's
mercy

recognize that
tOo deserve such punishment from God and
have avoided
only by God $ grace through Jesus Christ (cf:
Rom.
9.23-24).

When Paul thinks of the lostness of his kinsmen the
Jews
he says, "[ have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my

(Rom: 9.2). This is consistent with what God tells us of his
own sorrow ar the death of the wicked:

God;

It may help us to realize that if God were not t0 execute eteral

his glory would not be furthered in the way he deems wise. And it
will perhaps also help us tO realize that from the perspective of the
world t0 come there is
much greater recognition of the necessity
and rightness of eternal punishment Martyred believers in heaven
are heard by John to cry out;
0 sovereign Lord, holy and true; how
before YOu will judge and avenge our blood on those who
dwell upon the earth?" (Rev: 6.10)_
Moreover; at the final
destruction of Babylon; the loud voice of

heaven cries out with praise
God for the rightness of his
judgment as they finally see the heinous nature of evil for what it
really is:

Have you previously thought very much about laying Up treasures in

this doctrine_
what kind of effect do YOu think it should have on your
life?
How do Yu think it will feel
to participate with Christ in the judging of
angels, and indeed in the judging of the whole world (see
Cor: 6.2-3)?
What does the fact that God allows us tO participate in this final
judgment say about our creation in the image of God and his purposes
for US in the universe? How does that make you feel about yourself and
your eternal relationship to God?
Think of some of your Christian friends in your church: How do you
think you will feel when you watch them stand before Christ
the final
judgment? How will they feel about you at that time? Does the
contemplation of this future judgment affect the way you think of your
fellowship with each other
brothers and sisters in Christ today?
Are yOU
that there will be
final judgment of both believers and
unbelievers? Does it make YOu feel
sense of God's justice, or do you
sense some unfairness and injustice in the whole idea?
Are you convinced that Scripture teaches that there will be eternal
conscious punishment of the wicked? When YOu think of that idea in

Satan and demons; do you feel that it is right?
Is there anyone who has wronged you in the past; and whom you have
had difficulty forgiving? Does the doctrine of final judgment help you to
be more able to forgive that person?

The New Heavens and New Earth
What is heaven? Is it a place? How will the earth be renewed?
What will it be like
live in the new heavens and new
EAFL
ANATION AND SCRIPTURAL BASIS
We Will Live Eternally With God in New Hear
ensand
New Earth
After the final judgment; believers will enter into the full enjoyment
of life in the presence of God forever: Jesus
say [0 4S,
Come,
blessed of my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for YOu from
the foundation of the world" (Matt: 25.34). We will enter
kingdom where
there shall no more be
anything accursed
buc the
throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall
worship him" (Rev. 22.3)
When
referring
to this place_
Christians often talk about
with
God "in heaven'
forever: But in fact the biblical teaching is richer
than that: it tells us that there will be new heavens and
new earth
-an entirely renewed creation
aand we will live with God there.
The Lord promises through Isaiah;
For behold,
create new
heavens and
new earth; and the former
shall not be
remembered" (Isa. 65.17), and
of "the new heavens and the
new earth which
will make'
(Isa. 66.22). Peter says_
according to
his promise we wait for new heavens and
new earth in which
righteousness dwells" (2 Peter 3.13). In John s vision of events to
follow the final judgment; he says_
"Then
saw
new heaven and
new
earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away"
(Rev 21:1). He goes on t0 tell 4S that there will also be
new kind
of unification of heaven and earth; for he sees the holy city; the
new Jerusalem;
coming
down out of heaven from God" (Rev:
21.2), and hears
voice proclaiming that "the dwelling of God is
with men. He will dwell with them; and they shall be his people
and God himself will be with them'
(v 3). So there will be
joining of heaven and earth in this new creation, and there we will

will.
living

speaks
live in the presence of God
What Is Heaven? During this present age,
the place where God dwells is
frequently called "heaven'
Scripture. The Lord says
"Heaven is my
throne
(Isa. 66.1) , and Jesus teaches uS to pray; "Our Father who art in
heaven"
(Matt_ 6.9). Jesus nOw
has
into heaven, and is at the right hand
of God"
Peter 3.22). In fact; heaven may be defined as follows: Heaven is
the place where God most fully makes known his presence t0 bless.
We discussed earlier how God
present everywhere
but how he
especially manifests his presence t0 bless in certain places.
The
greatest manifestation of God's presence to bless is seen in heaven;
where he makes his glory known, and where angels_
Other heavenly
crealures_
and redeemed saints all worship him_
2. Heaven Is a Place, Not Just
State of Mind.
But someone may wonder
how heaven can be joined together with earth. Clearly the earth is a place that
exists at
certain location in our space-time universe, but can heaven also be
thought of as
place that can be joined to the earth?
Outside of the evangelical world the idea of heaven as _
place is
often denied, chiefly because its existence can only be known from
the testimony of Scripture. Recently even some evangelical
scholars have been hesitant t0 atfirm the fact that heaven is
place:
Should the fact that we only know about heaven from the
Bible_
and cannot give any empirical evidence for it, be
reason noI
believe that heaven is
real place?
The New Testament teaches the idea of
location for heaven in
several different ways, and quite clearly When Jesus ascended into
heaven; the fact that he went [0
place seems t0 be the entire
of the narrative
and the point that Jesus intended his disciples to
understand by the way in which he gradually ascended even while
speaking to them: "As they were looking on, he was lifted Up, and
cloud took him out of their sighr" (Acts 1.9; cf: Luke 24.51: "While
he blessed them, he parted from them") The angels exclaimed,
"This Jesus
who was taken up from yOu into heaven, will come in
the same way as YOu saw him go into heaven
(Acts 1.11). It is hard
imagine how the fact of Jesus
ascension [0
place could be
taught more clearly:
similar conclusion can be drawn from the
of Stephen's
gore
point
story
death: Just before he was stoned
he; "full of the Holy Spirit, gazed
into heaven and saw the
lory of God, and Jesus standing at the
right hand of God; and he said,
Behold,
see the heavens opened;
and the Son of Man
at the right hand of God' "(Acts 7.55
56) . He did not see mere symbols of
state of existence
Ic seems
rather that his

see
spiritual dimension of
reality which God has hidden from US in this present age_
dimension which nonetheless really does exist in our space/time
universe, and within which Jesus now lives in his physical
resurrection body; waiting even now for the time when he
return [0 earth_
Moreover; the fact that we will have resurrection
bodies like Christ'$ resurrection body indicates that heaven will be
place, for in such physical bodies (made perfect; never to become
weak or die again) ,
inhabit
specific place at
time, just as Jesus nOw does in his resurrection body:
The idea of heaven as
place is also the easiest sense in which to
understand Jesus
promise, "[ go to prepare
place for you" (John
14.2) . He speaks quite clearly of going from his existence in this
world back to the Father; and then returning again:
And when
and prepare
place for you
will come again and will take you tO
myself; that where
am YOu may be also"
(John 14.3)
These texts lead uS t0 conclude that heaven is even now
place
though one whose location is nOw unknown t0 Us and whose
existence is nOw unable tO be perceived by our natural senses_
Ic is
this place of God'$
dwelling that will be somehow made new at the
time of the final judgment and will be joined to
renewed earth:
3. The Physical Creation Will Be Renewed and We Will Continue to Exist
and Act in It: In addition t0
renewed heaven, God will make
new earth"
Peter 3.13; Rev: 21:1).
Several
passages indicate that the physical creation
be renewed in
significant way. "The creation waits with eager longing
for the revealing of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility;
not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; because
the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the
glorious
of the children of God
(Rom: 8.19-21).
But will earth simply be renewed_
o1 will it be completely destroyed
and replaced by another earth, newly created by God? Some
passages appear

102) tells uS of the heavens and earth;
They
will perish
but YOu remain; they will all grow old like
garment;
like
mantle you will roll them Up, and they
changed"
(Heb. 1.11-12). Later he tells us that God has promised, "Yet once
more
will shake not only the earth but also the heaven;
shaking
SO severe aS t0 involve "the removal of what is shaken
in Order
that what cannot be shaken may remain" (Heb:
12.26-27)
Peter
says; "The day of the Lord will come like
thief; and then the
heavens will pass away with
loud noise, and the elements will be
dissolved with
and the earth and all the works that are upon it
will be burned up
(2 Peter 3.10).
similar picture is found in
Revelation, where John says_
"From his presence earth and sky fled
away; and no place was found for them" (Rev 20:11). Moreover;
John says_
Then
saw
new heaven and
new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth had passed away; and the sea was no
more
(Rev: 21:1).
Within the Protestant world, there has been
disagreement
a5 [0
whether the earth is to be destroyed completely and replaced, or just
changed and renewed. Berkhof says that Lutheran scholars have
emphasized the fact that it will be an entirely new creation, while
Reformed scholars have tended t0 emphasize those verses that say
simply that this present creation will be renewed_
The Reformed
position seems preferable here
for it is difficult t0 think that God
would entirely annihilate his original creation, thereby seeming tO
give the devil the last word and scrapping the creation that was
originally
good" (Gen: 1.31). The passages above that speak
and removing the earth and of the first earth passing
away may simply refer t0 its existence in its present form; not its
very existence itself; and even 2 Peter 3.10,which speaks of the
elements
dissolving and the earth and the works on it P
burned
4P, may not be speaking of the earth as a planet but rather the
surface things on the
(that is, much of the ground and the
things on the ground)_
Our Resurrection Bodies Will Be Part of the Renewed Creation: In the
new heavens and new earth, there will be
place and activities fOr our
resurrection bodies, which will never grow old or become weak
ill. A
strong consideration in favor of this viewpoint is the fact that God made the
original physical creation
(Gen. 1.31). There is therefore
inherently sinful or evil or "unspiritual" about the physical world that God
made or the creatures that he put in it, or about the
physical bodies that he

nothing
gave uS at creation. Though all these
have been marred and distorted
by sin, God will not completely destroy the physical world (which would be
acknowledgement that sin had frustrated and defeated God's purposes), but
rather he will perfect the entire creation and bring it into harmony with the
purposes for which he originally created it: Therefore we can expect that in
the new heavens and new earth there will be
tully pertect earth that is once
again
very good =
And we can expect that we will have physical bodies that
will once
be "very
in God $ sight; and that will function to fulfill
the purposes for which he originally placed man on the earth.
When the author of Hebrews says that we do
not
see
everything
in subjection to man (Heb: 2.8), he implies that
eventually all
will eventually be subject t0 US, under the
kingship of the man Christ Jesus (note
9: "But we see Jesus
crowned with glory and honor"F
This will fulfill God's original
plan
have everything in the world subject to the human beings
that he had made_
In this sense
then
we will "inherit the earth"
(Matt: 5.5) and reign over
God originally intended_
For that reason, it should not strike Us as surprising to find that
some
of the descriptions of life in heaven include features that are
very much part of the physical or material creation that God has
made_
We shall eat and drink at "the marriage supper of the Lamb"
(Rev: 19.9). Jesus will once
drink wine with his disciples
the heavenly kingdom (Luke 22:18)-
The "river of the water of life"
will flow "from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the
middle of the street of the city
(Rev: 22:1). The tree of life will
bear "twelve kinds of fruit;
yielding its fruit each month'
(Rev:
22.2) . There is no strong reason tO say these expressions are merely
symbolic,
without any literal reference:
Are symbolic banquets and
symbolic wine and symbolic rivers and trees somehow superior to
real banquets and real wine and real rivers and trees in God's
eteral plan? These
are just some of the excellent features of
the perfection and final goodness of the physical creation that God
has made_
Of course, there are symbolic descriptions in the book of
Revelation, and it is inevitable that at some points
will be
unable t0 decide whether
something
is to be taken symbolically or
literally. But it does not seem difficult to think that the description
of the heavenly city with gates and
wall and foundations is
description of something that is literal and real,
holy city

And the
of the earth shall bring their glory into it, and its gates shall
never be shut by day-
and there shall be no night there; they shall
bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations"
(Rev: 21.21-
26).
While we may have some uncertainty about the understanding of
certain derails; it does not seem inconsistent with this picture to say
that we will ear and drink in the new heavens and new earth, and
cany on other physical activities as well. Music certainly is
prominent in the descriptions of heaven in Revelation, and we
might imagine that both musical and artistic activities would be
done to the glory of God. Perhaps people will work at the whole
range of investigation and development of the creation by
technological, creative, and inventive means
thus
exhibiting the
full extent of their excellent creation in the image of God.
Moreover; since God is
and
can never exhaust his
greatness (Ps. 145.3), and since
are tinite creatures who
never
equal God's knowledge or be omniscient;
may expect
that for all eternity we
will be able t0 go on learning more about
God and about his relationship t0 his creation_
this way we will
continue the process of
that was
begun in this life, in
which
life "fully pleasing to him
is one that includes continually
"increasing in the knowledge of God" (Col. 1:10).
The New Creation Will Not Be " Timeless
but Will Include an
Unending Succession of Moments. Although
popular hymn speaks of the
time
when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more_
Scripture does not give support to that idea Certainly the heavenly city that
receives itS
light from the glory of God (Rev: 21.23) will never experience
darkness or night:
There shall be no night there
(Rev: 21.25)_
But this does
not mean that heaven will be
place where time
unknown;
where things
cannot be done one after another: Indeed, all the pictures of heavenly worship
in the book of Revelation include words that are spoken one after another in
coherent sentences
and actions (such as
falling down before God s throne and
casting crowns before his throne) that involve
sequence of events
When we
rego
that "the kings of the earth

implication of the fact that the tree of life has twelve kinds of fruit; "yielding

(Rev. 22.2). (On Rev: 10:6 see chapter 11,p. 219,
18.)
Since
we are finite creatures
might also expect that we will
always live in
succession of moments. Just aS we will never attain
God $ omniscience Or' omnipresence; SO we shall never attain to
God's eternity in the sense of seeing all time equally vividly and not

being limited by time:

rather live in

When we consider the fact that this present creation is
temporary
one and that our life in the new creation will last for eterity; we
have
strong motivation for godly living and for living in such
way as [0 store up treasures in heaven: In
reflecting on the fact that
heaven and earth will be destroyed,
says the
following:
Since all these things are thus to be dissolved_

according 5
his promise we wait for new heavens and

And Jesus very
explicitly tells us:
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures 0n earth; where moth and rust
consume and where thieves break
and steal, but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, Where neither moth nOr rust consumes and where
thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also. (Matt: 6.19-21)

Amid all the questions that we naturally have concerning the new
heavens and new earth;
muSt not lose sight of the fact that
Scripture consistently portrays this new creation as
place of great
beauty and joy: In the description of heaven in Revelation 21 and
22,this theme
repeatedly affirmed: It is
~holy city" (21.2),
place "prepared as
bride adomed for her husband" (21.2). In that

death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor
crying nor pain any more
(21.4). There we can drink
the
fountain of the water of life without payment" (21:6). It is
city
that has "the glory of God, its radiance like
most rare
jewel, like
jasper; clear as
(21:11). It is _
city of immense size_
whether the measurements be understood as literal 0r symbolic: Its
length measures
12,000 stadia" (21.16), or about 1,400 miles
250 kilometers), and "its length and breadth and height are
equal" (21.6). Parts of the city are constructed of immense precious
jewels of various colors (21.18-21). It will be free from all evil, for
unclean shall enter it, nor anyone who practices
abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the
Lamb s book of life" (21:7). In that city we shall also have
positions of rule over God's entire creation, for "they shall reign for
ever and ever" (22.5).
But more important than all the physical beauty of the heavenly
city, more important than the fellowship we will enjoy eternally
with all God '$ people from all nations and all periods in history;
more important than our freedom from pain and sorrow and
physical
suffering_
and more important than reigning over God $
kingdom
more important by far than any of these will be the fact
that we will be in the presence of God and enjoying unhindered
fellowship with him. "Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He
will dwell with them, and
shall be his people, and God himself
will be with them; he will wipe away every tear from their eyes"
(21.3-4).
In the Old Testament, when the glory of God filled the temple, the
priests were unable to stand and minister (2 Chron. 5.14). In the
New Testament, when the glory of God surrounded the shepherds
in the field outside Bethlehem "they were filled with fear" (Luke
2.9). But here in the heavenly city
will be able t0 endure the
power and holiness of the presence of God's glory, for we will live
continually in the atmosphere of the glory of God
And the city
has no need of sun or moon to shine upon
for the glory of God is
its light; and its
is the Lamb
(21.23).
This will be the
fulfillment of God'$ purpose to call us "to his own glory and
excellence'
(2 Peter 1.3): then we shall dwell continually in
'[he
presence of his glory with rejoicing
(Jude 1.24; cf: Rom. 3.23;
8.18; 9.23;
Cor: 15.43;
Cor: 3.18; 4.17; Col. 3.4;

Heb. 2.10;

In that city we shall live in the presence of God, for

God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship
him" (22.3). From time to time here on earth we experience the joy
genuine worship of God, and we realize that it is our highest joy
be giving him glory. But in that city this joy will be multiplied
many times over and
will know the fulfillment of that for which
we were created_
Our greatest joy will be
the Lord himself
and in being with him forever: When John speaks of the
of the heavenly city; the culmination of those blessings comes in the
short statement; "They shall see his face
(22.4). When we look
into the face of our Lord and he looks back at uS with infinite love_
we will see in him the fulfillment of
everything that we know to be
and right and desirable in the universe. In the face
God
will see the fulfillment of all the longing we have ever had to know
perfect love; peace, and joy; and t0 know truth and justice, holiness
and wisdom, goodness and power; and glory and beauty As we
gaze into the face of our Lord,
will know more fully than ever
before that
in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right
hand are pleasures for evermore
(Ps. 16.11). Then will be fulfilled
the
longing of our hearts with which we have cried Out in the past,
"One thing
have asked of the Lord_
that will
seek after; that
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the
of my life_
[0 behold
the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple" (Ps. 27.4).
When we finally see the Lord face to face,
hearts will want
else_
Whom have
in heaven but vou? And there is
nothing upon earth that
desire besides you_
God is the strength
of my heart and my portion forever" (Ps. 73.25-26). Then with joy
our hearts and voices will join with the redeemed from all ages and
with the mighty armies of heaven singing; "Holy, holy, holy; is the
Lord God Almighty; who
and is and is
comel " (Rev. 4.8).
QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL APPLICATION
In your Christian life t0 this point; have YOu spent much time
thinking
about life in the new heavens and new earth? Do you think there is
very strong longing for this in your heart? If it has not been strong; why
do you think this has been the case?
In what ways has this chapter made You more excited about entering the
heavenly city? What positive effects on your Christian life do you think
would come about because of
stronger longing for the life to come?
Are you convinced that the new creation is

What are some ways in which you already have stored up treasure in
heaven rather than on earth? Are there more ways YOu could do that in

Historic Confessions of Faith
This appendix reprints several of the most significant confessions of faith
from various periods in the history of the church_
From the ancient church
have included the four great ecumenical confessions: the Apostles' Creed
(third-fourth centuries
A.D.), the Nicene Creed (AD. 325/381), the
Athanasian Creed (late fourth-early fifth century A.D.); and the Chalcedonian
Creed (AD. 451). From the Protestant churches since the Reformation
have
included four other contessions_
the Thirty-nine Articles (1571) [Church of
England; also Methodist]; the Westminster Confession of Faith (1643-1646)
[British Reformed and Presbyterian]; the New Hampshire Baptist Confession
1833); and the Baptist Faith and Message (1925/1963) [Southern Baptist].
Finally;
have also included the
Statement on Biblical Inerrancy
(1978), because it was the product of
conference representing
broad
variety of evangelical traditions_
and because
has gained widespread
acceptance as
valuable doctrinal standard concerning an issue
recent and
current controversy in the church:
Because of space
limitations_
was able t0 include only one of the
confessions of faith that came out of the Reformation, and
chose the
Westminster Confession of Faith; which represents
doctrinal position very
close t0 the position of this book: This meant that
did not have space to
include either of the two great Lutheran confessions, the Augsburg
Confession (1530) or the Formula of Concord (1576).
Students who take the time
read these creeds thoughtfully will find that
they provide excellent summaries of the doctrinal teachings of Scripture:

inconfusedly; unchangeably; indivisibly, inseparably; the distinction of natures
being by no means [aken away by the union, but rather the property of each
nature being preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence,
not
parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son; and only
begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the
beginning have declared concerning him, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself

Spirit incomprehensible_
The Father eternal: the Son eternal: and the Holy Spirit eternal.
And yet
are nOr three eternals: but one eternal:
And also there are not three uncreated: nor three incomprehensibles_
but
one uncreated: and one incomprehensible.
So likewise the Father is Almighty: the Son Almighty: and the Holy
Spirit Almighty:
And yet
are not three Almighties: but one Almighty:
So the Father is God: the Son is God: and the Holy Spirit is God.
And yet
are nOr three Gods: but one God:
So likewise the Father is Lord: the Son Lord: and the
Spirit Lord:
And yet not three Lords: but one Lord_
For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge
every Person by himself to be God and Lord:
So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion:
say, There be three
Gods
three Lords
The Father is made of none: neither created, nor
begotten.
The Son is of the Father alone: nOr made;
nor created: but
begotten:
The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son: neither made, nor
created_
nor begotten: but
proceeding:
So there is one Father; nor three Fathers: one Son, not three Sons: one
Holy Spirit; not three Holy Spirits_
And in this Trinity none
afore,
after another: none is greater; O1 less
than another:
But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal:
So that in all things,
as aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in
Unity, is t0 be worshipped_
He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity:
Furthermore it is necessary t0
everlasting salvation: that he also believe
rightly the Incaration of our Lord Jesus Christ:
For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess:
that our Lord Jesus
Christ; the Son of God, is God and Man;
God, of the Substance of the Father; begotten before the worlds: and
Man, of the Substance of his Mother; born in the world:
Perfect God: and perfect Man, of
reasonable soul and human flesh
subsisting
Equal t0 the Father; as
touching his Godhead: and inferior
the Father
as touching his Manhood:
they
they
they
Holy
Who although he be God and Man; yet he is not LWo
but one Christ
One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh: but by taking of the
Manhood into God_
One altogether; not by confusion of Substance:
but by unity of Person.
For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man
one
Christ;
Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hell: rose again the third
from the dead_
He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the Father God
Almighty:
From whence he shall come t0 judge the quick and the dead.
At whose coming all men shall rise
with their bodies;
And shall give account for their own works
And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that
have done evil; into
everlasting fire:
This is the Catholic Faith: which except
man believe faithfully; he can
nor be saved_

Original Sin standeth not in the
following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption t0 the Nature of every man, that
naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far
gone from original righteousness, and is of his Own nature inclined to evil, so
that the flesh lusteth always contrary t0 the spirit; and therefore in every
person born into this world, it deserveth God $ wrath and damnation. And this
infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the
lust of the flesh, called in the Greek phronema sarkos (which some do
expound the wisdom, some sensuality; some of the affection_
some of the
desire_
of the flesh) , is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is

no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized; yet the Apostle doth
confess_
that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin_
Feeatn
The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannor turn and
prepare himself; by his own natural strength and good works; to faith; and
calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power t0 do good works pleasant
and
acceptable to God
without the grace of God by Christ preventing 4S, that
we may have
good will, and working with uS, when we have that good will:
We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith; and not for OUF Own works 0r deservings.
Wherefore; that we are justified by Faith only; is
most wholesome Doctrine,
and
full of comfort; as more largely is expressed
the Homily of
Justification_
XILOl Goud Works
Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
Justification, cannot put away Our sins
and endure the severity of God'$
judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ; and do
spring out necessarily of
tnue and lively faith; insomuch that by them
lively Faith may be as evidently known as
tree discerned by the fruit:
ULncelnre nacentinn
Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit; are
not pleasant to God_
forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ;
neither do they make men meet to receive grace, Or (as the School-authors
say) deserve grace of
congruity: yea rather; for that they are not done as God
hath willed and commanded them t0 be done_
we doubt not but they have the
nature of sin:
Alnti

Voluntary Works besides, over and above_
God $ Commandments , which
call Works of Supererogation_
cannor be
taught without arrogancy and
impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as
much as they are bound t0 do, but that they do more for his sake, than ot
bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all
that are commanded t0 You

should take away the sins of the world; and sin; (as Saint John saith) was not

Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be

Predestination t0 Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the
foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel
secret
deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen
in Christ out of mankind
and
bring them by Christ [0 everlasting salvation,
as vessels made t0 honour: Wherefore_
which be endued with s0
excellent
benefit of God, be called
according-
to God'$ purpose by his Spirit
working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified
freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of
his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ:
walk religiously in
works; and
at length; by God' =
mercy; they attain
everlasting felicity:
As the
godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is
full of sweet; pleasant; and unspeakable comfort to godly persons
and such as
feel in themselves the working of the Spirit
Christ, mortifying the works of
the flesh, and their earthly members
and drawing up their mind t0 high and
heavenly
as well because it doth
greatly establish and confirm their
faith of eternal Salvation t0 be enjoyed through Christ; as because it doth
fervently kindle their love towards God: So_

It is

XXl Ofthc Sacraicnt.
Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian
men'$
profession; but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs
of grace
and God's good will toward us
by the which he doth work invisibly
in 4S, and doth not only quicken, but also
strengthen and confirm our Faith in
him.
There are tWo Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is t0
say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord:
Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is t0 say, Confirmation,
Penance_
Orders, Matrimony; and Extreme Unction, are not t0 be counted for
Sacraments of the Gospel,
such as have grown partly of the corrupt
following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures;
but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord' $
Supper; for that
have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God
The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon; Or to be carried

And in such only as worthily receive

Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the
and
sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and
Sacraments
yet forasmuch as
do not the same
their own name, but in
Christ' $_
and do minister by his commission and authority; we may use their
Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving the Sacraments_
Neither is the effect of Christ'$ ordinance taken away by their wickedness_
the grace of God'$ gifts diminished from such as by faith, and rightly, do
receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of
Christ"
institution and promise; although they be ministered by evil men_
Nevertheless_
appertaineth to the discipline of the Church; that inquiry be
made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have
knowledge of their offences
and finally; being found guilty; bY just judgment
be deposed_
XXVIL Of Baptism
Baptism is nOt only
sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened_
but it is also
sign of Regeneration Or New-Birth; whereby; as by an instrument;
that
receive Baptism rightly are
into the Church; the promises of
forgiveness of sin; and of our adoption t0 be the sons of God by the
Spirit; are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased
by virtue of prayer unto God_
The Baptism of young Children is in any wise
be retained in the Church, as most
agreeable with the institution of Christ
MbaaLort
The Supper of the Lord is not only
sign of the love that Christians ought t0
have among themselves one to another; but rather it is
Sacrament of our
Redemption by Christ'$ death: insomuch thar
such as rightly; worthily, and
faith, receive the same_
the Bread which we break is
partaking of the
Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is
partaking of the Blood
of Christ:

received and eaten in the Supper; is Faith

XXX Of Both Kinds.
The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts
of the Lord's Sacrament; by Christ'$ ordinance and commandment, ought t0

XXXI Of the One Oblation of Christ Finished Upon the Cross:
The
Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption; propitiation, and
satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and
there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices
of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer Christ
for the quick and the dead, t0 have remission of pain or

These angels and men, thus predestinated, and foreordained_
are
particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number s0 certain and
definite, that
cannor be either increased 0r diminished:
Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God; before the
foundation of the world was laid,
according-
his eternal and immutable
purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen, in
Christ; unto everlasting glory; out of his mere free grace and love; without any

As God hath appointed the elect unto glory; so hath he, by the eternal and
most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto.
Wherefore, they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by
Christ; are effectually called unto faith in Christ by his Spirit working in due
season; are
justified, adopted_
sanctified, and kept by his power; through faith,
unto salvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called,
justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only:

8. The doctrine of this
mystery of predestination is to be handled with
special prudence and care_
that men, attending the will of God revealed in his
Word, and yielding obedience thereunto_
may; from the certainty of their

afford matter of praise

1. They; whom God hath accepted in his Beloved, effectually called, and
sanctified by his Spirit; can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state
of grace
but shall certainly persevere therein t0 the end, and be eternally

2. This perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own free will, but
upon the immutability of the decree of election, flowing from the free and
unchangeable love of God the Father; upon the efficacy of the merit and
intercession f Jesus Christ; the abiding of the Spirit; and of the seed of God
within them, and the nature of the covenant of grace: from all which ariseth
also the certainty and infallibility thereof:

Beside this law; commonly called moral, God was pleased to give t0 the
people of Israel, as
church under age, ceremonial laws, containing several
typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces_

sufferings, and benefits; and partly; holding forth divers instructions of moral
duties. All which ceremonial laws are now abrogated, under the New

of the matter contained in
it; but also in respect of the authority of God the Creator; who

doth Christ, in the gospel, any way dissolve, but much strengthen this
obligation:
Although true believers be not under the law, as

thereby justified, or condemned; yet is it of great use t0 them; as well as to
others; in thal; as

Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths andl Voits
1. A lawful oath is
of religious worship, wherein, upon just occasion;,
the person swearing solemnly calleth God t0 witness what he asserteth, or
promiseth, and t0
him according t0 the truth or falsehood of what he
sweareth:
2. The name of God only is that by which men ought t0 swear; and therein it
is t0 be used with all holy fear and reverence.
Therefore, to swear vainly; or
rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; Or; t0 swear at all by any other
thing; is sinful, and to be abhorred. Yet; as in matters of weight and moment;
an oath is warranted by the Word of God_
under the New Testament as well as
under the Old; so
lawful oath,
imposed by lawful authority; in such
matters, ought
be taken.
3. Whosoever taketh an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness of 50
solemn an aCt; and therein t0 avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is
the truth: neither may any man bind himself by oath t0 anything but what is
good and just, and what he believeth so to be, and what he is able and
resolved t0 perform:
An oath is t0 be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without

6. It is not t0 be made t0 any creature_
but to God alone: and, that it may be
accepted, it is t0 be made voluntarily, out of faith, and conscience of
way of thankfulness for mercy received, or for the
obtaining
of what we want;
whereby we more strictly bind ourselves

things, so farand so long as they may fitly conduce thereunto.
7. No man may VOW to do
anything forbidden in the Word of God, or what
would hinder any duty therein commanded, 0r which is not in his Own power;
and for the performance whereof he hath no promise of ability from God_
which respects, popish monastical vows of perpetual single life, professed
poverty; and regular obedience; are so far from being degrees of higher

that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian

without violence or danger: And, as Jesus Christ hath appointed

DECLARATION OF FAITH
WI tne Scrptures
We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired, and is a
perfect treasure of heavenly instruction; that it has God for its author;
salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture of error for its matter; that
it reveals the principles by which God will judge us; and therefore is, and
shall remain t0 the end of the world
the true center of Christian union, and
the supreme standard by which all human conduct; creeds
and opinions
should be tried.

divine perfection; and executing distinct and harmonious offices in the great

that it is the immediate duty of all to accept them by

which rejection involves him in an aggravated condemnation:

Salvation
Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man

all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour; who by His Own blood
obtained eternal redemption for the believer: In its broadest sense salvation
includes regeneration, sanctification, and glorification:
Regeneration,
the new birth; is
work of God's grace whereby believers
become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is_
change of heart wrought by the
Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, t0 which the sinner responds in
repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ:
Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace. Repentance is
genuine
from sin [Oward God:
Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ
and commitment of the entire personality t0 Him as

THE CHICAGO STATEMENT ON
BIBLICAL INERRANCY
(1978)
PREFACE
The authority of Scripture is
key issue for the Christian Church in this and
every age. Those who profess faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are
called to show the reality of their discipleship by humbly and faithfully
obeying God's written Word. To stray from Scripture in faith or conduct is
disloyalty to our Master: Recognition of the total truth and trustworthiness of
Holy Scripture is essential tO
full grasp and adequate confession of its
authority:
The following Statement affirms this inerrancy of Scripture afresh; making
clear our understanding of it and warning against its denial. We are persuaded
that [0
it is t0 set aside the witness of Jesus Christ and of Holy Spirit and
[0 refuse that submission t0 the claims of God $ own word which marks tnue
Christian faith_
We see it as OUL timely
to make this affirmation in the
face of current lapses from the truth of inerrancy among our fellow Christians
and
misunderstanding of this doctrine in the world at
Statement consists of three parts:
Summary Statement; Articles of
Affirmation and Denial, and an accompanying Exposition. It has been
prepared in the course of
three-day consultation in Chicago. Those who
have signed the Summary Statement and the Articles wish to affirm their Own
conviction aS t0 the inerrancy of Scripture and to encourage and challenge
one another and all Christians to growing appreciation and
understanding of
this doctrine:
We acknowledge the limitations of

brief, intensive conference and do not propose that this Statement be given
creedal weight
Yet we rejoice in the

upon which it touches: it is to be believed, as God s instruction, in all that it
affirms; obeyed_
as God $ command
in all that it requires; embraced_
God'$ pledge; in all that
promises_

Arminius (1560-1609) was
Reformed pastor in Amsterdam and
later professor of
at the University of Leyden: His
disagreement with some of the central
tenets of Calvinism led tO
controversy in the Netherlands which continued long after his
death_
His ideas became the foundation of
system of thought now
known as Arminianism; which continues today in conservative
Wesleyan and Methodist churches, and in many other Protestant
groups. This collection of writings, assembled after his death, is not
strictly organized as
systematic theology; but does contain
discussions of most important theologica
topics.

The Monogenes Controversy:
"Only" or "Only Begotten"?
(See Chapter 14, "God in Three Persons: The Trinity;
especially C.Z.a,
Arian Controversy;
in Chapter 12. See also the Nicene Creed in the
beginning of chapter 48.
The controversy over the term
only begotten'
was unnecessary because it
was based on
misunderstanding of the meaning of the Greek word
monogenems (used of Jesus in John 1:14, 18; 3.16, 18; and
John 4.9).
For many years it was thought to be derived from two Greek terms: mono_
meaning
only;
and gennao, meaning
beget" or "bear:
Even the received
version of the Nicene Creed understands
that way; since the explanatory
phrases
begotten of the Father before all worlds
and
"begotten, not made'
both use the verb gennao (beget) to explain monogenes_
But linguistic study
in the [wentieth
Lemluty
has shown that the second half of the word
nor
closely related to the verb gennao (beget; bear)
but rather [0 the term genos
(class; kind)_
Thus the word means rather the "one-of-a-kind" Son 0r the
unique'
Son. (See BAGD, 527; D. Moody; "The Translation of John 3.16 in
the Revised Standard Version;
JBL 72 [1953], 213-19.) The idea of
only-
begotten'
in Greek would have been, not monogenes_
but monogennetos_
However; it is not impossible that the Nicene fathers in AD.325 and 381
would have understood monogenes t0 include the idea of
begetting;
since
the word is used severa
times elsewhere
refer [0 someone who is an
only'
child
and the idea of begetting could commonly be assumed to be present
The fact that the word does not mean "the only son that someone has
begotten'
can be confirmed by
its use in Hebrews 11.17, where Isaac
is called Abraham'$ monogenes
but certainly Isaac was not the only son
Abraham had begotten, for he had also begotten Ishmael: The term there
means rather that Isaac was Abraham'$ "unique" sOn, that there was none
other like him. (The word elsewhere means
unique
with no idea of
begetting in view; in the
XX in Psalms 21[22].20; 34[35].17; Wisdom 7.22;
Clement 25.2
Thus the NIV translates John 3.16, "he
his one and
only Son;-
and the NA SB margin reads
O1, unique; only one of His kind
The
noticing
gave
The RSV translates,
he gave his only Son.
All of these versions have rightly
omitted any idea of "begetting
from the translation:
It is reassuring-
however; [0 see that even
though the early church had
misunderstanding of one biblical word_
the rest of Scripture came to the
defense of doctrinal purity and prevented the church from falling into the
error of Arianism (although the struggle consumed most of the fourth century
A.D.)
If the phrases "begotten of the Father before all worlds" and "begotten, not
made'
were not in the Nicene Creed, the phrase would only be of historical
interest [O US nOW; and there would be no need to talk of any doctrine of the
eternal begetting of the Son.
But since the phrase remains in
creed that is
still commonly used_
perpetuate the unfortunate necessity of having
explain tO every new
generation of Christians that "begotten of the Father"
has nothing t0 do with any other English sense of the word beget: It would
seem more helpful if the language of
eternal begetting of the Son" (also
called the
eternal generation of the Son'
were not retained in any modern
theological
formulations. Similarly; tO refer to Jesus as God's "only begotten'
Son
anguage that derives from the King James translation
seems
t0 be
more confusing than helpful. What is needed is simply that we insist on
eternal
personal differences in the relationship between Father; Son, and Holy
Spirit; and that the Son eterally relates
the Father as
son does t0 his
father:
(The fact that Jesus
said t0 be "bom of God" in
John 5.18
probably not
reference tO an eteral relationship, but rather refers to the incarnation when
Christ was born as
man; compare Acts 13.33; Hebrews 1.5.)
Finally; in previous discussions of what this
eterna_
begetting" might have
meant; it has been suggested that the Father has eternally been in some sense
the source of the distinctions in role among the Father; Son, and
Spirit
(e.g-, Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology_
93-94). So
as we do not
assume that these personaE
distinctions had
beginning at some point in time
nothing in Scripture would seem
contradict this idea; but nothing in
Scripture would indicate that we should affirm it, either: Perhaps there is no
meaningful sense in which we should speak about any one of the persons
being
source"
of these personal distinctions
have always existed
and are essential to the nature of God himself:
