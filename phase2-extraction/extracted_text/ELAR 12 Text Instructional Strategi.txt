ELAR 12 Text Instructional Strategies
Teaching Literary Response Writing Skills Literary response skills are the foundation for engaging with literature. They allow students to react and respond in various ways, from summarizing the plot to analyzing a character's motivations or creating an inspired piece of writing. One crucial aspect of working with these skills is using evidence from the text itself. This evidence becomes the building block for
supporting an analysis of a literary text
supporting reflection on the purpose of a literary text
composing creative responses to literature
composing aesthetically compelling responses to literature, engaging the reader rather than merely delivering information
By mastering these skills, students unlock the deeper meaning and beauty hidden within literature. By mastering these skills, students unlock the deeper meaning and beauty hidden within literature.
Components of a Strong Literary Response Thesis Statement: A clear, focused, and debatable thesis statement acts as a roadmap for the entire response. Think of it as a compass that points students toward their analysis. Thesis Statement: A clear, focused, and debatable thesis statement acts as a roadmap for the entire response. Think of it as a compass that points students toward their analysis.
Example: In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Brutus' internal conflict between loyalty and justice ultimately leads to his tragic downfall. Example: In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Brutus' internal conflict between loyalty and justice ultimately leads to his tragic downfall.
Textual Evidence: Empower students to become detectives of the text. Instruct them on how to identify relevant quotes, passages, or literary devices that serve as evidence to support their claims.

Example: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas's initial description of his seemingly perfect community as "Sameness" foreshadows the dystopian reality he will soon discover. Example: In The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas's initial description of his seemingly perfect community as "Sameness" foreshadows the dystopian reality he will soon discover.
Analysis: Students need to unpack the meaning and significance of the evidence they've chosen. How does it connect to their argument? What deeper meaning does it reveal about the text? Encourage them to move from summarizing the text to analyzing its layers. Analysis: Students need to unpack the meaning and significance of the evidence they've chosen.

Example: In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gatsby's extravagant parties serve not only to celebrate but also to mask his inner loneliness and yearning for the past.
Organization: A well-organized response is a clear response. Equip students with a framework for structuring their analysis, such as an introduction with a thesis statement, body paragraphs focusing on specific points with textual evidence and analysis, and a conclusion summarizing their main ideas.

Differentiation in Reading Instruction Differentiation in reading requires a strong understanding of students' academic abilities. Consider the following individual aspects of student learning when planning for differentiation:
Background knowledge - What gaps could prevent the student from mastering a skill? Background knowledge - What gaps could prevent the student from mastering a skill?
Pacing - Does the student require additional instructional time to master a skill? Pacing - Does the student require additional instructional time to master a skill?
Complexity - Can the skill or content be broken down into simpler components? Can it be extended into more complex concepts? Complexity - Can the skill or content be broken down into simpler components? Can it be extended into more complex concepts?
Scaffolding - How does this content relate to the skills and content that have come before and will come after? Scaffolding - How does this content relate to the skills and content that have come before and will come after?
Specific methods of differentiation depend on the lesson content and student population, but teachers can adapt the following strategies for all groups of students:
Different texts depending on skill level and student interest
For example, young students with little prior literary exposure will benefit from the use of big books, which teachers can use to guide their attention to various print concepts and elements of text structure. For example, young students with little prior literary exposure will benefit from the use of big books, which teachers can use to guide their attention to various print concepts and elements of text structure.
Variation in length and difficulty of independent practice
For example, students who have limited prior literary exposure will need lower-level books with repetitive text and illustrations to explore during independent practice.

Teaching Literary Analysis Literary analysis and reading comprehension are related but distinct skills. Comprehension focuses on understanding the basic meaning of a text--what happened and who was involved. Literary analysis goes deeper, asking students to interpret symbols, evaluate author choices, and connect elements to themes.

Effective reading instruction involves improving both comprehension and analytical skills. Teaching literary analysis requires direct instruction of higher-order thinking, textual evidence, and interpretation skills.
Common elements of literary analysis include:
Theme - The central message or insight about life or human nature
Characterization - How characters are developed through actions, dialogue, and description
Setting - Time and place, and how it influences mood or meaning
Figurative Language - Devices like simile, metaphor, personification
Point of View - Who's telling the story and how it shapes perspective
Symbolism and Motif - Recurring elements that represent deeper meanings
Tone - The author's attitude about the topic
Mood - The emotional atmosphere
Pre-Reading Activities Pre-reading activities for literary analysis help students build the context, curiosity, and purpose needed to interpret a text deeply. Pre-reading activities for literary analysis help students build the context, curiosity, and purpose needed to interpret a text deeply.
Effective pre-reading strategies for literary analysis include:

Teachers can support literary analysis with pre-reading tools, such as:
Anticipation guides
Theme-driven quick-writes
KWL charts focused on literary concepts
Visual maps exploring genre expectations
These tools and activities set the stage for deeper analysis, helping students enter the text with awareness of authorial choices and a clear focus on meaning.

Annotation Strategy
Example
Symbol system
Circling figurative language, exclamation points for characterization
Color coding with pens or highlighters
Pink for setting details, green for theme
Short margin notes
Tracking insights on tone, theme, or character development
Other classroom activities that support close reading and literary analysis include double-entry journals, responding to quotes, small-group reading with guided discussion questions, and think-aloud modeling by the teacher. Like annotation, these strategies encourage students to slow down, read closely, make their thinking visible, and consider how literary elements contribute to the effects and themes of the text.

Like annotation, these strategies encourage students to slow down, read closely, make their thinking visible, and consider how literary elements contribute to the effects and themes of the text.
Post-Reading Activities Post-reading is where analysis takes shape. After engaging with the text, students need structured opportunities to examine how meaning is built. Most often, students will critically analyze the author's choices on impact, theme, and meaning of the text. Students should also write personal reflections on elements such as character or theme. Additionally, some standards require students to provide comparative responses across texts. Post-reading is where analysis takes shape.

Teaching Argumentative Text Analysis Unlike informative texts, argumentative texts are written to convince an audience to agree with the central claims. Authors consider their purpose and audience to make the most persuasive appeals, choose the most relevant evidence, and select the most resonant and compelling language. By mastering these concepts, students will become more adept at dissecting and evaluating the arguments they encounter in academic and everyday contexts.

The Rhetorical Situation Before analyzing an argumentative text, students need to analyze its rhetorical situation. The rhetorical situation determines a speaker's strategic choices about style, word choices, and evidence. Before analyzing an argumentative text, students need to analyze its rhetorical situation. The rhetorical situation determines a speaker's strategic choices about style, word choices, and evidence.
Acronyms like SPACE can be helpful tools to break down the rhetorical situation. Acronyms like SPACE can be helpful tools to break down the rhetorical situation.
Speaker: Who wrote this, and what do we know about them? Speaker: Who wrote this, and what do we know about them?
Purpose: What does the speaker want their audience to do or believe after engaging with the text? Purpose: What does the speaker want their audience to do or believe after engaging with the text?
Audience: Who received this text, and what do we know about them? Audience: Who received this text, and what do we know about them?
Context: What was happening in the world when this text was published? Context: What was happening in the world when this text was published?
Exigence: What motivated the speaker to write this argument when they did? Exigence: What motivated the speaker to write this argument when they did?
The rhetorical situation impacts all of the speaker's choices in their argument. For example, an author trying to convince non-pet owners to buy a dog will use different tactics than if they were addressing current dog owners. Likewise, a wedding toast calls for different language choices than a business meeting. The rhetorical situation impacts all of the speaker's choices in their argument.

Likewise, a wedding toast calls for different language choices than a business meeting.
Analyzing Rhetorical Choices Persuasive Appeals
Understanding the rhetorical situation is crucial as it guides the author's persuasive appeals throughout the text. For instance, an author might begin by appealing to logic and conclude with an emotional appeal. To help students identify new appeals, teachers should help them find shifts in tone (empathy to motivation or anger to hope) which are created with word choice. After finding each appeal and the textual evidence that supports it, students should analyze why the speaker chose those appeals based on the rhetorical situation.

Ethos - an appeal to the speaker's character or credibility
Pathos - an appeal to the audience's emotions
Logos - an appeal to the argument's logic
Kairos - an appeal to the timeliness or context of the argument
Rhetorical Devices
The author of an argumentative text will also use persuasive techniques, known as rhetorical devices, to emphasize their claims. For example, the author might make a hyperbolic statement, draw a parallel, ask a rhetorical question, or repeat a keyword or phrase. Explicitly teaching these devices will help students identify them in argumentative texts. Once they find the devices, they can determine why the speaker chose those devices based on the rhetorical situation.

Logical Fallacies
Students should look for logical fallacies in an argumentative text or moments where an argument seems convincing, but the logic is flawed. Identifying fallacies and how they could be improved will support students' argumentation skills.

Claims and Counterclaims It's important for students to learn how to break down an argumentative text's structure:
Central claim
Sub-claims
Counterargument(s)
An argumentative text is likely to provide a central claim and several sub-claims. Authors support these claims with evidence such as statistics, researched facts, anecdotes, and the author's reasoning. An argumentative text is likely to provide a central claim and several sub-claims. Authors support these claims with evidence such as statistics, researched facts, anecdotes, and the author's reasoning.
It is also likely that the author will anticipate some of the audience's possible objections and address them directly through counterclaims. Students should assess how well the author addresses the counterpoints and whether or not the evidence or argument provided to discredit these points is factual, logical, and reasonable.

Evaluation of Differing Perspectives When presenting a new theme or topic, allowing students to view the subject from multiple perspectives can be an effective instructional choice. Comparison builds critical thinking skills and gives a more holistic and nuanced picture of the issue. This is especially important when covering politically charged or sensitive topics. Teachers should help students draw their own conclusions based on evidence rather than teaching one perspective or opinion. To achieve this goal, teachers should always ensure that they provide resources that come from opposing viewpoints or even just present a variety of voices and views on a topic.

To achieve this goal, teachers should always ensure that they provide resources that come from opposing viewpoints or even just present a variety of voices and views on a topic.
See the list below of key strategies teachers can use to help students evaluate differing perspectives:
Provide a variety of texts from a diverse range of authors
Featuring a range of voices will develop students' critical thinking skills as they explore why each author might hold a particular viewpoint. Featuring a range of voices will develop students' critical thinking skills as they explore why each author might hold a particular viewpoint.
This strategy can show students that history is not simply one narrative but a variety of human experiences that engender various perspectives. This strategy can show students that history is not simply one narrative but a variety of human experiences that engender various perspectives.
Diverse texts also serve as mirrors and windows for students, who may see themselves in a particular text or find compassion for another. Diverse texts also serve as mirrors and windows for students, who may see themselves in a particular text or find compassion for another.
Provide texts from different time periods along with historical context
This strategy will allow students to identify how historical context influences perspective and compare and contrast with their contemporary ideas. This strategy will allow students to identify how historical context influences perspective and compare and contrast with their contemporary ideas.
When students understand historical context, they can better determine the validity of an argument or viewpoint. When students understand historical context, they can better determine the validity of an argument or viewpoint.
Provide a graphic organizer to help students determine the perspective of the text they are analyzing
Including a graphic organizer can help students identify critical questions they should ask themselves when looking at various texts. Including a graphic organizer can help students identify critical questions they should ask themselves when looking at various texts.
Make sure students have an opportunity to synthesize what they've learned and express their own opinions on the topic or theme
Encouraging students to formulate their own ideas and beliefs in the classroom, even when presented with differing perspectives, is an integral part of establishing a safe learning community and freethinking individuals. Encouraging students to formulate their own ideas and beliefs in the classroom, even when presented with differing perspectives, is an integral part of establishing a safe learning community and freethinking individuals.
For example, when studying the topic of Civil Disobedience, a teacher might present the following documents to illustrate differing perspectives:
Patrick Henry's "Speech to the Virginia Convention" (1775)
Judith Sargent Murray's "On the Equality of Sexes" (1790)
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave (1845)
Henry David Thoreau's essay on "Civil Disobedience" (1849)
MLK's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963)
This list shows a variety of viewpoints on and motivations for using civil disobedience. Students could analyze the context for each text and each author's perspective. This would provide a much broader view of the value of Civil Disobedience than they might get from reading a textbook that simply lists historical movements. Then, they could consider contemporary examples of Civil Disobedience and, ultimately, form their own opinions on the topic.
