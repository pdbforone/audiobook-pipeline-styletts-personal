LIFE OF PHILOPOEMEN -- XTTS MASTER TEXT chapters the first through the ninth chapter the first
In the city of Mantinea there was a citizen named Kleander, of an ancient and distinguished family and of great influence. Yet, though noble, he was so unfortunate as to be driven from his native city and forced to take refuge in Megalopolis. He was attracted thither chiefly by Kraugis, the father of Philopoemen, a man eminent in all respects, and his especial friend. While Kraugis lived, Kleander lacked nothing; and after his friend's death, he strove to repay the kindness he had received by devoting himself to the education of the orphan boy, even as Homer tells us that Achilles was nurtured by the exile Phoinix.

The child, full from the first of a noble and commanding spirit, grew under his care into a youth of great promise. When he drew near to manhood, two citizens of Megalopolis, Ekdemus and Megalophanes, undertook the further charge of his education. These men had studied in the Academy under Arkesilaus, and were remarkable above all others for bringing the lessons of philosophy to bear upon public affairs. They freed their own country by secretly slaying the despot Aristodemus. They expelled the despot Nikokles from Sikyon with the help of Aratus. And when the people of Kyrene, torn by factions, begged their aid, they went thither and restored order and respect for the laws.

Yet they themselves regarded their greatest achievement to be the education of Philopoemen; for, by training him in the principles of true philosophy, they made him a benefactor to all Greece. And indeed Greece loved him greatly, as the last great man born of her old age, after so many illustrious sons of former times. A Roman once called him "the last of the Greeks, " as though he believed that Greece had never after him produced a son worthy of herself.

chapter the second
His appearance was not repulsive, as some suppose; for the statue of him at Delphi shows no deformity. The mistake of his Megarian hostess seems to have arisen from his simplicity and good nature. When she heard that the commander-in-chief of the Achaeans was coming to her house, she was in great turmoil preparing dinner, her husband being away. Philopoemen entered, wearing a coarse cloak. She, thinking him a servant sent before his master, ordered him to help her with the work. He immediately threw off his cloak and began to split firewood.

While he was thus employed the master of the house returned, and seeing him, exclaimed, "What is this that you are doing, Philopoemen? " And Philopoemen answered in the Doric dialect, "I am paying the penalty of my ugly face. "
Titus also once jested upon his figure, saying, "Philopoemen, you have fine hands and legs, but no belly, " for indeed he had a remarkably small waist. Yet the jest hinted more at his poverty than at his shape; for although he had plenty of excellent infantry and cavalry, he was often in great distress for money to pay them.

chapter the third
His desire for distinction was not unmixed with rivalry and passion. He longed to emulate the fame of Epameinondas; and though he imitated that great man in energy, sagacity, and contempt of riches, yet he could not in political contests preserve the calm and gentle temper of his model. His fiery nature often betrayed him into sallies more befitting a soldier than a statesman. His desire for distinction was not unmixed with rivalry and passion.

His fiery nature often betrayed him into sallies more befitting a soldier than a statesman.
Indeed, from his childhood he loved war, and eagerly practised all warlike exercises, especially fighting in complete armour and riding on horseback. He became an excellent wrestler, and was invited to take part in contests; but when he asked whether such training might not impair his usefulness as a soldier, and learned that the body of an athlete, pampered and delicately cared for, differs in all respects from that of a warrior, he not only abstained from wrestling but ridiculed it, and when in command he strove to bring all athletic exercises into contempt as enervating the bodies of the best men for the most important struggles.

When he left his teachers, he joined his fellow-citizens in a raid into Laconia for plunder. In these expeditions he was always first in the attack and last in the retreat. In time of peace he strengthened his body by hunting and by labouring upon his farm. When he left his teachers, he joined his fellow-citizens in a raid into Laconia for plunder.

He owned a fine estate about twenty furlongs from the city. After his morning or evening meal he would walk to it, sleep there on whatever bed was at hand like a common labourer, rise early, help the vine-dressers and herdsmen with their work, and then return to the city for public business. Whatever he gained from spoils in these raids he spent upon horses, arms, and the ransoming of captives; while he increased his income only by the careful cultivation of his land, believing that the justest and most honourable way of acquiring wealth was to avoid all temptation to wrong others.

He listened to philosophical discourse and read treatises, though only such as taught virtue. He delighted especially in those passages of Homer that stir courage, and he studied Evangelus's treatise on tactics, and the histories of Alexander the Great. But he held reading to be useless unless it led to action. When studying tactics he paid little heed to diagrams, but examined the ground itself: the slopes, the broken places, the streams and ravines, and the effect they would have upon a line of battle. On his walks he considered these matters and exercised the minds of his companions by questioning them; for he devoted his whole soul to the art of war, deeming those who were not soldiers to be useless members of the community.

chapter the fifth
When he was about thirty years old, Kleomenes, king of the Lacedaemonians, made a night attack upon Megalopolis, forced the guard on the wall, and reached the marketplace. Philopoemen hastened to the rescue and fought with great spirit, though unable to dislodge the enemy. Yet he gained time for the citizens to escape, bearing the whole weight of Kleomenes's attack until he himself, wounded and thrown from his horse, could scarcely escape.

The Megalopolitans fled to Messene. Kleomenes then offered to restore their city and lands to them, but Philopoemen persuaded them not to accept the offer; for, he said, Kleomenes did not intend to restore the city, but wished to gain possession of the citizens as well, in order to hold it more securely. He would not remain there guarding empty houses; he wished to entrap the inhabitants. By these arguments Philopoemen withheld his countrymen from surrender; yet the refusal gave Kleomenes a pretext for destroying much of the city and carrying off great spoil.

chapter the sixth
When King Antigonus afterwards joined the Achaeans against Kleomenes, they found the enemy advantageously posted near Sellasia. Philopoemen was among the cavalry. Next to him were the Illyrians, who were ordered to remain in reserve until the signal of a red flag was raised by Antigonus.

Next to him were the Illyrians, who were ordered to remain in reserve until the signal of a red flag was raised by Antigonus.
The allied generals imprudently attacked with the Illyrians, and Eukleides, brother of Kleomenes, perceiving that the foot were now separated from the horse, sent his swift light troops to outflank them. The Illyrians, thrown into disorder, began to give way. Philopoemen saw that the cavalry could charge the exposed light troops with great effect, and suggested this to the Macedonian officers; but they scorned the advice, for he had not yet reputation enough to warrant such bold counsel.

He therefore gathered his own countrymen and charged alone. At the first onset he threw the enemy's skirmishers into confusion and routed them with great slaughter. Wishing to animate the allies and press the fugitives, he dismounted and pursued on foot across rough, broken ground full of watercourses and rocks. While forcing his way over these obstacles he was struck through both thighs by a javelin with a thong attached. The wound was not mortal, yet the javelin pierced completely through and held his legs bound together like a fetter, while the thong made it difficult to draw it out.

As his friends hesitated, the battle raging ever more fiercely excited him to act. He strained one leg forward and the other back until he broke the shaft in the middle; then the two pieces were drawn out. Thus freed, he snatched up his sword, ran among the combatants, and fought with such ardour that he fired all his men with emulation.

After the victory, Antigonus asked the Macedonians why they had charged without orders. They replied that they had been compelled by a young citizen of Megalopolis. Antigonus smiled and said, "That young man acted the part of a veteran commander. "

Philopoemen gained great renown by this exploit. Antigonus eagerly sought his service and offered him high command and pay; but Philopoemen excused himself, knowing his temper would not endure subordination under another.

He could not remain idle, so he sailed to Crete to gain experience. Living among a sober and warlike people, he acquired still greater fame. On returning to the Achaeans he was at once appointed commander of the cavalry. He could not remain idle, so he sailed to Crete to gain experience.

He found the knights using any horses they could find, and often serving by substitutes. They lacked discipline and courage, and their commanders overlooked this because the knights held great influence in the League. Philopoemen would not suffer such abuses. He went from city to city, appealing to the honour of the young, punishing the recalcitrant, and instituting rigorous exercises and public contests. Soon he produced an admirable body of cavalry, quick in movement, skilful in wheeling, and able to act as one man.

In a great battle on the river Larissa against the Eleans and Aetolians, Damophantus, commander of the Elean horse, rushed upon him. Philopoemen met his charge and thrust him from the saddle with his spear. The Eleans instantly fled, and Philopoemen won great glory as both brave soldier and skilful commander.

chapter the eighth
The Achaean League had first been organized by Aratus, who gathered its scattered cities into a noble Greek commonwealth. As stones in a stream accumulate into a firm mass, so the Achaeans, by aiding neighbouring cities and freeing them from tyrants, gradually incorporated many into a single Peloponnesian body.

While Aratus lived, they relied much on Macedonian kings. But when Philopoemen rose to command, they had already gained confidence in their own strength and ceased to court foreign powers. Aratus, as no soldier, accomplished most of his work by diplomacy and friendship with princes. Philopoemen, brave, vigorous, and eminently successful from the outset, raised both the spirit and the strength of the League, making the Achaeans confident of victory whenever he led them.

chapter the ninth
His first task was to reform the Achaean military equipment. They used light shields too narrow to cover the body, and spears much shorter than the Macedonian pike. Thus they were good skirmishers but weak in close combat. Their order was loose and easily broken. His first task was to reform the Achaean military equipment.

Their order was loose and easily broken.
Philopoemen pointed this out and persuaded them to adopt the heavy shield and long pike, to wear the full armour of helmet, corslet, and greaves, and to fight in a firm, unbroken phalanx. When they assumed complete armour he raised their spirits by telling them they would become irresistible.

When they assumed complete armour he raised their spirits by telling them they would become irresistible.
He also reformed their way of life. He could not entirely root out their passion for purple robes, rich carpets, and luxurious banquets; but he diverted this desire for splendour into their military equipment. Their plate was melted to gild cuirasses, shields, and horse trappings. The public places were filled with youths training chargers and exercising with arms, while the women fitted plumes to helmets and adorned buff coats and cloaks. He also reformed their way of life.

This sight roused courage and eagerness for battle. For in war, splendour increases valour, as Homer tells us of Achilles, stirred to action when his shining armour was brought to him.

The youth trained incessantly in their new manoeuvres, delighted with the close and solid formation, and soon could move with ease in heavy armour, priding themselves on its beauty and longing to prove its worth.

At this time the Achaeans were at war with Machanidas, despot of Lacedaemon, a man of great resources who threatened all Peloponnesus. When he invaded Arcadia and reached Mantinea, Philopoemen marched swiftly to meet him.

When he invaded Arcadia and reached Mantinea, Philopoemen marched swiftly to meet him.
Both armies drew up near Mantinea with many mercenaries. Machanidas began by routing the Achaean light troops, but instead of attacking the phalanx, he pursued too eagerly. Philopoemen, seeing the enemy infantry left unprotected, marched straight upon them, ignoring those Lacedaemonians who pursued his auxiliaries.

Philopoemen, seeing the enemy infantry left unprotected, marched straight upon them, ignoring those Lacedaemonians who pursued his auxiliaries.
He took the main body in flank, found them without cavalry or general, imagining victory already theirs; he broke them and slew about four thousand. Then he turned to face Machanidas returning with his mercenaries. A deep watercourse lay between them. The despot sought to leap it, while Philopoemen endeavoured to bar his passage.

At last Machanidas drove his fiery horse at the chasm. The horse gained the farther brink with its forefeet and struggled upward when Simias and Polyaenus, comrades of Philopoemen, rode forward with levelled lances. But Philopoemen himself reached Machanidas first. Seeing the horse's head raised to cover its master, he turned slightly aside, grasped his lance in both hands, and drove it through the tyrant's body, casting him down.

It is in this posture that Philopoemen is represented in the statue at Delphi, set there by the Achaeans in admiration of his courage and conduct on that day.

chapter the tenth
After this great victory, Philopoemen's fame was spread throughout all Greece, and many who had formerly looked with contempt upon the Achaeans were now eager to court their alliance. For Machanidas, whom he had slain with his own hand, had been a terror to Peloponnesus, a man restless, violent, and possessed of immense resources; yet Philopoemen had not only overthrown his army, but had himself struck down the despot in single combat, in sight of both armies.

When the Achaeans returned home, they decreed that the statue at Delphi should be set up in his honour, representing him as he had appeared at the moment when he pierced Machanidas; and they resolved also to keep a solemn festival each year in commemoration of the victory. The cities received him with great rejoicing; the young men admired him, and the old trusted him; for they believed that in him they had found not only a brave general but a truly wise counsellor, one who would never employ success for private ends, nor seek to raise himself above the laws, but who would use his power for the good of the whole League.

Yet Philopoemen himself, though not insensible to praise, bore his good fortune with a noble modesty. He sought no relaxation, but returned at once to the training of the Achaean youth, reminding them that victory belonged not to chance or fortune, but to labour, discipline, and constant practice. He endeavoured to persuade the cities to maintain their armour bright, their horses well-bred and exercised, and their bodies hardened by toil; for he used to say that a people who admired fine armour only in their temples, and not in their fields of battle, were like men who prized the instruments of music but cared nothing for the art of using them.

He also strove to repress the rising arrogance which sometimes attends success. By gentle words, and sometimes by sharp rebuke, he warned the younger men that they must not exult over the fallen enemy, nor behave with insolence toward those who had borne the burden of war before them. For, he said, victory is a fleeting goddess who quickly turns her face from the proud; but steadfast courage, joined with moderation, makes a city both feared by her enemies and beloved by her allies.

Thus Philopoemen, though flushed with triumph, remained in all things the same sober and steadfast man; and Greece looked upon him as upon a general whom it was equally safe to trust in victory or defeat.

eleven. It is said that when the Greeks were assembled at the Nemean Games, Philopoemen, who had been elected commander-in-chief for the second time, and not long before had won his victory at Mantinea, being at leisure during the festival displayed his phalanx to the Greeks, with the troops drawn up in their serried array, and manœuvring with quickness and precision. Afterwards, while the musicians were contending for the prize in the theatre he entered it accompanied by his young soldiers in their military cloaks and purple uniform, all of them strong men in the prime of life, showing a modest respect for their general, combined with a martial bearing due to their many brave feats of arms. Just as they came into the theatre Pylades the musician began to recite the Persians of Timotheus
"He wrought for Greece a noble work of freedom"

twelve. But just as horses like their accustomed rider, and if another mounts them are scared and unmanageable, so the power of the Achæans became feeble under any other general than Philopoemen. When they saw him, the whole army rejoiced, and were filled with cheerful confidence, well knowing that he was the only one of their generals before whom the enemy always fled, terrified by his name, as, indeed, appeared by their acts. For Philip king of Macedon, thinking that if Philopoemen were put out of the way, the Achæans would become subject to himself as they were before, sent men privately to Argos to assassinate him: but his plot was disclosed, and he became an object of universal hatred to the Greeks. The Boeotians too, when they were besieging Megara and were expecting shortly to take it, retreated in such hot haste that they actually left their scaling ladders planted against the walls, in consequence of a rumour, which proved a false one, that Philopoemen was coming to raise the siege and was close at hand. When Nabis, who became despot over the Lacedæmonians after Machanidas, by a sudden attack captured the town of Messene, Philopoemen was not holding any office, but was a mere private citizen. He could not prevail upon Lysippus, who was commander-in-chief of the Achæans, to go to assist the Messenians, because the latter said that the city must be lost if the enemy were inside the walls. Hereupon Philopoemen went himself to the rescue with the men of his own city, who did not delay for any formal vote to empower him to do so, but followed him because he was born to command. When Nabis heard of his approach he would not await his coming, but although he was in possession of the city he marched out by the opposite gate with all speed, thinking that he would be fortunate if he reached home safe, as indeed he did. Thus was Messene delivered. twelve.

thirteen. All these exploits of Philopoemen are without doubt glorious to him; but he was much blamed for going a second time to Crete at the request of the people of Gortyna, to act as their general, leaving his own country to be attacked by Nabis, because he avoided the war at home to gather unseasonable laurels abroad. Indeed, the citizens of Megalopolis were so hard pressed at that period as to be forced to live entirely within their walls, and grow corn in the very streets, as they were quite cut off from their fields by the enemy, who was encamped before the gates. Philopoemen, by his remaining beyond seas at this time acting as general for the Cretans, gave his enemies an opportunity of charging him with dishonourably shirking the war at home. Some, however, said that since the Achæans had chosen other men generals, Philopoemen, who had no office to fill, had a right to use his leisure in acting as general to the people of Gortyna when they begged him to do so. Indeed, his nature abhorred rest, and he desired his courage and generalship to be in constant action, like everything else belonging to him. This is clearly shown by his saying about king Ptolemy. When some one praised that prince for carefully training his army and exercising himself under arms every day, Philopoemen answered, "Who can admire a king of Ptolemy's age who is still practising and not performing. " However, the citizens of Megalopolis were much vexed by his conduct, which they considered to be that of a traitor, and would have banished him had they not been restrained by the whole body of the Achæans. They sent the general Aristænetus to Megalopolis, who, although he was politically opposed to Philopoemen, would not allow sentence of banishment to be passed against him. After this Philopoemen, being treated with neglect and indifference by his fellow-citizens, induced many of the outlying villages to rebel against the city, telling them to say that they were not originally made subject to it, and he himself openly took their part against his own city when the matter was referred to the general council of the Achæan league. But these things happened afterwards. At the time of which we speak he carried on war in Crete with the Gortynians, not in a simple straightforward manner, as one would expect a Peloponnesian, and especially an Arcadian would do, but he adopted the Cretan character, and by using all their subtle devices and ambushes against themselves, proved that such contrivances are but child's play when tried against a truly experienced general. thirteen.

fourteen. Returning to Peloponnesus with a great reputation from his Cretan successes, he found Philip beaten by Titus Quintius, and Nabis at war both with the Romans and the Achæans. He was at once elected general to attack Nabis, and in a sea fight suffered the same misfortune as Epameinondas, that is to say, he effected much less at sea than was expected of a man of his courage and reputation. fourteen.

Indeed some writers tell us that Epameinondas was unwilling that his countrymen should taste the advantages of the sea, and fearing that, as Plato says, they might from steady soldiers be transformed into licentious wandering sailors, purposely returned from the coast of Asia Minor and the islands without having effected anything.

Philopoemen, imagining that his knowledge of war on land would enable him to fight equally well at sea, learned by experience how greatly practice assists men's courage, and how much their strength is increased by being trained to use it. Not only was he worsted in a sea-fight through inexperience, but having selected an old ship, which had once been a famous vessel, but now was forty years old, she leaked so much as to endanger the lives of those on board. After the action, finding that the enemy despised him, as though his ships had been entirely driven from the sea, and that they were ostentatiously besieging Gythium, he sailed straightway thither and found them quite unprepared, and with their discipline relaxed in consequence of their victory. He landed his men at night, burned the enemy's tents, and slew many of them. A few days afterwards, being surprised by Nabis in a mountainous spot, while all the Achæans gave themselves up for lost, despairing of extricating themselves from such a difficult position, Philopoemen, after a short survey of the country, proved that strategy is the greatest of military qualities. He quietly and steadily changed his front, manœuvred his army out of its disadvantageous position, attacked the enemy, and completely routed them. Perceiving that the fugitives did not make for the city, but scattered themselves all over the country, which was hilly and wooded, full of torrents and precipices, and impassable for cavalry, he made no pursuit, but encamped before dark. As he conjectured that the enemy after their rout would straggle back into the city by twos and threes under cover of the darkness, he concealed many of the Achæans, armed with daggers, in the rough ground near the city. By this stratagem Nabis's force suffered great losses, for as they did not retreat in a body, but each man as best he could, they fell into their foemen's hands at the city gate like birds into a snare.

fifteen. Philopoemen gained so much glory by these exploits, and was so much honoured by the Greeks wherever he appeared in public, that he roused the jealousy of Flamininus, who thought that he, a consul of Rome, was worthier of respect than a mere Arcadian, while he had moreover done much more for Greece, having by one proclamation restored those liberties of which Philip and his Macedonians had deprived it. fifteen.

Flamininus put an end to the war with Nabis, who was shortly afterwards assassinated by the Ætolians. As this event threw Sparta into disorder, Philopoemen seized the opportunity, marched thither with an army, and partly by persuasion, partly by force, prevailed upon the city to join the Achæan league. This wonderfully raised his fame throughout Greece, that he should have won over so famous and powerful a city, for Sparta formed a most important member of the league. He also gained the good will of the Lacedæmonian nobles, who hoped that he would protect their newly-won liberty. They sold the house and property of Nabis, and decreed that the money, amounting to a hundred and twenty talents, should be presented to him by a deputation. On this occasion Philopoemen showed himself to be a man of real virtue. Flamininus put an end to the war with Nabis, who was shortly afterwards assassinated by the Ætolians.

At the interview none of the Spartans liked to propose to him to receive the money, but they excused themselves, and made his own especial friend Timolaus undertake to do this. Timolaus, however, when he reached Megalopolis, and living in the house of Philopoemen had an opportunity of observing the noble simplicity of his character and his lofty integrity, in the familiar intercourse of private life, dared not mention the bribe, but gave some other excuse for his visit and returned home. He was sent a second time, with the same result. On a third visit he with great hesitation broached the subject. Philopoemen listened to him without anger, and sent him back to the Spartans with the advice that they should not corrupt their friends, whose services they could obtain gratis, but keep their money to bribe those who endeavoured to countermine their city in the public assembly of the Achæan league, as, if muzzled in this way, they would cease to oppose them. It was better, he added, to restrain the freedom of speech of their enemies than that of their friends. So uncorrupt was he, and inaccessible to bribes.

sixteen. When Diophanes, the commander-in-chief of the Achæans, endeavoured to punish the Lacedæmonians for a change in their policy, and they by their resistance threw the whole of Peloponnesus into confusion, Philopoemen tried to act as mediator, and to soothe the anger of Diophanes, pointing out to him that at a time when the Romans and king Antiochus with enormous forces were about to make Greece their battle ground, a general ought to direct all his thoughts to their movements, and to avoid any internal disturbance, willingly accepting any apologies from those who did wrong. But as Diophanes took no notice of him, but together with Flamininus invaded Laconia, Philopoemen, disregarding the exact letter of the law, performed a most spirited and noble action. He hurried to Sparta, and, though only a private man, shut its gates in the faces of the commander-in-chief of the Achæans and of the Roman consul, put an end to the revolutionary movement there, and prevailed upon the city to rejoin the Achæan league. Some time afterwards however, we are told by Polybius that Philopoemen, when commander-in-chief, having some quarrel with the Lacedæmonians, restored the exiles to the city, and put to death eighty, or, according to Aristokrates, three hundred and fifty Spartans. He also pulled down the walls of Sparta, and annexed a large portion of its territory to Megalopolis, while he forced all those persons who had been created citizens of Sparta under the rule of the despots to leave the city and proceed to Achæa, except three hundred. These, because they refused to obey him and leave Lacedæmon he sold for slaves, and with the money, as a wanton insult, built a public portico in Megalopolis. Moreover, in his wrath against the Lacedæmonians, he did them a most cruel wrong, for he abolished the Lycurgean system of education and forced them to educate their children like those of the Achæans, because he saw that they never would be humble-minded as long as they lived under the discipline of Lycurgus. Thus was the haughty city of Sparta brought so low by its misfortunes as to permit Philopoemen to cut, as it were, its very sinews, and render it tame and crushed. Afterwards, however, the citizens obtained permission from Rome to retire from the Achæan confederation, upon which they restored their original constitution as far as their great disasters permitted. sixteen.

seventeen. When the Romans were fighting king Antiochus in Greece, Philopoemen was in a private station, but, seeing Antiochus lying idly at Chalkis, wasting his time in unseasonable courtships and weddings, while his Syrian troops, in great disorder and without officers to control them, were scattered through the various Greek cities, living in riotous debauchery, he was vexed at not being elected commander in chief, and said that he envied the Romans their victory. "I, " said he, "if I had been in command, would have cut off the whole of Antiochus's army in the taverns. "
After the defeat of Antiochus the Romans began to tighten their hold upon Greece, and to absorb the Achæan league. Many of the popular leaders took their side, and the growing power of Rome was fated by the divine blessing before long to become absolute in Greece.

Philopoemen, like a skilful pilot, struggling against a rough sea, was often compelled to yield and give way for a time, yet as he was utterly opposed to the Romans he did his best to induce the most influential men to defend the liberties of Greece. Aristænetus of Megapolis, a man of great influence with the Achæans, who urged them in the public assembly not to oppose or to thwart the Romans in anything, was listened to by Philopoemen for some time in silence, until at length he was moved to exclaim, "My good sir, why be in such a hurry to behold the end of Greece? " When Manius the Roman consul had conquered Antiochus, he begged the Achæans to permit the Lacedæmonian exiles to return. Titus Flamininus seconded this request, but Philopoemen opposed it; not because he had any quarrel with the exiles, but because he wished their restoration to be effected by himself and the Achæans, of their own free will, not as a favour to Flamininus and the Romans. Afterwards, when commander-in-chief, he himself restored them. Thus did his high spirit make him impatient of control and authority.

eighteen. When he was in his seventieth year, and eighth term of office as commander-in-chief, he might reasonably expect to finish not only his year of office, but also the rest of his life in peace; for just as in human bodies as their strength wastes away the violence of their diseases abates, so in the Greek states as their power failed their quarrels gradually ceased. However some Nemesis overtook him, as it does a too successful athlete just at the termination of his course. It is said that when some persons in society were praising a man who was thought to be a good general, Philopoemen said, "How can you think that man worth consideration, who was taken by his enemy alive. "
A few days after this Deinokrates of Messene, a personal enemy of Philopoemen, and one who was generally disliked because of his wicked and licentious life, caused Messene to revolt from the Achæan league, and was announced to be marching upon a village named Kolonis. A few days after this Deinokrates of Messene, a personal enemy of Philopoemen, and one who was generally disliked because of his wicked and licentious life, caused Messene to revolt from the Achæan league, and was announced to be marching upon a village named Kolonis.
Philopoemen was at this time lying ill with a fever in the city of Argos, but on hearing this he proceeded at once to Megalopolis, a distance of four hundred furlongs, in one day. From that city he set out straightway with a body of cavalry, composed of the noblest citizens, but mostly very young men, who were proud to serve as volunteers under Philopoemen. They rode into the Messenian territory, met Deinokrates near the hill of Evander, and put him to flight.

They rode into the Messenian territory, met Deinokrates near the hill of Evander, and put him to flight.
However as the Messenian frontier patrol of five hundred men suddenly came up, the defeated body rallied again, and Philopoemen, fearing to be surrounded, and wishing to be careful of the lives of his men, retired into mountainous ground, himself protecting the rear, making frequent charges, and drawing the whole attack of the enemy upon himself. They did not dare to encounter him personally, but clamoured and wheeled about at a distance. In his eagerness to save each one of his young soldiers he ventured forward so often, to cover their retreat, that at last he found himself alone in the midst of his enemies. None of them dared to meet him, but pelted him with stones and darts from a distance, so that he was with difficulty able to guide his horse over the rocky and precipitous ground, and fatigued the animal greatly.

His age was no hindrance to him, because of his habit of constant exercise, but unluckily he was weak from his sickness, and wearied by his long journey, so as to feel faint. His horse at length stumbling threw him to the ground. He fell heavily on his head, and lay speechless for some time, so that his enemies thought that he was dead, and began to turn over his body and strip it. But when he raised his head and opened his eyes they fell upon him in a body, tied his hands behind his back, and led him away, jeering much at a man who never even dreamed that he could have been so triumphed over by Deinokrates.

nineteen. The Messenians who were in the city, greatly excited at the news, assembled at the gates. When they saw Philopoemen dragged along and treated in a manner so unworthy of a man who had gained such glorious victories, most of them felt compassion for him, and were moved to tears as they reflected how uncertain a thing is human power. Thus gradually they expressed aloud their kindly feeling towards him, saying that his former benefits and the liberty which he bestowed upon them by driving out the despot Nabis, ought to be had in remembrance. There were some few, however, who in order to gain favour with Deinokrates, advised him to put Philopoemen to death by torture, pointing out that he was a dangerous enemy, and would be peculiarly exasperated against Deinokrates if he now were to regain his freedom after having been his captive and having been insulted by him. Finally they put him into what was called the Treasury, a subterranean chamber with no window or communication with the outward air, and no door even, but closed by a great stone. There they left him, putting the great stone over the entrance, and placing a guard of armed men round it. nineteen.

Meanwhile the Achæan horsemen rallied from their flight, and as Philopoemen was nowhere to be seen, they thought that he must have fallen. They remained for a long while, searching for him, and reproaching themselves with having obtained dishonourable safety by abandoning to the enemy their leader, who had laid down his life for them. Afterwards they pushed forward, inquiring everywhere for him, and at length learned that he had been captured. They at once sent the news to the various cities of the Achæan league, who took the matter greatly to heart, determined to demand Philopoemen publicly from the Messenians, and prepared for a campaign on his behalf.

twenty. While they were acting thus, Deinokrates feared that delay might save Philopoemen's life. Wishing therefore to be beforehand with the Achæans, as soon as night came on, and the greater part of the Messenians had retired, he opened the prison and sent into it a public slave with a draught of poison, ordering him to stand by Philopoemen until he had drunk it. Philopoemen was lying down wrapped in his cloak, not asleep, but full of trouble and distress of mind. When he saw the light and the slave with the poison standing beside him, he, with great difficulty on account of his weakness, raised himself into a sitting posture. He then took the cup into his hand, and inquired whether he knew anything about the knights, especially about one Lykortas. When the slave answered that most of them had escaped, he nodded his head, looked kindly upon him, and answered, "You tell me good news, if we are not all unfortunate. " He uttered no other word, but drank the poison and laid down again. In his weak condition he was unable to offer any resistance to the operations of the drug, and died immediately. twenty.

twenty-one. When the Achæan cities heard of his death, they went into a general mourning for him. The men of military age assembled at Megalopolis without delay, chose Lykortas as their leader, invaded the Messenian territory, and ravaged it until the Messenians came to their senses and made terms with the Achæans. Deinokrates escaped his merited fate by suicide, as did those who had advised that Philopoemen should be put to death, while those who had advised that he should be tortured were themselves reserved for a death of torture by Lykortas. twenty-one.

They burned his body and collected the ashes into an urn, not carelessly, but mingling a sort of triumphal pomp with his funeral procession. There one might see men crowned with garlands but weeping at the same time, and leading along his enemies in chains. The urn itself, which was scarcely to be seen for the garlands and ribbons with which it was covered, was carried by Polybius, the son of the Achæan commander-in-chief, accompanied by the noblest of the Achæans. The soldiers followed in complete armour, with caparisoned horses, not cast down, but yet too sad to feel any pride in their victory. As they passed through the towns and villages on their way the inhabitants came out as if to welcome him on his return from a successful campaign, laid their hands on his urn, and joined in the procession to Megalopolis. When here the old men, women, and children joined them, a wail of distress ran through the whole army for the unhappy, the unhappy city which was mourning for its hero, and which thought itself to have lost, by his death, the first place in Greece. He was buried with great honour, as we may well believe, and round his tomb the Messenian captives were stoned to death. Many statues were made of him, and many honours voted to him by the Greek cities, which afterwards during that unfortunate time for Greece when Corinth was destroyed, a Roman proposed to destroy, accusing Philopoemen, as if he had been yet alive, of being always an enemy to the Romans. But after Polybius had answered this contemptible fellow, neither the consul Mummius nor his lieutenants would suffer him to deface and take away the honours done in memory of so famous and worthy a man, although he had frequently offered great opposition both to Flamininus and to Manius. They distinguished properly between honour and expediency, rightly thinking that men should reward those who benefit them, but that the brave should always be honoured by all brave men. Thus much have I to tell about Philopoemen. They burned his body and collected the ashes into an urn, not carelessly, but mingling a sort of triumphal pomp with his funeral procession. There one might see men crowned with garlands but weeping at the same time, and leading along his enemies in chains. The urn itself, which was scarcely to be seen for the garlands and ribbons with which it was covered, was carried by Polybius, the son of the Achæan commander-in-chief, accompanied by the noblest of the Achæans. The soldiers followed in complete armour, with caparisoned horses, not cast down, but yet too sad to feel any pride in their victory. As they passed through the towns and villages on their way the inhabitants came out as if to welcome him on his return from a successful campaign, laid their hands on his urn, and joined in the procession to Megalopolis.
