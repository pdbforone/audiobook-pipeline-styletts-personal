Administrating Texas Mandated Assessments
Texas takes the standard assessment tests very seriously. Each campus will have training on the proper way to administer and proctor examinations. It is very important to follow the rules and guidelines. Texas takes the standard assessment tests very seriously. Each campus will have training on the proper way to administer and proctor examinations. It is very important to follow the rules and guidelines.
In general, during assessment tests, the teacher:
cannot have materials out that might help a student
cannot influence a student's answer choice
This includes clarifying what a question is asking and telling a student to bubble in answers that are left blank. This includes clarifying what a question is asking and telling a student to bubble in answers that are left blank.

Effective Learning Environment for Readers and Writers
An effective ELA learning environment should balance direct instruction with time for practicing skills during class. Just as teachers focus on reading practice to support reading fluency, students must spend enough time writing to develop writing fluency. Quality reading and writing instruction are connected, so best practices for motivating students to read and write will overlap in multiple areas.

Motivating Student Readers and Writers
Reserve class time for the practice of reading and writing
Provide exposure to all genres
Write and read for varied purposes
Write for varying, interesting, and (when possible) real audiences
Connect the reading experience with the writing experience by using mentor texts
Set individualized goals and monitor progress
Provide opportunities for students to select their own reading material
Provide journals for students to record their thoughts about self-selected topics
Incorporate collaborative opportunities
Approach reading as a process by incorporating pre-reading, during-reading, and post-reading strategies, including the importance and uses of rereading sections of a text
Approach writing as a process by incorporating pre-writing, revision strategies, and collaborative elements
Teachers should strive to make reading and writing tasks relevant and meaningful to students and provide opportunities for student choice as often as possible.

Enhancing Student Engagement Through Interaction
In addition to the strategies mentioned above, fostering frequent interaction with text and peers is crucial for motivating students and sustaining their engagement in literacy tasks. Here's how:
Independent Interaction - Dedicate time for students to engage with texts independently using strategies including annotation, summarization, and graphic organizers. These strategies allow them to explore their interests, develop comprehension skills, and formulate their own interpretations.

Collaborative Interaction - Provide opportunities for students to discuss texts with peers. This can involve activities like literature circles, partner reading, or group projects. Collaborative interaction allows students to share ideas, build social connections, and learn from each other's perspectives. These discussions can enhance critical thinking skills, clarify understanding, and generate enthusiasm for the learning process.

Technology Integration - While the core focus should remain on student-to-student and student-to-text interaction, some technology-based resources can facilitate and enhance these interactions. For example, online discussion forums allow students to share their thoughts and interpretations of a text beyond the classroom walls. Annotation tools can allow students to collaboratively highlight and comment on digital texts, fostering deeper engagement with the material.

Example Activity: Literature Circles
Literature circles are a powerful tool for promoting collaborative interaction. In a literature circle, small groups of students choose a common text to read and then meet regularly to discuss the text in depth. Students take on different roles within the group, such as discussion leader, vocabulary expert, or passage summarizer. This format encourages active participation, critical thinking, and peer-to-peer learning, which fosters a more engaging and motivating reading experience.

Motivational Theory
Student motivation refers to students' desire to participate. Highly motivated students tend to participate more in class, learn more, and positively impact the classroom atmosphere. Unmotivated students tend to disengage, struggle to pay attention, and negatively affect the classroom atmosphere. The teacher's role is to motivate students who are not intrinsically motivated and continue to encourage those who are intrinsically motivated.

Unmotivated students tend to disengage, struggle to pay attention, and negatively affect the classroom atmosphere. The teacher's role is to motivate students who are not intrinsically motivated and continue to encourage those who are intrinsically motivated.
Intrinsically motivated students draw their motivation from the learning process. They find joy in the activity itself and learn for the sake of learning. This is the most desired motivation for students because these students continue the learning process outside the classroom and without any incentive given by the teacher.

Students who lack intrinsic or internal motivation may need to be externally motivated. Extrinsic motivation (or external motivation) means that the motive for the activity comes from sources outside the individual. Finding the best external motivation for different students can be difficult. External rewards can decrease intrinsic motivation.

Other factors influencing student motivation are a student's sense of autonomy, relatedness to the classroom, and competence in the topic. Other factors influencing student motivation are a student's sense of autonomy, relatedness to the classroom, and competence in the topic.
Autonomy is the ability to govern oneself. A successful classroom will give students a sense of autonomy; while they may be unable to decide what they do every minute of every day, some self-governed time should be present in lessons and units. This becomes more important during middle and high school. Autonomy is the ability to govern oneself.

Students who have a sense of relatedness feel valued in their environment. When they enjoy their environment and feel they belong and are wanted, they are intrinsically motivated to perform well. Creating connections with your students and a safe, welcoming environment will help improve relatedness and student motivation.

Competence refers to how a student perceives their own understanding and mastery of a topic. Students who have a higher perceived competence will want to demonstrate this mastery. They may volunteer answers more frequently or participate in discussions. Students with lower competence or who feel the topic is beyond their mastery may shut down or refuse to participate because they feel they cannot master the content. Allowing students to display mastery in various ways and praising students for demonstrating knowledge in any way they can will encourage student participation and motivation.

Culture of High Expectations
Students tend to meet the expectations set for them. Consequently, if a teacher has low expectations for students, their performance will reflect that; if they have high expectations, they will rise to the occasion.

It is the classroom teacher's responsibility to create a high-expectations culture. Students should be encouraged to set high learning goals for themselves. The teachers' role is to provide the help and resources students need to meet these goals. Teachers should tell their students they have the skills and support needed to succeed. When students struggle to meet the high expectations set for them, teachers should have a conversation, or student-teacher conference, to determine the issue and make a plan to help the student get back on track.

The teacher can incentivize the class and individuals to meet certain expectations. This lets students know what the teacher thinks they can do and creates a positive atmosphere of encouragement for students to meet expectations.

This lets students know what the teacher thinks they can do and creates a positive atmosphere of encouragement for students to meet expectations.
Students can be involved in establishing class norms of high expectations. Once students have spent some time in school, they know what a well-run classroom is like and can identify what is expected of them. Giving them the autonomy to discuss and make some decisions as a class will reinforce expectations and encourage self-monitoring. Some classes even create and sign class contracts to keep the expectations posted and clear and hold all accountable for following them.

Positive Class Community
The ideal classroom feels like a community. It's a positive place where learners collaborate and grow together. Ultimately, it's somewhere both students and teachers want to be.

Building relationships is a great way to promote a positive class community. Teachers should take an interest in their students' lives and help them get to know each other.

Icebreaker games and activities help create meaningful connections. Taking time for class check-ins or meetings throughout the school year can help these relationships continue to build. The teacher can also greet students daily and provide time for them to greet one another. Teachers can write positive notes or letters of encouragement to students and set up a system for them to do the same for each other. Attending student games, concerts, or other school-sponsored extracurricular activities is another option for fostering relationships that will translate to positive classroom communities.

Teacher Attitude
A positive teacher promotes a positive classroom. Teachers should have positive attitudes toward their students and their instruction. A positive teacher promotes a positive classroom. Teachers should have positive attitudes toward their students and their instruction.
Teachers can show positivity by communicating confidence in students' abilities and showing they will support them throughout their time together. Teachers should also be mindful of diversity in the classroom and examine how their beliefs or biases (even unconscious biases) affect students. Though unconscious beliefs are a natural part of human cognition, being aware of what those beliefs are will lead to growth. Teachers should strive to create a learning atmosphere in which all students feel welcomed and are able to communicate their needs and concerns.

Teachers should strive to create a learning atmosphere in which all students feel welcomed and are able to communicate their needs and concerns.
Further, teachers need to be aware of how their beliefs may impact their classroom behavior. If a teacher were to develop negative views about a student's family based on their socioeconomic status, political stance, or cultural identity, this could impact their treatment of the student or family members in a way that damages relationships. For example, if a low-income student's parents are challenging to reach or consistently skip parent-teacher conferences, assuming they do not value their child's education would be harmful. Significant unavoidable circumstances (such as long work hours or a lack of transportation or childcare) may exist. Teachers should approach every interaction with an open mind and be aware of personal biases that could harm their classroom culture.

When students have a positive relationship with their teacher, they feel more comfortable asking questions and taking risks in the classroom. They are also more likely to view their teacher as a trusted adult, who they can turn to when help is needed.

Promoting Inclusivity
It's easy for students to feel excluded by their peers. Effective strategies teachers can use to help prevent feelings of isolation include the following:
Modeling positive social interactions and desired behaviors for students
Using social stories to teach students about expected social behavior in various settings
Carefully teaching expectations regarding inclusivity
Explicitly teaching problem-solving strategies that students can use when issues arise
Conducting team-building activities to help students get to know each other
Providing opportunities for cooperative or group learning, making sure to
Clarify expectations
Assign roles so students know what to do. Assign roles so students know what to do.
Active Engagement
Showing enthusiasm in instruction is an excellent step in promoting students' active engagement in their learning. Engagement refers to the level of interest and attention students demonstrate while learning.

Classroom Management
One of the most important responsibilities of an educator is to create a safe, supportive, and orderly learning environment that values all student populations. This means explicitly teaching behavior expectations and involving students in setting those routines. The results, including increased independence and reduced anxiety, benefit all students but may be especially important for students with exceptionalities.

Providing support for transitions and establishing routines in the classroom offers several benefits, including the following:
More efficient use of instructional time
Diminished anxiety
Increased student independence
Improved behavior
Healthier classroom culture
Enhanced classroom environment where students feel secure, engaged, and ready to participate
Special education populations often require additional support during transitions to meet their unique learning needs, their sensitivity to changes, the individualized nature of their education plans, and any social and emotional considerations, and to address the necessity for collaboration among educators and support professionals.

Interdisciplinary Connections
Students must learn to read, write, speak, listen, and use language effectively in various content areas, so it's very often the case that the literacy skills and concepts of ELA are incorporated into math, science, social studies, and other disciplines. Like ELA, these classes require the ability to understand a text, decipher the meaning of new vocabulary words, construct sound arguments, and communicate effectively. Such interdisciplinary connections require strong academic and domain-specific vocabulary instruction to assist students as they navigate literacy and ELA skills in other subject areas.

In addition to bringing ELA concepts into other content-area classrooms, ELA teachers can help support content-area teachers by teaching topics or themes that align with lessons in other disciplines. By analyzing, reading, and writing about different topics, students can apply the knowledge gained in one discipline to another discipline as a way to deepen the learning experience.

Interdisciplinary study allows students to combine multiple disciplines and pursue different ways of thinking about the same problem. When successfully done, it helps to develop important transferable skills, such as critical thinking, communication, and analysis, which are important and applicable to future learning experiences.

Managing Student Behavior
Managing student behavior is an essential skill set for teachers to have in their repertoire. If classroom behavior is not managed, it creates obstacles to learning. Students need to know how to behave in the classroom, toward the teacher, and each other. A teacher's best bet is to take a proactive approach by trying to prevent problem behaviors from occurring in the first place. To take a proactive approach to behavior management, teachers can:
Establish clear expectations from the very beginning
Seek student input about class behavior expectations to develop their sense of ownership and responsibility
Establish incentives and consequences
implement them consistently
If minor incidents do occur, try to address them immediately. Sometimes, a simple non-verbal reminder will do the trick. The less class time interrupted, the better.

Reinforcement and Punishment
Once expectations have been set, reinforcement (encouraging a behavior to happen again) and punishment (discouraging a behavior) can be used to shape behavior. Reinforcement can be used continuously (every time the behavior occurs) or intermittently (at a random or fixed time). Once expectations have been set, reinforcement (encouraging a behavior to happen again) and punishment (discouraging a behavior) can be used to shape behavior. Reinforcement can be used continuously (every time the behavior occurs) or intermittently (at a random or fixed time).
The term "punish" or "punishment" is unlikely to be the correct choice for scenario-based questions about behavior management. However, it's still important to understand the definition and distinction of reinforcement. The term "punish" or "punishment" is unlikely to be the correct choice for scenario-based questions about behavior management. However, it's still important to understand the definition and distinction of reinforcement.
There are four types:
Positive Reinforcement: presenting a stimulus in reaction to a behavior to increase the likelihood of that behavior
For example, a student answers a question, and the teacher compliments him. For example, a student answers a question, and the teacher compliments him.
The teacher compliments the students to increase the likelihood that they will participate in class in the future. The teacher compliments the students to increase the likelihood that they will participate in class in the future.
Negative Reinforcement: removing a stimulus in reaction to a behavior to increase the likelihood of a behavior
For example, the teacher allows students to talk to each other if they all earn "A"s on a quiz. The teacher removes a stimulus (class-wide silence) in response to a behavior to increase the likelihood of the behavior. For example, the teacher allows students to talk to each other if they all earn "A"s on a quiz. The teacher removes a stimulus (class-wide silence) in response to a behavior to increase the likelihood of the behavior.
Typically, negative reinforcement would remove a positive punishment already in place. A teacher should not begin a class with a negative stimulus. Typically, negative reinforcement would remove a positive punishment already in place. A teacher should not begin a class with a negative stimulus.
Positive Punishment: presenting a stimulus in reaction to a behavior to decrease the likelihood of the behavior
For example, a student passes a note during class, and the teacher writes the student a detention slip. For example, a student passes a note during class, and the teacher writes the student a detention slip.
The teacher is presenting a stimulus (the detention) to decrease the likelihood of the student passing notes in the future. The teacher is presenting a stimulus (the detention) to decrease the likelihood of the student passing notes in the future.
Negative Punishment: removing a stimulus in reaction to a behavior to decrease the likelihood of the behavior
For example, if a student is caught playing non-instructional games on the school computer, the teacher may remove the privilege of working on the school computer for the duration of the class period. For example, if a student is caught playing non-instructional games on the school computer, the teacher may remove the privilege of working on the school computer for the duration of the class period.

Extra Behavior Support
When students need extra support following behavior expectations in the classroom, there are strategies teachers can use to help:
Student/Teacher Conferences
identify the root of the issue
make a plan for finding a solution
Behavior Contracts
agreement between the student and teacher
covers the behavioral goal and steps toward reaching it
Conferences and contracts are great strategies for helping students with disruptive behavior; however, if the behavior is dangerous, these would not be reasonable solutions. All students must be protected.

Communicating Assessment Results
There will be instances throughout the school year when it is necessary to share assessment data with stakeholders. Stakeholders may include administrators, colleagues, community members, family members, and of course the students themselves. It is important for all stakeholders to have a clear understanding of the context, methods, and results of the assessment data. This means stakeholders should know specifically:
what was assessed
why it was assessed
how it was assessed
what the performance of the assessment indicates
All stakeholders should have assessment data communicated to them in clearly understandable language. All stakeholders should have assessment data communicated to them in clearly understandable language.
Consider the audience when providing feedback. For students, this will mean making an effort to balance negative feedback with positive feedback. Discussion with students should aim to support, encourage, and motivate them. This typically means intentionally including positive feedback along with the discussion of opportunities for growth.

Proper measures should be taken to assure that assessment results are clearly communicated to ELL students and families. Appropriate linguistic supports, whether translation or visual aids (such as graphs or charts), should be used to make input about assessment results comprehensible. Language should not be a barrier to ELL populations understanding their levels of performance in the classroom.
