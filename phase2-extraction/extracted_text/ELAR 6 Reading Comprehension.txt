Summarizing teach students to summarize the content. Students should be able to pull together important information from the text and put it into their own words by paraphrasing. Teachers should scaffold summarizing skills to focus students on including only the main points rather than in depth details. Prompts to help students focus on the key points can be provided. For example, students could be provided with the following framework to generate a summary somebody wanted but so then. Summarizing teach students to summarize the content.

Drawing conclusions and making inferences not everything students need to understand about a text is directly stated. That's why students need to draw conclusions and make inferences to fully comprehend the text. Conclusions are drawn, and inferences are made when readers use background knowledge plus clues in the text to form an idea. For example, when students are asked to determine how a character feels in a story, teachers can prompt them to think about what they know about how people show their emotions, plus how the character acted to make their inference.

Writing to support reading. Writing to support reading.
Connecting writing assignments to reading instruction is more than just an opportunity for students to demonstrate understanding or comprehension of a text. These activities are also a tool for students to clarify and increase their own thinking about a text. This is often referred to as writing to understand or writing to learn.

Some ways that students can use writing to support their reading comprehension include journaling readers take time to capture their thoughts and reactions to reading, making connections to texts. Reader response journals can be a combination of informal student writing and teacher directed prompts and or activities. Annotations this is both a note taking and metacognitive strategy that occurs in the margins of a text. Annotating is metacognitive because it forces the reader to consider the section they have just read, evaluating their general comprehension, while also determining its meaning and importance to the piece as a whole. Outlining by outlining a text, readers will not only determine the main idea and supporting details of the text but will also analyze the text's organization. Written response whether or not it is intended for the purpose of assessment, written response requires students to reflect on their reading. This process often takes the student back into the text to reread and clarify understanding. Graphic organizers these tools are useful in helping students understand text structure and key components of the text. They can also be used as resources to guide students' own future writing assignments.

Assessing reading comprehension. Assessing reading comprehension.
Reading comprehension assessment should occur during and after reading a text. Specific assessments will vary depending on the students' grade or reading level and the assessed comprehension skill. Remember, reading comprehension encompasses a wide variety of skills and levels. Some activities used to assess reading comprehension include the following retelling or drawing a picture of what happened. Responding to guided questions during reading or after reading. Identifying key elements of the text, such as the main idea. Writing an analysis essay on an assigned text. Completing projects that require the analysis of the text's theme or other elements.

Criterion and norm referenced tests are both used to evaluate reading comprehension. Criterion and norm referenced tests are both used to evaluate reading comprehension.
Criterion referenced tests measure a student's performance against a specific set of learning standards or criteria, not against other students. In reading comprehension, these tests can determine whether a student has mastered particular comprehension skills, such as identifying the main idea, making inferences, or understanding vocabulary in context. Teachers can use the results from criterion referenced comprehension assessments to identify specific skills and concepts to focus on during whole class, small group, or individual instruction.

Norm referenced tests compare a student's performance to that of a norm group, typically containing students of the same age or grade level. The goal is to see how an individual performs relative to peers. With reading comprehension, these tests are often used for diagnostic or placement purposes. Teachers can use results from norm referenced comprehension assessments to create reading groups, share student progress with families, and identify students needing additional support or enrichment.

Standardized reading assessments. Standardized reading assessments.
Throughout their K to twelve education, students will take several standardized reading tests issued by their state of residence. If a teacher has access to their students' scores, they should consider the following test date make sure the data is up to date. Even if the test was administered recently, teachers should gather new data to reflect current student performance. Skill breakdown review which specific skills were assessed (comprehension, vocabulary, fluency) and analyze performance in each area rather than only overall scores. Score interpretation understand the scoring method (criterion referenced, norm referenced, grade equivalent). Misinterpreting scores could lead to inaccurate conclusions. Demographic and contextual factors consider factors like English language learner (E L L) status, special education needs, and socioeconomic background that might influence test performance.

Comprehension issues can stem from a variety of factors. Determining the reason behind the issue will dictate what kind of differentiation is needed. Ensure that a student's comprehension issues are not related to fluency because fluency challenges often have a significant impact on comprehension and need to be addressed as well. It is likely that a student will need specific intervention in both fluency and comprehension. Comprehension issues can stem from a variety of factors.

Some comprehension issues are related to background knowledge. It is difficult for students to make sense of text without a basic understanding of what it is about. In other words, it's difficult to build on knowledge that is not there. The experiences that students have in their schema are vastly different depending on their cultural, linguistic, and family background. Teachers should not assume students have the background knowledge needed to comprehend the text. Teachers should help build background knowledge before students read and teach students strategies for independently developing their schema when approaching a new text.

Differentiated instruction to support comprehension can be incorporated into reading instruction in various ways, with some that can be done independently and some with direct teacher support. Some examples include graphic organizers story maps are useful tools for fiction narratives, while other organizers can be specifically selected to fit structures of different informative texts. Sentence stems can also be provided as a guide for response. Think alouds either with the teacher or with a partner, stopping periodically to comment on the text encourages metacognition. With this strategy, students' understanding can be evaluated and corrected while they are reading instead of waiting until the end of a text. Students can also use a modified version of this activity independently by writing in the margin at pre selected points. Text options it can be beneficial to provide students texts on their reading level, when possible, to ensure that the learning objective isn't negatively affected by comprehension issues. Teacher readings of grade level texts if a student is reading below grade level, the teacher can read the text aloud and discuss it with them to support their understanding. Audiobooks students can listen while they read an audio version of the text. This frees them to focus on comprehension skills when fluency related issues are still a factor.

In some situations, the above strategies can be further differentiated by scaffolding with text specific questions. For example, in a traditional think aloud, the student would volunteer a thought on their own. If a student is struggling with comprehension, the teacher could provide questions for the student to answer aloud at specific points in the text. This provides an opportunity to support student comprehension by drawing their attention to important story elements.

The ability of a student to successfully select books for independent reading requires teacher guidance and training. Students generally need to select books on their independent reading level. Access to leveled books in the classroom can support this need. As students become more advanced readers and more independent in their book selections, a leveled book system becomes less crucial, but students should still be taught how to select books that fit their reading skills.

There are three equally important parts of text complexity. One measure alone is not adequate to clearly understand the complexity of the texts. While quantitative measures are very useful, they cannot (at least at present) capture all of the elements that make a text easy or challenging to read. Quantitative measures along with professional judgment are important tools for ensuring that text complexity matches the needs of students and specific learning objectives and tasks.

Why listening matters. Why listening matters.
Listening comprehension and reading comprehension share many cognitive processes. When students actively listen, they develop phonemic awareness by hearing sounds manipulated in spoken language, students strengthen their ability to identify and decode sounds within words, a key component of reading fluency. Expand vocabulary exposure to new words spoken aloud helps students recognize them in text, enriching their understanding. Build background knowledge schema listening to informational texts provides context and understanding for future reading encounters, especially for complex topics. Practice comprehension strategies active listening hones essential skills readily applied to reading, such as identifying main ideas, making inferences, and following sequences.

Many academic vocabulary words, like analyze, describe, and reflect, are essential and relevant across all content areas. Other academic vocabulary is more subject specific and referred to as domain specific vocabulary. Teachers can preview upcoming content to determine what words are important to understanding the new concepts and are best suited to be used as targeted vocabulary words.

Teachers can preview upcoming content to determine what words are important to understanding the new concepts and are best suited to be used as targeted vocabulary words.
The frequency with which a word will be encountered (also known as its utility) can also determine its usefulness as a vocabulary word. If the word is encountered regularly, students are more likely to retain its meaning because they will have frequent opportunities to interact with it.

Students who have a larger vocabulary will be able to recognize words more quickly and read more fluently. This vocabulary helps students comprehend what they read and apply background knowledge and schema to a text. Strong readers use their knowledge of vocabulary, academic terms, jargon, and background knowledge to create meaning in a text. To successfully comprehend a text, a student must combine the contextual meaning of the text with their background knowledge and experiences to determine its meaning and purpose.

Building upon schema and background knowledge makes it easier for students to connect new learning to established knowledge. Let's say a class is reading about tornadoes. One student already knows the academic terms tornado, air pressure, and funnel cloud. This student is at an advantage while reading because they do not need to learn these concepts or any new information presented. By coming to the text with appropriate background knowledge, they can focus on the main ideas and think more critically about the content.
