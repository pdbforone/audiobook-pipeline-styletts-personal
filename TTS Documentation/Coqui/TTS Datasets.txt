Some of the known public datasets that we successfully applied 🐸TTS:

English - LJ Speech

The LJ Speech Dataset
This is a public domain speech dataset consisting of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books. A transcription is provided for each clip. Clips vary in length from 1 to 10 seconds and have a total length of approximately 24 hours.

The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain. The audio was recorded in 2016-17 by the LibriVox project and is also in the public domain.

The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to conclude that five shots may have been fired,

Many animals of even complex structure which live parasitically within others are wholly devoid of an alimentary cavity.

File Format
Metadata is provided in transcripts.csv. This file consists of one record per line, delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
Normalized Transcription: transcription with numbers, ordinals, and monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).
Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of 22050 Hz.

Statistics
Total Clips	13,100
Total Words	225,715
Total Characters	1,308,678
Total Duration	23:55:17
Mean Clip Duration	6.57 sec
Min Clip Duration	1.11 sec
Max Clip Duration	10.10 sec
Mean Words per Clip	17.23
Distinct Words	13,821
Miscellaneous
The audio clips range in length from approximately 1 second to 10 seconds. They were segmented automatically based on silences in the recording. Clip boundaries generally align with sentence or clause boundaries, but not always.
The text was matched to the audio manually, and a QA pass was done to ensure that the text accurately matched the words spoken in the audio.
The original LibriVox recordings were distributed as 128 kbps MP3 files. As a result, they may contain artifacts introduced by the MP3 encoding.
The following abbreviations appear in the text. They may be expanded as follows:
Abbreviation	Expansion
Mr.	Mister
Mrs.	Misess (*)
Dr.	Doctor
No.	Number
St.	Saint
Co.	Company
Jr.	Junior
Maj.	Major
Gen.	General
Drs.	Doctors
Rev.	Reverend
Lt.	Lieutenant
Hon.	Honorable
Sgt.	Sergeant
Capt.	Captain
Esq.	Esquire
Ltd.	Limited
Col.	Colonel
Ft.	Fort
(*) there's no standard expansion for "Mrs."

19 of the transcriptions contain non-ASCII characters (for example, LJ016-0257 contains "raison d'être").

The World English Bible
A large, single-speaker speech dataset in English

About Dataset
Context
The World English Bible is a public domain update of the American Standard Version of 1901 into modern English. Its audio recordings are freely available at http://www.audiotreasure.com/. The only problem when you use those in speech-relevant tasks is that each file is too long. That's why I split each audio file such that an audio clip is equivalent to a verse. Subsequently I aligned them to the text.

Content
This dataset is composed of the following:

README.md
wav files sampled at 12,000 KHZ
transcript.txt.

transcript.txt is in a tab-delimited format. The first column is the audio file paths. The second one is the script. Finally, the rightmost column is the duration of the audio file.

Acknowledgements
I would like to show my respect to Dave, the host of www.audiotreasure.com and the reader of the audio files.

About this resource:

LibriTTS is a multi-speaker English corpus of approximately 585 hours of read English speech at 24kHz sampling rate, prepared by Heiga Zen with the assistance of Google Speech and Google Brain team members. The LibriTTS corpus is designed for TTS research. It is derived from the original materials (mp3 audio files from LibriVox and text files from Project Gutenberg) of the LibriSpeech corpus. The main differences from the LibriSpeech corpus are listed below:
The audio files are at 24kHz sampling rate.
The speech is split at sentence breaks.
Both original and normalized texts are included.
Contextual information (e.g., neighbouring sentences) can be extracted.
Utterances with significant background noise are excluded.
For more information, refer to the paper "LibriTTS: A Corpus Derived from LibriSpeech for Text-to-Speech", Heiga Zen, Viet Dang, Rob Clark, Yu Zhang, Ron J. Weiss, Ye Jia, Zhifeng Chen, and Yonghui Wu, arXiv, 2019. If you use the LibriTTS corpus in your work, please cite this paper where it was introduced.
The MD5 checksums of the downloads are as follows (note: not everyone will want to know this).

CSTR's VCTK Corpus (Centre for Speech Technology Voice Cloning Toolkit) includes speech data uttered by 109 native speakers of English with various accents. Each speaker reads out about 400 sentences, most of which were selected from a newspaper plus the Rainbow Passage and an elicitation paragraph intended to identify the speaker's accent. The newspaper texts were taken from The Herald (Glasgow), with permission from Herald & Times Group. Each speaker reads a different set of the newspaper sentences, where each set was selected using a greedy algorithm designed to maximise the contextual and phonetic coverage. The Rainbow Passage and elicitation paragraph are the same for all speakers. This corpus was recorded for the purpose of building HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis systems, especially for speaker-adaptive HMM-based speech synthesis using average voice models trained on multiple speakers and speaker adaptation technologies. The file was previously available on the CSTR website, and was referenced in the Google DeepMind work on WaveNet: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf .

Description
This CSTR VCTK Corpus includes speech data uttered by 110 English speakers with various accents. Each speaker reads out about 400 sentences, which were selected from a newspaper, the rainbow passage and an elicitation paragraph used for the speech accent archive. The newspaper texts were taken from Herald Glasgow, with permission from Herald & Times Group. Each speaker has a different set of the newspaper texts selected based a greedy algorithm that increases the contextual and phonetic coverage. The details of the text selection algorithms are described in the following paper: C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi and S. King, "The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database," https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2013.6709856 The rainbow passage and elicitation paragraph are the same for all speakers. The rainbow passage can be found at International Dialects of English Archive: (http://web.ku.edu/~idea/readings/rainbow.htm). The elicitation paragraph is identical to the one used for the speech accent archive (http://accent.gmu.edu). The details of the the speech accent archive can be found at http://www.ualberta.ca/~aacl2009/PDFs/WeinbergerKunath2009AACL.pdf All speech data was recorded using an identical recording setup: an omni-directional microphone (DPA 4035) and a small diaphragm condenser microphone with very wide bandwidth (Sennheiser MKH 800), 96kHz sampling frequency at 24 bits and in a hemi-anechoic chamber of the University of Edinburgh. (However, two speakers, p280 and p315 had technical issues of the audio recordings using MKH 800). All recordings were converted into 16 bits, were downsampled to 48 kHz, and were manually end-pointed. This corpus was originally aimed for HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis systems, especially for speaker-adaptive HMM-based speech synthesis that uses average voice models trained on multiple speakers and speaker adaptation technologies. This corpus is also suitable for DNN-based multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis systems and neural waveform modeling. The dataset was was referenced in the Google DeepMind work on WaveNet: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf . Please note while text files containing transcripts of the speech are provided for 109 of the 110 recordings, in the '/txt' folder, the 'p315' text was lost due to a hard disk error.]

About Dataset
Kokoro Speech Dataset
Kokoro Speech Dataset is a public domain Japanese speech dataset.
It contains 43,253 short audio clips of a single speaker reading 14 novel books.
The format of the metadata is similar to that of
LJ Speech so that the dataset is compatible
with modern speech synthesis systems.

The texts are from
Aozora Bunko,
which is in the public domain. The audio clips
are from
LibriVox project,
which is also in the public domain.
Readings are estimated by
MeCab
and
UniDic Lite
from kanji-kana mixture text.
Readings are romanized
which are similar to the format used by
Julius.

The audio clips were split and transcripts were aligned automatically by
Voice100.

Sample data
Listen
from your browser or download
randomly sampled 100 clips.

File Format
Metadata is provided in metadata.csv. This file consists of one record per line,
delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
Transcription: Kanji-kana mixture text spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
Reading: Romanized text spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of 22050 Hz.

Statistics
The dataset is provided in different sizes, xlarge, large, small, tiny.
large, small and tiny don't share same clips.
xlarge contains all available clips, including large, small and tiny.

Mean duration: 4.871 secs
Total duration: 00:23:08
How to get the data
Because of its large data size of the dataset, audio files are not
included in this repository, but the metadata is included.

To make .wav files of the dataset, run

$ bash download.sh
to download the metadata from the project page. Then run

$ pip3 install torchaudio
$ python3 extract.py --size tiny
This prints a shell script example to download MP3 audio files
from archive.org and extract them if you haven't done it already.

After doing so, run the command again

$ python3 extract.py --size tiny
to get files for tiny under ./output directory.

You can give another size name to the --size option to get
dataset of the size.
