1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,049
$1.87. That was all. She had put her to side, one cent and then another and then another,

2
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:14,910
in her careful buying of meat and other food. Della counted it three times. $1.87. There

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,289
is little more to say about it. In the hall below was a letter-box, too small to hold

4
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,510
a letter. There was an electric bell, but it could not make a sound. Also there was

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,300
a name beside the door, Mr. James Dillingham Young. But when Mr. James

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,920
Dillingham Young entered the furnished rooms, his name became very short indeed.

7
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,420
Mrs. James Dillingham Young put her arms warmly about him and called him Jim.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,600
You have already met her. She is Della. Della finished her crying and cleaned

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,619
the marks of it from her face. She stood by the window and looked out with no

10
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:57,359
interest. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,619
buy Jim a gift. She had put aside as much as she could for months with this

12
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:07,819
result. $20 a week is not much. Everything had cost more than she had

13
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:13,659
expected. It always happened like that. Only $1.87 to buy a gift for Jim.

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,480
Her. Jim. She had had many happy hours planning something nice for him.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,019
Something nearly good enough. Something almost worth the honor of belonging to Jim.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,599
There was a looking glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have

17
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,659
seen the kind of looking glass that is placed in eight furnished rooms. It

18
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,239
was very narrow. A person could see only a little of himself at a time.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
However, if he was very thin and moved very quickly, he might be able to

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,180
get a good view of himself. Della, being quite thin, had mastered

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,459
this art. Suddenly she turned from the window and stood before the

22
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,019
glass. Her eyes were shining brightly, but her face had lost its color.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,200
Quickly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its complete length.

24
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,560
The James Dillingham Youngs were very proud of two things which they

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
owned. One thing was Jim's gold watch. It had once belonged to his

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,960
father, and long ago it had belonged to his father's father.

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,560
The other thing was Della's hair. If her queen had lived in the

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,539
rooms near theirs, Della would have washed and dried her hair where

29
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:21,379
the queen could see it. Della knew her hair was more beautiful than

30
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,199
any queen's jewels and gifts. If a king had lived in the same

31
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,240
house with all his riches, Jim would have looked at his watch

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,539
every time they met. Jim knew that no king had anything so

33
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,199
valuable. So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her,

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,379
shining like a falling stream of brown water. It reached below

35
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,879
her knee. It almost made itself into a dress for her. And then she

36
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,120
put it up on her head again nervously and quickly. Once she stopped

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,120
for a moment and stood still while a tear or two ran down her face.

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,479
She put on her old brown coat. She put on her old brown hat.

39
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,319
Mrs. Sophrony, large, too white, cold-eyed, looked at her.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,219
Will you buy my hair? asked Della.

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,539
I buy hair, said Mrs. Sophrony. Take your hat off and let

42
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,240
me look at it.

43
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,169
Down fell the brown waterfall.

44
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,490
Twenty dollars, said Mrs. Sophrony, lifting the hair to feel its

45
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,169
weight. Give it to me quick, said Della. Oh, and the next two hours

46
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,169
seemed to fly. She was going from one shop to another to find

47
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:28,349
a gift for Jim. She found it at last. It surely had been made

48
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,969
for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of

49
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,469
the shops, and she had looked in every shop in the city.

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,750
It was a gold watch chain, very simply made. Its value was in its

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,129
rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple, you

52
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,550
knew that it was very valuable. All good things are like this.

53
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,810
It was good enough for the watch. As soon as she saw it, she

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,889
knew that Jim must have it. It was like him. Quietness and

55
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,569
value. Jim and the chain both had quietness and value.

56
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,610
She paid twenty-one dollars for it, and she hurried home

57
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,250
and eighty-seven cents. With that chain on his watch, Jim could

58
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,250
look at his watch and learn the time anywhere he might be.

59
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,870
Though the watch was so fine, it had never had a fine chain.

60
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,790
He sometimes took it out and looked at it only when no one

61
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,490
could see him do it. When Della arrived home, her mind

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,310
quieted a little. She began to think more reasonably.

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,089
She started to try to cover the sad marks of what she had

64
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:32,889
love and large-hearted giving when added together can leave

65
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,540
deep marks. It is never easy to cover these marks, dear friends.

66
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,079
Never easy. Within forty minutes her head looked a little better,

67
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,100
with her short hair she looked wonderfully like a schoolboy.

68
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,920
She stood at the looking-glass for a long time.

69
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,000
If Jim doesn't kill me, she said to herself, before he looks

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,279
at me a second time, he'll say, I look like a girl who

71
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,379
sings and dances for money. But what could I do?

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,779
Oh, what could I—what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven

73
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,420
cents? Jim was never late. Della held the watch chain in her hand

74
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,660
and sat near the door where he always entered. Then she heard

75
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,360
his step in the hall and her face lost color for a moment.

76
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,339
She often said little prayers quietly, about simple

77
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,779
everyday things. And now she said, Please God, make him think.

78
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,800
And now she said, Please God, make him think I'm still pretty.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,319
He needed a new coat, and he had nothing to cover his cold hands.

80
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,540
Jim stopped inside the door. He was as quiet as a hunting dog

81
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,120
when it is near a bird. His eyes looked strangely at Della,

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,439
and there was an expression in them that she could not

83
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,620
understand. It filled her with fear. It was not anger,

84
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,480
nor surprise, nor anything she had been ready for.

85
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,000
He simply looked at her with that strange expression on his

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,339
face. Della went to him.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,180
Jim, dear, she cried, Don't look at me like that.

88
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,399
I had my hair cut off and sold it. I couldn't live through

89
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,379
Christmas without giving you a gift. My hair will grow again.

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,800
You won't care, will you? My hair grows very fast.

91
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,879
It's Christmas, Jim. Let's be happy.

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,040
You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful nice gift I

93
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,620
got for. You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful

94
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,740
nice gift I got for you. He seemed to labor to

95
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,420
understand what had happened. He seemed not to feel

96
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,040
sure he knew.

97
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,899
Cut it off and sold it, said Della.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,500
Don't you like me now?

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,439
I'm me, Jim. I'm the same without my hair.

100
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,259
Jim looked around the room.

101
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,220
You say your hair is gone, he said.

102
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,480
You don't have to look for it, said Della.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,220
It's sold, I tell you. Sold and gone, too.

104
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,120
It's the night before Christmas, boy.

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,879
Be good to me, because I sold it for you.

106
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,920
Maybe the hairs of my head could be counted, she said.

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,720
But no one could ever count my love for you.

108
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,339
Shall we eat dinner, Jim?

109
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,420
Jim put his arms around his Della.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,259
For ten seconds let us look in another direction.

111
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,560
Eight dollars a week, or a million dollars a year.

112
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,180
How different are they?

113
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,050
Someone may give. You an answer, but it will be wrong.

114
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,089
The Magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them.

115
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,389
My meaning will be explained soon.

116
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,709
Someone may give you an answer, but it will be wrong.

117
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,350
He threw it upon the table.

118
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,649
I want you to understand me, Dell, he said.

119
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,829
Nothing like a haircut could make me love you any less.

120
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,769
But if you'll open that, you may know what I felt when I came in.

121
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,029
White fingers pulled off the paper.

122
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,110
And then a cry of joy, and then a change to tears.

123
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,009
For there lay the combs. The combs that Della had seen in a shop window,

124
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,970
and loved for a long time.

125
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:43,610
Beautiful combs, with jewels perfect for her beautiful hair.

126
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,730
She had known they cost too much for her to buy them.

127
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,610
She had looked at them without the least hope of owning them.

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,589
And now they were hers, but her hair was gone. But she held them to her heart,

129
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:56,689
and at last was able to look up and say,

130
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,629
My hair grows so fast, Jim. And then she jumped up and cried,

131
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,769
Oh, oh! Jim had not yet seen his beautiful gift.

132
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,490
She held it out to him in her open hand.

133
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,870
The gold seemed to shine softly as if with her own warm and loving

134
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,730
spirit. Della, said he,

135
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,430
Let's put our Christmas gifts away and keep them awhile.

136
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,149
They're too nice to use now.

137
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,129
I sold the watch to get the money to buy the combs.

138
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,790
And now I think we should have our dinner. The Magi, as you know, were wise men,

139
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,410
wonderfully wise men,

140
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,910
who brought gifts to the newborn Christ child.

141
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,570
They were the first to give Christmas gifts.

142
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,070
Being wise, their gifts were doubtless wise ones.

143
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,990
And here I have told you the story of two children

144
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,350
who were not wise. Each sold the most valuable thing he owned

145
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,450
in order to buy a gift for the other.

146
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:52,070
But let me speak a last word to the wise of these days.

147
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,230
Of all who give gifts, these too were the most wise.

148
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,889
Of all who give and receive gifts, such as,

149
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,769
They are the most wise.

150
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,129
Everywhere they are the wise ones.

151
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,070
They are the Magi.
