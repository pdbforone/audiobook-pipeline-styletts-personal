WEBVTT

00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:07.589
$1.87. That was all. She had put her to side, one cent and then another and then another,

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.850
in her careful buying of meat and other food. Della counted it three times. $1.87. There

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.236
is little more to say about it. In the hall below was a letter-box, too small to hold

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:25.422
a letter. There was an electric bell, but it could not make a sound. Also there was

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:31.237
a name beside the door, Mr. James Dillingham Young. But when Mr. James

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:35.824
Dillingham Young entered the furnished rooms, his name became very short indeed.

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:41.370
Mrs. James Dillingham Young put her arms warmly about him and called him Jim.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.673
You have already met her. She is Della. Della finished her crying and cleaned the

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:51.463
marks of it from her face. She stood by the window and looked out with no

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:57.208
interest. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day and she had only $1.87 with which to

00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:02.394
buy Jim a gift. She had put aside as much as she could for months with this

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:07.660
result. $20 a week is not much. Everything had cost more than she had

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.203
expected. It always happened like that. Only $1.87 to buy a gift for Jim. Her

00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:20.187
Jim. She had had many happy hours planning something nice for him. Something

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:24.914
nearly good enough. Something almost worth the honor of belonging to Jim.

00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:28.345
There was a looking glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:32.374
seen the kind of looking glass that is placed in eight furnished rooms. It

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:37.202
was very narrow. A person could see only a little of himself at a time. However,

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:40.672
if he was very thin and moved very quickly, he might be able to get a good

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:45.180
view of himself. Della, being quite thin, had mastered this art. Suddenly

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.130
she turned from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.236
brightly, but her face had lost its color. Quickly she pulled down her hair and

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:58.705
let it fall to its complete length. The James Dillingham Youngs were very

00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:03.691
proud of two things which they owned. One thing was Jim's gold watch. It

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.880
had once belonged to his father, and long ago it had belonged to his

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.588
father's father. The other thing was Della's hair. If her queen had

00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:16.457
lived in the rooms near theirs, Della would have washed and dried her

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:20.367
hair where the queen could see it. Della knew her hair was more

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:24.436
beautiful than any queen's jewels and gifts. If a king had lived in

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:27.588
the same house with all his riches, Jim would have looked at his

00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:32.176
watch every time they met. Jim knew that no king had anything so

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:36.684
valuable. So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her shining

00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:41.311
like a falling stream of brown water. It reached below her me. It

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.822
almost made itself into a dress for her. And then she put it up

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:47.934
on her head again, nervously and quickly, once she stopped for a

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:51.405
moment and stood still while a tear or two ran down her face. She put

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.035
on her old brown coat. She put on her old brown hat. Mrs.

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:59.184
Sifroni, large, too white, cold-eyed, looked at her.

00:02:59.184 --> 00:03:02.036
"'Will you buy my hair?' asked Della.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:06.904
"'I buy hair,' said Mrs. Sifroni. "'Take your hat off and let me look at it.'

00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:10.045
Down fell the brown waterfall.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:13.556
"'Twenty dollars,' said Mrs. Sifroni, lifting the hair to

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:14.753
feel its weight.

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:20.019
"'Give it to me quick,' said Della. "'Oh, and the next two hours seemed to fly.'

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.168
She was going from one shop to another to find a gift for Jim.

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:28.795
She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:32.147
one else. There was no other like it in any of the shops, and

00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:35.897
she had looked in every shop in the city. It was a gold watch

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:40.285
chain, very simply made. Its value was in its rich and pure

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:44.115
material. Because it was so plain and simple, you knew that it

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:47.785
was very valuable. All good things are like this. It was good

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:52.014
enough for the watch. As soon as she saw it, she knew that Jim

00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:56.721
must have it. It was like him, quietness and value. Jim and the

00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.551
chain both had quietness and value. She paid twenty-one dollars

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.663
for it, and she hurried home with the chain and eighty-seven

00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:06.934
cents. With that chain on his watch, Jim could look at his

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:10.206
watch and learn the time anywhere he might be. Though the

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:14.434
watch was so fine, it had never had a fine chain. He sometimes

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:17.865
took it out and looked at it only when no one could see him do

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:22.333
it. When Della arrived home, her mind quieted a little. She

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.924
began to think more reasonably. She started to try to cover the

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:29.913
sad marks of what she had done. Love and large-hearted

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:34.511
giving, when added together, can leave deep marks. It is

00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:39.139
never easy to cover these marks, dear friends. Never easy. Within

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.330
forty minutes her head looked a little better. With her short

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.602
hair she looked wonderfully like a schoolboy. She stood at the

00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:47.916
looking-glass for a long time.

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:51.346
If Jim doesn't kill me, she said to herself, before he looks at

00:04:51.346 --> 00:04:55.017
me a second time, he'll say, I look like a girl who sings and

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:59.804
dances for money. But what could I do? Oh, what could I—what

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:03.953
could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents? Jim was never

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:07.384
late. Della held the watch chain in her hand and sat near the

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.496
door where he always entered. Then she heard his step in the

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:14.645
hall and her face lost color for a moment. She often said little

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:18.794
prayers quietly, about simple everyday things. And now she

00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:23.182
said, Please God, make him think. And now she said, Please

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:27.012
God, make him think I'm still pretty. He needed a new coat

00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:31.081
and he had nothing to cover his cold hands. Jim stopped inside

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.592
the door. He was as quiet as a hunting dog when it is near a

00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:37.943
bird. His eyes looked strangely at Della, and there was an

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.613
expression in them that she could not understand. It filled her

00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:45.762
with fear. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor anything she

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.634
had been ready for. He simply looked at her with that

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:52.145
strange expression on his face. Della went to him.

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:56.454
Jim, dear, she cried, Don't look at me like that. I had my hair cut

00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:59.167
off and sold it. I couldn't live through Christmas without

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.757
giving you a gift. My hair will grow again. You won't care, will

00:06:02.757 --> 00:06:06.587
you? My hair grows very fast. It's Christmas, Jim. Let's be

00:06:06.587 --> 00:06:10.576
happy. You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful nice

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:14.725
gift I got for. You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:18.316
nice gift I got for you. He seemed to labor to understand

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:21.826
what had happened. He seemed not to feel sure he knew.

00:06:21.826 --> 00:06:26.215
Cut it off, and sold it, said Della. Don't you like me now?

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:30.922
I'm me, Jim. I'm the same without my hair. Jim looked around the

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:34.593
room. You say your hair is gone, he said. You don't have to look

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:38.502
for it, said Della. It's sold, I tell you. Sold and gone, too.

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:41.853
It's the night before Christmas, boy. Be good to me, because I

00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:45.045
sold it for you. Maybe the hairs of my head could be

00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:49.194
counted, she said. But no one could ever count my love for you.

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:52.784
Shall we eat dinner, Jim? Jim put his arms around his Della.

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:56.375
For ten seconds let us look in another direction. Eight dollars

00:06:56.375 --> 00:07:01.292
a week, or a million dollars a year. How different are they?

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:05.600
Someone may give. You and answer, but it will be wrong. The

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.510
Magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.021
My meaning will be explained soon. Someone may give you an

00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:17.010
answer, but it will be wrong. He threw it upon the table.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.319
I want you to understand me, Dell, he said. Nothing like a haircut

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.909
could make me love you any less. But if you'll open that, you may

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:28.579
know what I felt when I came in. White fingers pulled off the

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:32.409
paper, and then a cry of joy, and then a change to tears.

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.239
For there lay the combs. The combs that Della had seen in a

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:40.308
shop window, and loved for a long time. Beautiful combs, with

00:07:40.308 --> 00:07:44.377
jewels, perfect for her beautiful hair. She had known they cost too

00:07:44.377 --> 00:07:47.090
much for her to buy them. She had looked at them without the

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.000
least hope of owning them. And now they were hers, but her hair

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.590
was gone. But she held them to her heart, and at last was able

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.298
to look up and say, My hair grows so fast, Jim. And then she

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:03.846
jumped up and cried, Oh, oh! Jim had not yet seen his

00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:08.074
beautiful gift. She held it out to him in her open hand. The

00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:11.585
gold seemed to shine softly as if with her own warm and loving

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:15.415
spirit. Della, said he, Let's put our Christmas gifts away and

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:19.404
keep them awhile. They're too nice to use now. I sold the watch to

00:08:19.404 --> 00:08:22.436
get the money to buy the combs. And now I think we should have

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:27.383
our dinner. The Magi, as you know, were wise men, wonderfully

00:08:27.383 --> 00:08:31.452
wise men, who brought gifts to the newborn Christ child. They

00:08:31.452 --> 00:08:35.362
were the first to give Christmas gifts. Being wise, their gifts

00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:39.910
were doubtless wise ones. And here I have told you the story of

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.139
two children who were not wise. Each sold the most valuable

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:48.128
thing he owned in order to buy a gift for the other. But let me

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:52.038
speak a last word to the wise of these days. Of all who give

00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:56.905
gifts, these two were the most wise. Of all who give and

00:08:56.905 --> 00:09:01.533
receive gifts, such as, They are the most wise. Everywhere,

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:06.480
they are the wise ones. They are the Magi.
