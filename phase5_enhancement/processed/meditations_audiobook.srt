1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:15,050
1. From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper. From

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:22,300
the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother,

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,100
piety and beneficence and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,040
thoughts and, further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,740
the rich. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools and to have

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:48,040
had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should. From my governor,

7
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
to be neither of the Green nor of the Blue Party at the games in the circus,

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,660
nor a partisan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators' fights.

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:11,890
From him, too, from Diognotus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to give

10
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,770
credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantations and the

11
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,710
driving away of daemons in such things, and not to breed quails for fighting, nor to give

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,010
myself up passionately to such things, and to endure freedom of speech, and to have become

13
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,710
intimate with philosophy, and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchus, then of Tandisus

14
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,240
and Marcianus, and to have written dialogues in my youth, and to have desired a plank-bed

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,250
and ninskin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline. You need

16
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,850
to add some text for me to talk. From Rusticus, I received the impression that my character

17
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,570
required improvement and discipline, and from him I learned not to be led astray to

18
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,250
sophisticated emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering little

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,610
hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practices much discipline

20
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,750
or does benevolent acts in order to. You need to add some text for me to talk.

21
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,530
Make a display, and to abstain from rhetoric and poetry and fine writing, and not to

22
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,830
walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind, and

23
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,870
write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuesa

24
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,990
to my mother, and with respect to those who have offended me by words or done me wrong.

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,110
You need to add some text for me to talk. To be easily disposed, to be pacified and

26
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,130
reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled, and to read

27
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,410
carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book, nor

28
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,690
hastily to give my assent to those who talk over much, and I am indebted to him for

29
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,810
being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he, you need to add some

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,930
text for me to talk, from Apollonius. I learned freedom of will and undeviating

31
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:20,650
steadiness of purpose, and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to

32
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:28,590
reason. You need to add some text for me to talk. Yielding, and not peevish

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,050
giving his instruction, and to have had before my eyes a man who clearly

34
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,490
considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical principles as

35
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,550
the smallest of his merits, and from him I learned how to receive from friends

36
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,730
what are esteemed favors, without being either humbled by them or letting

37
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,880
them pass. You need to add some text for me to talk, from Sextus. A

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,740
benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,940
manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature, and gravity

40
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,220
without affectation, and to look carefully after the interests of

41
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,920
friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons and those who form opinions

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,820
without consideration, he had the power of readily. You need to add

43
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,260
some text for me to talk, accommodating himself to all, so that

44
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,660
the intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery, and at the same

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,860
time he was most highly venerated by those who associated with him, and he

46
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,240
had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent and

47
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,120
methodical way, the principles necessary for life, and he never showed

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,100
anger or any other, passion, but was entirely free from passion, and

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,920
also most affectionate, and he could express approbation without noisy

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,880
display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation. You need to add

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,890
some text for me to talk, from Alexander the Grammarian, to refrain from

52
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,110
fault, finding, and not in a reproachful way, to chide those who

53
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,940
uttered any barbarous or solicistic or strange, sounding expression,

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,460
but dexterously, to introduce the very expression which ought to have

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,070
been used, itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion,

56
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,230
from fronto, I learn to observe what envy and duplicity and hypocrisy

57
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,950
are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called

58
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,010
patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection. From

59
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,050
Alexander the Potonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say

60
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,170
to anyone, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure, nor

61
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,550
continually to, excuse the neglect of duties required by our

62
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,030
relation to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent inoccupations,

63
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,870
from Cotulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,870
if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him

65
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,210
to his usual disposition, and to be ready to speak well of teachers,

66
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:17,770
as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus, from my brother

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,610
Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice,

68
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,880
and through him I learn to know, Thrasya, Helvidius, Cato, Dion,

69
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,580
Brutus, and from him I received the idea of a polity in which

70
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,680
there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,020
to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, government which

72
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,160
respects most of all the freedom of the governed, I learn from

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,360
him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,760
philosophy, and a disposition to do good, with respect to those

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,060
whom he condemned, and that his friends had no need to conjecture

76
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,980
what he wished or did not wish, but it was quite plain, from

77
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,020
maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside

78
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:18,710
by anything, and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as an

79
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,420
illness, and a just admixture in the moral character of

80
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,140
sweetness and dignity, you need to add some text for me to talk,

81
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,180
I observe that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke,

82
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,620
and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention,

83
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,440
and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in

84
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,320
a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed

85
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,580
nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation,

86
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,080
nor, on the other hand, was he ever, he was accustomed to do

87
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,040
knacks of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free

88
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,950
from all falsehood, you need to add some text for me to talk,

89
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,610
in my father I observe mildness of temper, and unchangeable

90
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:22,640
resolution in the things which he had determined, to every

91
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,940
man according to his deserts, and a knowledge derived from

92
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:34,980
experience of the occasions for vigorous action, I observe,

93
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,180
too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by

94
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,180
Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man, he

95
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,180
had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way, and

96
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,980
I observe that he had overcome all passion for boys, and he

97
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,300
considered himself no more than any other citizen, and he

98
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,160
released his friends from all obligation, to sup with him,

99
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,000
or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,740
who had failed to accompany him by reason of any urgent

101
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,800
circumstances always found him the same, you need to add some

102
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,560
text for me to talk, I observe, too, his habit of careful

103
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,600
inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his

104
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,840
persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation

105
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,880
to being satisfied with appearances which first present

106
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,940
themselves, and that his disposition was to keep his

107
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,760
friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be

108
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,340
extravagant in his affection, you need to add some text

109
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,100
for me to talk, be satisfied on all occasions, and

110
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,840
cheerful, and to foresee things a long way off, and to

111
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,240
provide for the smallest without display, and to check

112
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,380
immediately popular applause in all flattery, and to be

113
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,080
ever watchful over the things which were necessary for

114
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,820
the administration of the empire, and to be a good

115
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,570
manager of the expenditure, you need to add some text

116
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,050
for me to talk, to endure the blame which he got for

117
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,350
such conduct, and he was neither superstitious with

118
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,170
respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts, or

119
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,950
by trying to please them, or by flattering the

120
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,420
populace, but he showed sobriety in all things and

121
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,720
firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,810
love of novelty, and the things which conduce in any

123
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,050
way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune

124
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,350
gives an abundant supply, he used, without arrogance,

125
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,050
and without excusing himself, so that when he had

126
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,610
them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when

127
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,570
he had them not, he did not want them. No one

128
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,390
could ever say of him that he was either a sophist

129
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,370
or a homebred flippant slave or a pedant, but

130
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,050
every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect,

131
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,470
above flattery, able to manage his own and other

132
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,190
men's affairs. Besides this, he honored those who

133
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,590
were true philosophers, and he did not reproach

134
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,790
those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet

135
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:21,810
was he easily led by them. He was also easy in

136
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,390
conversation, and he made himself agreeable without

137
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,370
any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable

138
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,310
care of his body's health, not as one who was

139
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,750
greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to

140
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,210
personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way. But

141
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,190
so, that, through his own attention, he very

142
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,350
seldom stood in need of the physician's art, or

143
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,790
of medicine or external applications. You need to

144
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,790
add some text for me to talk. He was most

145
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,550
ready to give way, without envy to those who

146
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,270
possessed any particular faculty, such as that of

147
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,750
eloquence or knowledge of the law, or of

148
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,830
anything else, and he gave them his help, that

149
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,350
each might enjoy reputation according to his

150
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:20,170
deserts. Further, he was not fond of change, nor

151
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,790
unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same

152
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,970
places, and to employ himself about the same

153
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,610
things. And after his paroxysms of headache,

154
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,410
he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his

155
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,530
usual occupations. You need to add some text

156
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,120
for me to talk. His secrets were not, but very

157
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,600
few and very rare, and these only about public

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,660
matters. He did not take the bath at

159
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,540
unseasonable hours. He was not fond of

160
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,480
building houses, nor curious about what he

161
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,890
ate, nor about the texture and color of his

162
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,110
clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves.

163
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,330
His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the

164
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,290
coast. We know how he behaved to the

165
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,370
people, collector at Tusculum, who asked his

166
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,650
pardon, and such was all his behavior. There

167
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,810
was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor

168
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,130
violent, nor, as one may say, anything

169
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,410
carried to the sweating point. But he

170
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,630
examined all things severally, as if he had

171
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,030
abundance of time and without confusion, in

172
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,550
an orderly way, and that might be applied

173
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,550
to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that

174
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,170
he was able both to abstain from, and to

175
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,830
enjoy, those things which many are too weak

176
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,490
to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without

177
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,330
excess. But to be strong enough both to

178
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,330
bear the one, and to be sober in the

179
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,770
other, is the mark of a man who has a

180
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,430
perfect and invincible soul, such as he

181
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,210
showed in the illness of Maximus. To the

182
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,950
gods, I am indebted for having good

183
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,230
grandfathers, good parents, a good sister,

184
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,170
good teachers, good associates, good

185
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,330
kinsmen and friends, nearly everything

186
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,430
good. Further, I owe it to the gods that

187
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,310
I was not hurried into, any offense

188
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,160
against any of them, though I had a

189
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,660
disposition which, if opportunity had

190
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,740
offered, might have led me to do

191
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,360
something of this kind, but, through

192
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,460
their favor, there never was such a

193
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,800
concurrence of circumstances as put me

194
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,180
to the trial. You need to add some text

195
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,140
for me to talk. Further, I am thankful

196
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,440
to the gods that I was not longer

197
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
brought up with my grandfather's

198
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
concubine, and that I preserved the

199
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,620
flower of my youth, and that I did

200
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,780
not make proof of my virility before

201
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,220
the proper season, but even end

202
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,520
deferred the time. You need to add

203
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,220
some text for me to talk. Me to the

204
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,320
knowledge that it is possible for a

205
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,380
man to live in a palace, without

206
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,100
wanting either guards or embroidered

207
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,400
dresses or torches and statues and

208
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,790
such, with respect to the things which

209
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,770
must be done for the public interest

210
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,730
in a manner that befits a ruler. You

211
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,330
need to add some text for me to

212
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,050
talk. I thank the gods for giving me

213
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,290
such a brother, who was able by his

214
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,170
moral character to rouse me to

215
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,870
vigilance over myself, and who, at

216
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,230
the same time, pleased me by his

217
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,450
respect and affection, that my

218
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,210
children have not been stupid nor

219
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,730
deformed in body, that I did not make

220
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,890
more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry

221
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,630
and the other studies, in which I

222
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,070
should. You need to add some text for

223
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,750
me to talk. Perhaps have been

224
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,410
completely engaged if I had seen that

225
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,930
I was making progress in them, that

226
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,730
I made haste to place those who

227
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,090
brought me up in the station of

228
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,270
honor, which they seemed to desire

229
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,760
without putting them off, with hope

230
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,770
of my doing it some time after. You

231
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,790
need to add some text for me to

232
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,310
talk. Receive clear and frequent

233
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,370
impressions about living according to

234
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,710
nature, and what kind of a life that

235
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,490
is, so that, so far as depended on

236
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,010
the gods and their gifts and help and

237
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,350
inspirations, nothing hindered me

238
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,270
from forthwith living according to

239
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,550
nature, though I still fall short of

240
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,970
it through my own fault and through

241
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,830
not observing thee. You need to add

242
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,870
some text for me to talk. Admonitions

243
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:50,380
of the gods, and, she spent the last

244
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,520
years of her life with me, that,

245
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,880
whenever I wished to help any man in

246
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,900
his need, or on any other occasion, I

247
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
was never told that I had not the

248
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,540
means of doing it, and that to myself

249
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,540
the same necessity never happened, to

250
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,940
receive anything from another. So

251
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,420
simple, that I had abundance of good

252
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,890
masters for my children, and that

253
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,570
remedies have been shown to me by

254
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,950
dreams, both others, and against

255
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,010
blood-spitting and giddiness, and that,

256
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,070
when I had an inclination to

257
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,690
philosophy, I did not fall into the

258
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,470
hands of any sophist, that I did not

259
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,210
waste my time on, writers of histories,

260
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,710
or in the resolution of syllogisms,

261
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,330
or occupy myself about the

262
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,150
investigation of appearances in the

263
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,710
heavens, for all these things require

264
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,590
the help of the gods and fortune,

265
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,540
among the Quadi at the Granua. Book 2

266
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
Begin the morning by saying to thyself,

267
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,780
I shall meet with the busybody, the

268
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,920
ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful,

269
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,820
envious, unsocial. All these things

270
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,500
happen to them by reason of their

271
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
ignorance of what is good and evil.

272
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,300
You need to add some text for me to

273
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,220
talk. But I who have seen the nature

274
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,440
of the good, that it is beautiful, and

275
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
of the bad, that it is ugly, and the

276
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,840
nature of him who does wrong, that it

277
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,980
is akin to me, not only of the same

278
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,440
blood or seed, but that it participates

279
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
in the same intelligence and the same

280
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,990
portion of the divinity. What is ugly,

281
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,190
nor can I be angry with my kinsmen,

282
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,970
nor hate him, for we are made for

283
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,170
cooperation, like feet, like hands,

284
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,610
like eyelids, like the rows of the

285
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,470
upper and lower teeth. To act against

286
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,370
one another, then, is contrary to

287
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,250
nature. And it is acting against one

288
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,630
other to be vexed, and to turn away.

289
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,890
Whatever this is that I am, it is a

290
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,230
little flesh and end breath, and the

291
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,350
ruling part. Throw away thy books, no

292
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,730
longer distract thyself. It is not

293
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,420
allowed. But as if thou wast now

294
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,300
dying, despise the flesh, it is blood

295
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,640
and bones and a network, a

296
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,660
contextual of nerves, veins, and

297
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,220
arteries. See? The breath? Also? What

298
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,460
kind of a thing it is? Air? And not

299
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,400
always the same, but every moment

300
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,060
send out and again sucked in. The third

301
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,880
then is the ruling part. Consider thus,

302
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,500
thou art an old man, no longer let

303
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,760
this be a slave, no longer be pulled

304
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,300
by the strings like a puppet to

305
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,620
unsocial movements, no longer either be

306
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,580
dissatisfied with thy present. All that

307
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,360
is from the gods is full of

308
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,670
providence. That which is from fortune

309
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,930
is not separated from nature, or

310
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,270
without an interweaving and

311
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,070
evolution with the things which are

312
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,510
ordered by providence. From thence all

313
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,310
things flow, and there is besides

314
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,270
necessity, and that which is for the

315
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,210
advantage of the whole universe, of

316
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,710
which thou art apart. But that is good

317
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,050
for every part of nature, which the

318
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:12,050
nature of the whole brings. Let these

319
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,950
principles be enough for thee, let

320
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,050
them always be fixed opinions. But

321
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,130
cast away the thirst after books,

322
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,050
that thou mayest not die murmuring,

323
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,010
but cheerfully, truly, and from thy

324
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,890
heart thankful to the gods. Remember

325
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,990
how long thou hast been putting off

326
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,290
these things, and how often thou hast

327
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,330
received an opportunity from the gods,

328
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,730
and yet dost not use it. Thou must now

329
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,830
at last perceive of what universe thou

330
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,850
art apart, and of what administrator of

331
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,650
the universe thy existence is an

332
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,390
efflux, and that a limit of time is

333
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,870
fixed for thee, which, if thou dost

334
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,430
not, use for clearing away the

335
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,610
clouds from thy mind, it will go and

336
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,310
thou wilt go, and it will never return.

337
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,470
Never moment think steadily as a Roman,

338
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,830
and a man to do what thou hast in hand

339
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:11,360
with perfect and simple dignity, and

340
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,250
feeling of affection and freedom, and

341
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,830
thou will give thyself relief if

342
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,290
thou doest every act of thy life.

343
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,100
Thou seest how few the things are,

344
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,760
the which, if a man lays hold of, he

345
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,380
is able to live, a life which flows

346
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,060
in quiet, and is like the existence of

347
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,700
the gods, for the gods on their part

348
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
will require nothing more from him who

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,660
observes these things. Do wrong to

350
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,060
thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul,

351
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,080
but thou wilt no longer have the

352
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
opportunity of honoring thyself. Every

353
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
man's life is sufficient, but thine

354
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,400
is nearly finished, though thy soul

355
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,560
reverence is not itself, but places

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,100
thy felicity in the souls of others. Do

357
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,120
the things external which fall upon thee

358
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,520
distract thee, give thyself time to

359
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,900
learn something new and good, and cease

360
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,670
to be whirled around, but then thou must

361
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,490
also avoid being carried about the

362
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,010
other way. For those too are triflers

363
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,750
who have wearied themselves in life

364
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,630
by their activity, and yet have no

365
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,290
object to which to direct every

366
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,970
movement and, in a word, all their

367
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,630
thoughts. Through not observing what

368
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,130
is in the mind of another, a man has

369
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,860
seldom been seen to be unhappy. But

370
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,880
those who do not observe the movements

371
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,780
of their own minds must of. You need to

372
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,160
add some text for me to talk. This

373
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,960
thou must always bear in mind. What is

374
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,300
the nature of the whole, and what is my

375
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,460
nature, and how this is related to

376
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,660
that? The Ephrastus, in his comparison

377
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,100
of bad acts, such a comparison as

378
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,640
one would make in accordance with the

379
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,540
common notions of mankind, says, like

380
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,700
a true philosopher, that the offenses

381
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,180
which are committed through desire

382
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,780
are more blamable than those which are

383
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,500
committed through anger. For he who is

384
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,840
excited by anger seems to turn away

385
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,020
from reason with a certain pain and

386
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,680
unconscious contraction. But he who

387
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,600
offends through desire, being

388
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,800
overpowered by pleasure, seems to be

389
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,440
in a manner more intemperate and

390
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,940
more womanish in his offenses. You

391
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,800
need to add some text for me to

392
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,060
talk. Rightly then, and in a way

393
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,040
worthy of philosophy, he said that

394
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,620
the offense which is committed with

395
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,040
pleasure is more blamable than that

396
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,420
which is committed with pain, and on the

397
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,260
whole the one is more like a person who

398
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,080
has been first wronged and through

399
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,170
pain is compelled to be angry. Since it

400
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,290
is possible that thou mayest apart

401
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,710
from life this very moment, regulate

402
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,370
every act and thought accordingly. But

403
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,810
to go away from among men, if there

404
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,870
are gods, is not a thing to be

405
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,510
afraid of. For the gods will not

406
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,270
involve thee in evil. But if indeed

407
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,870
they do not exist, or if they have no

408
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,690
concern about human affairs, what is it

409
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,630
to me to live? In a universe devoid

410
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,650
of gods, or devoid of providence. But

411
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,930
in truth they do exist, and they do

412
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,790
care for human things, and they have

413
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,790
put all the means in man's power to

414
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,850
enable him not to fall into real

415
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,170
evils. And as to the rest, if there

416
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,210
was anything evil, they would have

417
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,270
provided for this also, that it should

418
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,010
be altogether in a man's power not to

419
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,650
fall into it. You need to add some text

420
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,850
for me to talk. But neither through

421
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,890
ignorance, nor having the end

422
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,290
knowledge, but not the power to guard

423
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,850
against or correct these things, is it

424
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,910
possible that the nature of the

425
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,510
universe has overlooked them? Nor is

426
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,610
it possible that it has made so

427
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,610
great a mistake, either through want

428
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,290
of power or want of skill, that good

429
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,470
and evil should happen

430
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,060
indiscriminately to the you. Now that

431
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,560
which does not make a man worse, how

432
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,640
can it make a man's life worse? But

433
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,800
death, certainly, and life, honor and

434
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,760
dishonor, pain and pleasure, all these

435
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,720
things equally happen to good men

436
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,080
and bad, being things which make us

437
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,020
neither better nor worse. You need to

438
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,940
add some text for me to talk. How

439
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,640
quickly all things disappear, in the

440
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,220
universe the bodies themselves, but in

441
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,700
time the remembrance of them. What is

442
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,420
the nature of all sensible things, and

443
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,600
particularly those which attract with

444
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,580
the bade of pleasure or terrify by

445
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,200
pain, or are noised abroad by

446
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,020
vapoury fame, are? All this it is the

447
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,960
part of the intellectual faculty to

448
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,360
observe. To observe, too, who these

449
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,920
are, whose opinions and voices give

450
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,560
What death is, and the fact that, if a

451
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,520
man looks at it in itself, and by the

452
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,820
abstractive power of reflection resolves

453
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,160
into their parts all the things which

454
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,600
present themselves to the

455
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,980
imagination in it, he will then

456
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,100
consider it to be nothing else than

457
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,920
an operation of nature. If anyone is

458
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,680
afraid of an operation of nature, he is

459
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,360
a child. Therefore, they are neither

460
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,770
This, however, is not only an operation

461
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,410
of nature, but it is also a thing which

462
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,770
conduces to the purposes of nature. To

463
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,170
observe, too, how man comes near to

464
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,810
the deity, and by what part of him,

465
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,050
and when this part of man is so

466
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,100
disposed. You need to add some text

467
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,810
for me to talk. Nothing is more

468
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,570
wretched than a man who traverses

469
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,410
everything and around, and pries into

470
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,890
the things beneath the earth, as the

471
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,530
poet says, and seeks by conjecture what

472
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,590
is in the minds of his neighbors,

473
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,970
without perceiving that it is

474
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,750
sufficient to attend to the daemon

475
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,070
within him, and to reverence it

476
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,610
sincerely for their excellence, and

477
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,310
the things from men should be dear to

478
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,650
us by reason of kinship, and

479
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,610
sometimes even, in a manner, they move

480
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,630
our pity by reason of men's ignorance

481
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:41,550
of good and bad, being not less than

482
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,590
that which deprives us of the power of

483
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,230
distinguishing things that are white,

484
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,950
and reverence of the daemon consists

485
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,110
in keeping it pure from passion and

486
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,130
thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction

487
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,130
with what comes from gods and men.

488
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,930
Though thou shouldst be going to live

489
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,850
three thousand years, and as many

490
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,050
times ten thousand years, still

491
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,350
remember that no man loses any other

492
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,530
life than this which he now lives,

493
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,530
nor lives any other than. The longest

494
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,490
and shortest are thus brought to the

495
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,730
same, for the present is the same to

496
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,110
all, though that which perishes is not

497
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,170
the same, and so that which is lost

498
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,090
appears to be a mere moment. For a man

499
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,090
cannot lose either the past or the

500
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,650
future, for what a man has not, how

501
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,170
can anyone take this from him? You

502
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,950
need to add some text for me to

503
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,870
talk. These two things then thou must

504
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,630
bear in mind, the one that all things

505
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,990
for maternity are of like forms and

506
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,110
come round in a circle, and that it

507
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,990
makes no difference whether a man

508
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,890
shall see the same things during a

509
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,130
hundred years or two hundred or an

510
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:51,700
infinite time. For the present is the

511
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,640
only thing of which a man can be

512
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,220
deprived if it is true that this is

513
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,740
the only thing which he has, and that

514
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,920
a man cannot lose a thing if he has

515
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:08,240
it not. For what was said by the

516
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
Cynicmonimus is manifest, and

517
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,220
manifest, too, is the use of what was

518
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,780
said. The soul of man does violence to

519
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,520
itself, first of all when it becomes

520
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,580
an abscess and, as it were, a tumor on

521
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,440
the universe so far as it can, for to

522
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,800
be vexed at anything which happens is

523
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,740
a separation of ourselves from nature,

524
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,000
in some part of which the natures of

525
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,500
all other things are contained. In the

526
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,720
next place the soul does violence to

527
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,460
itself when it turns away from any

528
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,920
man, or even moves towards him with

529
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,180
the intention of injuring, such as

530
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,060
are the souls of those who are angry.

531
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,680
In the third place the soul does

532
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,600
violence to itself when it is

533
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,720
overpowered by pleasure or by pain.

534
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Fourthly, when it plays a part and does

535
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,360
or says anything insincerely and

536
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,460
untruly. Fifthly, when it allows any

537
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,760
act of its own and any movement to

538
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,920
be without an aim and does anything

539
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,740
thoughtlessly and without considering

540
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,960
what it is, it being right, that even

541
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,540
the smallest things be done with

542
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,600
reference to an end, and the end of

543
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,220
animals is to follow the reason and the

544
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,240
law of the most ancient city in polity.

545
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,980
Of human life the time is a point, and

546
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,420
the substance is in a flux, and the

547
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,700
perception dull, and the composition

548
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,860
of the whole body subject to

549
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,400
putrefaction, and the soul a whirl,

550
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,000
and fortune hard to divine, and fame

551
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,980
a thing devoid of judgment. And, to

552
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,320
say all in a word, everything which

553
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,720
belongs to the body is a stream, and

554
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,660
what belongs to the soul is a dream and

555
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,040
vapor, and life is a warfare and a

556
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,520
stranger sojourn. You need to add some

557
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,760
text for me to talk, but this

558
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,680
consists in keeping the daemon within

559
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,880
a man free from violence and unharmed

560
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,020
superior to pains and pleasures, doing

561
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,720
nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely

562
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,380
and with hypocrisy, not feeling the

563
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,360
need of another man's doing or not

564
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:26,120
doing anything, besides accepting all

565
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,160
that happens and all that is allotted

566
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,080
as coming from thence, wherever it is,

567
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,860
from whence he himself came, and

568
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,960
finally waiting for death with a

569
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,200
cheerful mind as being nothing else

570
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,060
than a dissolution of the elements of

571
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,580
which every living being is

572
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,820
compounded. What then is that which

573
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,500
is able to conduct a man? One thing

574
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,000
and only one philosophy. And, but if

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,380
there is no harm to the elements

576
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,200
themselves, in each continually

577
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,090
changing into another, why should a man

578
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,090
have any apprehension about the change

579
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,960
in dissolution of all the elements? We

580
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,760
ought to consider not only that our

581
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,980
life is daily wasting away and a

582
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,820
smaller part of it is left, but

583
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,800
another thing also must be taken into

584
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,870
the account. That if a man should live

585
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,850
longer, it is quite uncertain whether

586
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,550
the understanding will still continue

587
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,230
sufficient for the comprehension of

588
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,170
things, and retain the power of

589
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,300
contemplation which strives to acquire

590
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,980
the knowledge of the divine and the

591
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,640
human. You need to add some text for me

592
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,080
to talk, for if he shall begin to fall

593
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,320
into dotage. Perspiration and nutrition

594
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,560
and imagination and appetite, and

595
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,520
whatever else there is of the kind,

596
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,400
will not fail. But the power of

597
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,920
making use of ourselves, and filling

598
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,120
up the measure of our duty, and

599
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,800
clearly separating all appearances, and

600
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,320
considering whether a man should now

601
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,420
depart from life, and whatever else of

602
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,600
the kind, absolutely requires a

603
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,740
disciplined reason. All this is

604
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,980
already extinguished, for it is

605
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,140
according to nature, and nothing is

606
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,940
evil which is according to nature.

607
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,900
Look! We ought to observe also that

608
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,540
even the things which follow after

609
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,020
the things which are produced according

610
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,160
to nature, contain something pleasing

611
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,180
and attractive. For instance, when

612
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,880
bread is baked, some parts are split

613
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,500
at the surface, and these parts which

614
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,900
thus open, and have a certain fashion

615
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,680
contrary to the purpose of the baker's

616
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,020
art, are beautiful in a manner, and in

617
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,480
a peculiar way excite a desire for

618
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,220
eating, eyebrows, and the foam which

619
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,280
flows from the mouth of wild boars,

620
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,880
and many other things, though they are

621
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,980
far from being beautiful, if a man

622
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,430
should examine them severly. Still,

623
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,810
because they are consequent upon the

624
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,720
things which are formed by nature, help

625
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,180
to adorn them, and they please the mind,

626
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,900
so, that if a man should have a feeling

627
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,380
and deeper insight with respect to

628
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,100
the things which are produced in the

629
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,890
universe, there is hardly one of those

630
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,790
which follow by way of consequence,

631
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,370
which will not seem to him to be in

632
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,510
a manner disposed so as to give

633
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,890
pleasure. You need to add some text

634
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,910
for me to talk. And so, he will see

635
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,430
even the real gaping jaws of wild

636
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,630
beasts with no less pleasure than

637
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,650
those which painters and sculptors show

638
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,970
by imitation, and in an old woman and

639
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,160
an old man, he will be able to see a

640
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,590
certain maturity and comeliness, and the

641
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,970
attractive loveliness of young

642
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,810
persons he will be able to look on

643
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,080
with chaste eyes, okay, will present

644
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
themselves, not pleasing to every

645
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,600
man, but to him only who has become

646
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,560
truly familiar with nature and her

647
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,960
works, and again, figs, when they are

648
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,340
quite ripe, gape open, and, in the ripe

649
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,900
olives, the very circumstance of their

650
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,160
being near to rottenness adds a

651
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,550
peculiar beauty to the fruit. The

652
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,750
Childe foretold the deaths of many,

653
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,730
and then fate caught them too.

654
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,520
Alexander and Pompeius and Chias Caesar,

655
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,040
after so often completely destroying

656
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
whole cities and in battle cutting to

657
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,860
pieces, many ten thousands of cavalry

658
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:46,200
and infantry. Heraclitus, after so

659
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
many speculations on the conflagration

660
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,880
of the universe, was filled with water

661
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,620
internally and died smeared all over

662
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,500
with mud, and lice destroyed Democritus,

663
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,920
and other lice killed Socrates. What

664
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,480
means all this? Thou hast embarked,

665
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,020
thou hast made the voyage, thou art

666
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,840
come to shore, wan, get out. If indeed

667
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,660
to another life there is no want of

668
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,730
gods, not even there. But if to a

669
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,310
state without sensation, thou wilt cease

670
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,610
to be held by pains and pleasures, and

671
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,790
to be a slave to the vessel, which is

672
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,830
as much inferior as that which serves

673
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,550
it is. Superior, for the one is

674
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,670
intelligence and deity, the other is

675
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,370
earth and corruption. Do not waste the

676
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,370
remainder of thy life in thoughts

677
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,790
about others, when thou dost not refer

678
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,150
thy thoughts to some object of common

679
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,330
utility. For thou looses the

680
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,190
opportunity of doing something else,

681
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,090
when thou hast such thoughts as

682
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,650
these. What is such a person doing,

683
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,510
and why, and what is he saying, and what

684
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,450
is he thinking of, and what is he

685
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,930
contriving? And whatever else of the

686
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,910
kind makes us wander away from the

687
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,030
observation of our own ruling power.

688
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,090
We ought then to check in the series

689
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,070
of our thoughts everything that is

690
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,730
without a purpose and useless, but most

691
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,150
of all the over-curious feeling and

692
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,290
the malignant, and a man should use

693
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,010
himself to think of those things,

694
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,710
only about which, if one should

695
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,930
With perfect openness thou mightest

696
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,990
immediately answer this or that, so that

697
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,730
from thy words it should be plain

698
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,950
that everything in thee is simple and

699
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,070
benevolent, and such as befits a

700
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,770
social animal, and one that cares not

701
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,370
for thoughts about pleasure, or sensual

702
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,460
enjoyments at all, nor has any rivalry

703
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,200
or envy and suspicion, or anything

704
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,700
else for which. Thou wouldst blush, if

705
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,300
thou shouldst say that thou hadst it in

706
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,560
thy mind. You need to add some text for

707
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,400
me to talk. For the man who is such,

708
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,900
and no longer delays being among the

709
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,380
number of the best, is like a priest

710
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,420
and minister of the gods, using too

711
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,880
the deity which is planted within him,

712
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,080
which makes the man uncontaminated by

713
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,960
pleasure, unharmed by any pain,

714
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,040
untouched by any insult, feeling no

715
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,980
wrong, a fighter in the noblest fight,

716
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,500
by any passion, died deep with justice,

717
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,570
accepting with all his soul everything

718
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,650
which happens, and is assigned to him

719
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:32,010
as his portion, for it is only what

720
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,010
belongs to himself that he makes

721
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,210
the matter for his activity, and he

722
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,010
constantly thinks of that which is

723
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,030
allotted to himself out of the sum

724
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,350
total of things, and he makes his

725
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,160
own acts fair, and he is persuaded that

726
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,900
his own portion is good, for the lot

727
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,080
which is assigned to each man is

728
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,140
carried along with him, and carries him

729
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,480
along with it, and he remembers also

730
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,280
that every rational animal is his

731
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,020
kinsman. But as to those who live not

732
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,120
so, he always bears in mind what kind

733
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,800
of men they are both at home and from

734
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,140
home, both by night and by day, and

735
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,820
what they are, and with what men they

736
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,260
live, and in pure life. Accordingly, he

737
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,220
does not value at all the praise which

738
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,380
comes from such men, since they are not

739
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,800
even satisfied with themselves. Labor

740
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,180
not unwillingly, nor without regard to

741
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,320
the common interest, nor without due

742
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,700
consideration, nor with distraction,

743
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,040
nor let studied ornaments set off

744
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,280
thy thoughts, and be not either a

745
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,700
man of many words, or busy about too

746
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,410
many things. Be the guardian of a

747
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,190
living being, manly, and of ripe age,

748
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,050
and engaged in matter political, and a

749
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,330
Roman, and a ruler, who has taken his

750
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,270
post like a man waiting for the signal

751
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,530
which summons him from life, and ready

752
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,010
to go, having need neither of oath nor

753
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,590
of any man's testimony. You need to add

754
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,110
some text for me to talk. If thou

755
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,730
findest in human life anything

756
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,710
better than justice, truth, temperance,

757
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,130
fortitude, and, in a word, anything

758
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:18,900
better than thy own mind's self. This

759
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,500
turn to it with all thy soul, and

760
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
enjoy that which thou hast found to be

761
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,900
the best. You need to add some text

762
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,560
for me to talk. But if nothing appears

763
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,360
to be better than the deity which has

764
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,340
planted in thee, which has subjected

765
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,960
to itself all thy appetites, and

766
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,660
carefully examines all the

767
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,420
impressions, and, as Socrates said,

768
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,760
has detached itself from the

769
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:53,960
persuasions of sense. You need to add

770
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,660
some text for me to talk. Of less

771
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,120
values in this, give place to nothing

772
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,080
else, for thou dost once diverge and

773
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,380
incline to it, thou wilt no longer

774
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,870
without distraction. Pleasure should

775
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,530
come into competition with that which

776
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,990
is rationally and politically or

777
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,450
practically good. Be cheerful also, and

778
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,530
seek not external help nor the

779
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:25,680
tranquility which others give. But do

780
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,520
thou, I say, simply and freely choose

781
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,200
the better, and hold to it. But that

782
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,570
which is useful is the better. Well then,

783
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,370
if it is useful to thee as a rational

784
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,510
being, keep to it. But if it is only

785
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,730
useful to thee as an animal, say so,

786
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,930
and maintain thy judgment without

787
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,490
arrogance. Only take care that thou

788
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,670
makest the inquiry by a sure method.

789
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,610
You need to add some text for me to

790
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,210
talk. Never value anything as

791
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,890
profitable to thyself, which shall

792
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,150
compel thee to break thy promise, to

793
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,870
lose thy self-respect, to hate any man,

794
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,530
to suspect, to curse, to act the

795
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,970
hypocrite, to desire anything which

796
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,690
needs walls and curtains. For he who

797
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,990
has preferred to everything,

798
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,050
intelligence and daemon and the

799
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,410
worship of its excellence, acts no

800
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,110
tragic part, does not groan, in will

801
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,930
not need either solitude or much

802
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,710
company. And what is chief of all, he

803
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,610
will live without either pursuing or

804
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,630
flying from death. But whether for a

805
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,910
longer or a shorter time he shall have

806
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,310
the soul enclosed in the body, he cares

807
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,510
not at all. For even if he must depart

808
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,010
immediately, he will go as readily as

809
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,830
if he were going to do. Anything else

810
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,110
which can be done with decency and

811
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,970
order, taking care of this only all

812
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,030
through life, that his thoughts turn

813
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,510
not away from anything which belongs

814
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,970
to an intelligent animal and a member

815
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,470
of a civil community. In the mind of

816
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,230
one who is chastened and purified, thou

817
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,710
wilt find no corrupt matter, nor

818
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,330
impurity, nor any sore skinned over.

819
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,180
Besides, there is in him nothing

820
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,340
servile, nor affected, nor too closely

821
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,500
bound to other things, nor yet

822
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,000
detached from other things, nothing

823
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,320
worthy of blame, nothing which seeks a

824
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,240
hiding place. Reverence the faculty

825
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,240
which produces opinion. On this faculty

826
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
it entirely depends whether there shall

827
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,700
exist, in thy ruling part, any opinion

828
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,120
inconsistent with nature and the

829
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,540
constitution of the rational animal.

830
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,650
Throwing away, then, all things. Hold

831
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,270
to these only which are few, and

832
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,390
besides, bear in mind that every man,

833
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,210
this barren mind, this present time,

834
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,810
which is an indivisible point, and

835
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,810
that all the rest of his life is

836
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,480
either past or it is uncertain. Short,

837
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,180
then, is the time which every man lives,

838
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,600
and small the nook of the earth where

839
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,580
he lives. To the aids which have been

840
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,840
mentioned, let this one still be added,

841
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,180
make for thyself a definition or

842
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,860
description of the thing which is

843
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,820
presented to thee, so as to see

844
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,780
distinctly what kind of a thing it

845
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,360
is in its substance, in its nudity, in

846
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:44,100
its complete entirety. You need to add

847
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,760
some text for me to talk, for nothing is

848
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,380
so productive of elevation of mind as

849
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,880
to be able to examine methodically and

850
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,280
truly every object which is presented

851
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,020
to thee in life, and always to look

852
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,160
at things, so as to see at the same

853
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,720
time what kind of universe this is,

854
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,580
and what kind of use everything

855
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,700
performs in it, and what value

856
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,600
everything has with reference to the

857
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,520
whole, and you need to add some text

858
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,270
for me to talk. What with reference to

859
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,170
man, who is a citizen of the highest

860
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,430
city, of which all other cities are like

861
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,130
families, what each thing is, and of

862
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,370
what it is composed, and how long it

863
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,170
is the nature of this thing to endure,

864
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,000
which now makes an impression on me,

865
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,180
and what virtue I have need of with

866
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,180
respect to it, such as gentleness,

867
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,540
manliness, truth, fidelity. You need to

868
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,200
add some text for me to talk.

869
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,100
Wherefore on every occasion a man

870
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,820
should say, This comes from God, and this

871
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,640
is according to the apportionment and

872
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,840
spinning of the thread of destiny, and

873
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,990
such, like coincidence and chance, and

874
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,810
this is from one of the same stock,

875
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,510
and a kinsman and partner, one who

876
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,590
knows not, however, what is according

877
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,770
to his nature. But I know, for this

878
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,850
reason, I behave towards him according

879
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,330
to the natural law of fellowship, with

880
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,560
benevolence and justice. At the same

881
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,920
time, however, in things indifferent I

882
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,180
attempt to ascertain the value of each.

883
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,540
You need to add some text for me to

884
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,160
talk. If thou workest at that which

885
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,900
is before thee, following right reason,

886
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,620
seriously, vigorously, calmly, without

887
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,020
allowing anything else to distract thee,

888
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,480
but keeping thy divine part pure,

889
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,040
according to nature, and with

890
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,220
heroic truth in every word and sound

891
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,320
which thou utterest, thou wilt live

892
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,980
happy, and there is no man who is able

893
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,600
to prevent this. As physicians have

894
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,940
always their instruments and knives

895
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,460
ready for cases which suddenly require

896
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,560
their skill, so do thou have

897
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,440
principles ready for the understanding

898
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,400
of things divine and human, and for

899
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,600
doing everything, even the smallest,

900
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,000
with a recollection of the bond which

901
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,360
unites the divine and human. For

902
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,340
neither wilt thou do anything well

903
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,920
which pertains to man, without at the

904
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,040
same time having a reference to things

905
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,760
divine, nor the contrary, no longer

906
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,900
wander at hazard. For neither wilt thou

907
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,400
read thy own memoirs, nor the acts of

908
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,760
the ancient Romans and Hellenes, and

909
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,020
the selections from books which thou was

910
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,400
reserving for thy old age. Hasten,

911
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,140
then, to the end which thou hast

912
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,360
before thee, and throwing away idle

913
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,700
hopes come to thy own aid if thou

914
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,020
carest at all for thyself, while it

915
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,880
is in thy power. They know not how many

916
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,580
things are signified by the words

917
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,500
stealing, sewing, buying, keeping quiet,

918
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,860
seeing what ought to be done, for this

919
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,140
is not affected by the eyes, but by

920
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,380
another kind. You need to add some

921
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,840
text for me to talk. To receive the

922
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,900
impressions of forms by means of

923
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,280
appearances belongs even to animals. To

924
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,220
be pulled by the strings of desire

925
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,360
belongs both to wild beasts and to

926
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,120
men who have made themselves into

927
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,460
women, and to a Filaris and a Nero, and

928
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,260
to have the intelligence that guides

929
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,760
to the end things which appear

930
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,480
suitable belongs also to those who do

931
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,220
not believe, in the gods, and who

932
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,060
betray their country and do their

933
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,640
impure deeds when they have shut the

934
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,480
doors. If then, everything else is

935
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,080
common to all that I have mentioned.

936
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,060
Obediently as a god, neither saying

937
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,400
anything contrary to the truth, nor

938
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
doing anything contrary to justice.

939
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,640
Body, soul, intelligence, to the body,

940
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,400
belong sensations, to the soul,

941
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,940
appetites, to the intelligence

942
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,800
principles. And if all men refuse to

943
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,820
believe that he lives a simple,

944
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,140
modest, and contented life, he is

945
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,740
neither angry with any of them, nor

946
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,780
does he deviate from the way which

947
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,220
leads to the end of life, to which a

948
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,680
man ought to come, pure, tranquil,

949
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,820
ready to depart, and without any

950
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,940
compulsion, perfectly reconciled to

951
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,560
his lot. Book 4. That which rules within,

952
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,960
when it is according to nature, is so

953
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,580
affected with respect to the events

954
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,880
which happen, that it always easily

955
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,280
adapts itself to that which is and is

956
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,480
presented to it. You need to add some

957
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,280
text for me to talk, for it requires

958
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,700
no definite material, but it moves

959
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,720
towards its purpose, under certain

960
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,980
conditions, however, and it makes a

961
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,500
material for itself out of that which

962
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,020
opposes it, as fire lays hold of

963
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,440
what falls into it, by which a small

964
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
light would have been extinguished, but

965
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,900
when the fire is strong, it soon

966
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,540
appropriates to itself the matter which

967
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,360
is, heaped on it, and consumes it, and

968
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,500
rises higher by means of this very

969
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,900
material. Let no act be done without

970
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,920
a purpose, nor otherwise, than

971
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,620
according to the perfect principles of

972
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,950
art. Men seek retreats for themselves,

973
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,750
houses in the country, seashores,

974
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:14,960
and mountains for

975
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,390
to desire such things very much, but

976
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,530
this is altogether a mark of the most

977
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,070
common sort of men, for it is in thy

978
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,350
power, whenever thou shalt choose to

979
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,190
retire into thyself. For nowhere,

980
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,450
either with more quiet or more freedom

981
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,690
from trouble, does a man retire than

982
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,690
into his own soul, particularly when he

983
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,010
has within him such thoughts that by

984
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,190
looking into them he is immediately

985
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,070
imperfect. Tranquility, and I affirm that

986
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,330
tranquility is nothing else than the

987
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,190
good ordering of the mind. Constantly

988
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,490
then give to thyself this retreat, and

989
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,610
renew thyself, and let thy principles

990
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,250
be brief and fundamental, which, as

991
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,730
soon as thou shalt recur to them,

992
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,690
will be sufficient to cleanse the

993
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,030
soul completely, and to send thee back

994
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,130
free from all discontent with the

995
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,270
things to which thou returnest. For

996
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,170
with what art thou discontented, with

997
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,310
the badness of men? Recall to thy mind

998
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,450
this conclusion, that rational animals

999
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,650
exist for one another, and that to

1000
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,910
endure is a part of justice, and that

1001
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,130
men do wrong involuntarily, and

1002
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,170
consider how many already, after

1003
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,850
mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and

1004
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,690
fighting, have been stretched dead,

1005
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,030
reduced to ashes, but perhaps? Thou

1006
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,450
art dissatisfied with that which is

1007
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:35,770
assigned to thee out of the

1008
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,830
Recall to thy recollection this

1009
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,090
alternative. Either there is

1010
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,770
providence or atoms, fortuitous

1011
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,330
concurrence of things, or remember the

1012
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,270
arguments by which it has been proved

1013
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,590
that the world is a kind of political

1014
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,990
community, and be quiet at last. But

1015
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,410
perhaps corporeal things will still

1016
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,830
fasten upon thee. Consider then

1017
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,850
further, that the mind mingles not

1018
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,510
with the breath, whether moving

1019
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,490
gently or violently. When it has once

1020
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,570
drawn itself apart and discovered its

1021
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,130
own power, and think also of all that

1022
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,490
thou hast heard and assented to about

1023
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,910
pain and pleasure, and be quiet at

1024
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,860
last. But perhaps the desire of the

1025
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,180
thing called fame will torment thee.

1026
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,860
See how soon everything is forgotten,

1027
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,500
and look at the chaos of infinite

1028
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,440
time on each side of the present,

1029
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,700
and the emptiness of applause, and

1030
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,500
the changeableness, nand want of

1031
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:43,140
judgment. For the whole earth is a

1032
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,440
point, and how small a nook in it is

1033
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,580
this thy dwelling, and how few are

1034
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,740
there in it, and what kind of people

1035
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,220
are they who will praise thee. This

1036
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,180
then remains. Remember to retire into

1037
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,740
this little territory of thy own, and

1038
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,840
above all do not distract or strain

1039
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,400
thyself, but be free, and look at

1040
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,840
things as a man, as a human. But

1041
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,420
among the things readiest to thy

1042
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,100
hand, to which thou shall turn, let

1043
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:14,210
there be these, which are two. The

1044
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,650
other is, that all these things which

1045
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,290
thou seest change immediately, and will

1046
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,850
no longer be, and constantly bear in

1047
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,030
mind how many of these changes thou

1048
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:30,870
hast already witnessed. You need to add

1049
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,450
some text for me to talk. If our

1050
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,770
intellectual part is common, the

1051
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:38,130
reason also, in respect of which we

1052
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,630
are rational beings, is common. If

1053
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,510
this is so, common also is the reason

1054
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,230
which commands us what to do, and what

1055
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:55,850
not to do. If this is so, for of what

1056
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,870
other common political community will

1057
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,570
anyone say that the whole human race

1058
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:07,830
are members? You need to add some text

1059
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,310
for me to talk, for as my earthly

1060
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,930
part is a portion given to me from

1061
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,950
certain earth, and that which is

1062
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,390
watery from another element, and that

1063
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,490
which is hot and fiery from some

1064
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,370
peculiar source, for nothing comes out

1065
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,650
of that which is nothing, as nothing

1066
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,450
also returns to non-existence, so

1067
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,030
also the intellectual part comes from

1068
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:34,180
some source. Death, such as generation

1069
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,640
is, a mystery of nature, a composition

1070
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,740
out of the same elements, and a

1071
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,100
decomposition into the same, and

1072
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,640
altogether not, a thing of which any

1073
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,240
man should be ashamed. For it is not

1074
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,720
contrary to the nature of a

1075
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,080
reasonable animal, and not contrary

1076
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,000
to the reason of our constitution. It is

1077
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,860
natural that these things should be

1078
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,200
done by such persons. It is a matter of

1079
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,580
necessity, and if a man will not have

1080
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:05,140
it so, he will not allow the fig tree

1081
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,270
to have juice. But by all means bear

1082
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,690
this in mind, that within a very

1083
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,030
short time both thou and he will be

1084
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,830
dead, and soon not even your names

1085
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,310
will be left behind. Take away thy

1086
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,110
opinion, and then there is taken away

1087
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,910
the complaint, I have been harmed. Take

1088
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,030
away the complaint, I have been harmed,

1089
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,830
and the harm is taken away. That which

1090
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,750
does not make a man worse than he was,

1091
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,590
also does not make his life worse, nor

1092
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,510
does it harm him, either from without

1093
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,410
or from within. The nature of that

1094
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,870
which is universally useful has been

1095
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,610
compelled to do this. Consider that

1096
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,290
everything which happens, happens

1097
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,950
justly, and if thou observe us

1098
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,990
carefully, thou wilt find it to be

1099
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,110
good. I do not say only with respect

1100
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,030
to the continuity of the series of

1101
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:55,090
things, but with respect to what is

1102
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,670
just, and as if it were done by one

1103
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,870
who assigns to, observe then as thou

1104
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,930
hast begun, and whatever thou doest,

1105
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,410
do it in conjunction with this, the

1106
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,030
being good, and in the sense in

1107
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,030
which a man is properly understood to

1108
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,740
be good. Keep to this in every

1109
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,460
action, and do not have such an

1110
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,720
opinion of things as he has who does

1111
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,140
thee wrong, or such as he wishes thee

1112
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,620
to have, but look at them as they are

1113
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,260
in truth. A man should always have

1114
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,920
these two rules, in readiness. The

1115
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,460
one, to do only whatever the reason

1116
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,420
of the ruling and legislating faculty

1117
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,010
may suggest, for the use of men. The

1118
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,430
other, to change thy opinion, if

1119
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,810
there is any one at hand who sets

1120
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,630
thee right and moves thee from any

1121
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,050
opinion. But this change of opinion

1122
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,710
must proceed only from a certain

1123
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,130
persuasion, as of what is just or of

1124
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,470
common advantage, and the like, not

1125
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,110
because it appears pleasant or brings

1126
00:56:54,110 --> 00:57:01,540
reputation. Why then dost not thou use

1127
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,520
it? For if this does its own work,

1128
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:16,650
what else dost thou wish? What else

1129
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,980
dost thou wish? Thou shalt disappear

1130
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,470
in that which produced thee, but

1131
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,090
rather thou shalt be received back

1132
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,550
into its seminal principle by

1133
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,670
transmutation. Many grains of

1134
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,890
frankincense on the same altar, one

1135
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,270
falls before, another falls after, but

1136
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,280
it makes no difference. Within ten

1137
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,740
days thou wilt seem a god to those to

1138
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,500
whom thou art now, a beast and an ape,

1139
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
if thou wilt return to thy principles

1140
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,340
and the worship of reason. Do not act

1141
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,960
as if thou were going to live ten

1142
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,300
thousand years. Death hangs over thee.

1143
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,360
While thou livest, while it is in

1144
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,370
thy power, be good. How much trouble

1145
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,290
he avoids who does not look to see

1146
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,270
what his neighbor says, or does, or

1147
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,250
thinks, but only to what he does

1148
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,030
himself, that it may be just and pure,

1149
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,030
or as Agathon says, look not round at

1150
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,590
the end appraved, morals of others,

1151
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,750
but run straight along the line

1152
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,410
without deviating from it. You need to

1153
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,830
add some text for me to talk. He

1154
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,910
who has a vehement desire for

1155
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,210
posthumous fame does not consider

1156
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,010
that every one of those who remember

1157
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,530
him will himself also die very soon.

1158
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,530
But suppose that those who will

1159
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,890
remember are even immortal, and that

1160
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,960
the remembrance will be immortal. What

1161
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:50,720
then is this to thee? For thou now

1162
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,780
rejectest unseasonably the gift of

1163
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,320
nature, clinging to something else.

1164
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,910
Neither worse then nor better is a

1165
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,510
thing made by being praised. I affirm

1166
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,450
this also of the things which are

1167
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,850
called beautiful, by the vulgar, for

1168
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,470
example, material things and works of

1169
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:12,510
art. That which is really beautiful has

1170
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:14,670
no need of anything, not more than law,

1171
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,850
not more than truth, not more than

1172
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,310
benevolence or modesty. Which of these

1173
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,870
things is beautiful because it is

1174
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:23,290
praised, or spoiled by being blamed?

1175
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,950
Is such a thing as an emerald made

1176
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,990
worse than it was, if it is not

1177
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:35,700
praised? For as here, the mutation of

1178
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,280
these bodies, after a certain

1179
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,880
continuance, whatever it may be, and

1180
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,720
their dissolution make room for other

1181
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,200
dead bodies. So the souls which are

1182
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,260
removed into the air after subsisting

1183
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,440
for some time are transmuted and

1184
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,660
diffused. Nand assume a fiery nature by

1185
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,340
being received into the seminal

1186
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,440
intelligence of the universe. And in,

1187
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,760
this way, make room for the fresh

1188
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,040
souls which come to dwell there. If

1189
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,460
souls continue to exist, how does the

1190
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,600
air contain them from eternity? But how

1191
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,580
does the earth contain the bodies of

1192
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,680
those who have been buried from time

1193
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:18,810
so remote? But we must not only think

1194
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,890
of the number of bodies which are thus

1195
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,750
buried, but also of the number of

1196
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,650
animals which are daily eaten by us and

1197
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,490
the other animals. For what a number is

1198
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,850
consumed, and thus in a manner buried

1199
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,850
in the bodies of those who feed on

1200
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,030
them. And nevertheless, this earth

1201
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,730
receives them by reason of the

1202
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,730
changes of these bodies into blood,

1203
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,230
and the transformations into the

1204
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:48,800
or the fiery element, the division into

1205
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,780
that which is material and that which

1206
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,760
is the cause of form, the formal. Do

1207
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,920
not be worried about, but in every

1208
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,660
movement have respect to justice,

1209
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,540
and on the occasion of every

1210
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,540
impression maintain the faculty of

1211
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,980
comprehension or understanding.

1212
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,880
Everything harmonizes with me, which

1213
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,320
is harmonious to thee, O universe.

1214
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,620
Nothing for me is too early nor too

1215
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,020
late, which is in due time for thee.

1216
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,420
Everything is fruit to me which thy

1217
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,580
seasons bring, O nature. From thee are

1218
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,420
all things, in thee are all things, to

1219
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,720
thee all things return. The poet says,

1220
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,200
Dear city of set crops, and wilt not

1221
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,460
thou say, Dear city of Zeus, occupy

1222
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,420
thyself with few things, says the

1223
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,320
philosopher, if thou wouldst be

1224
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,800
tranquil. But consider, if it would

1225
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,120
not be better to say, Do what is

1226
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,900
necessary, and whatever the reason of

1227
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,680
the animal which is naturally social

1228
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,560
requires, and as it requires. For this

1229
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,620
brings not only the tranquility, which

1230
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,000
comes from doing well, but also that

1231
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,820
which comes from doing few things.

1232
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:01,630
Accordingly, on every occasion a man

1233
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,170
should ask himself, Is this one of

1234
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:11,700
the unnecessary things? Try how the

1235
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,160
life of the good man suits thee, the

1236
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,940
life of him who is satisfied with

1237
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,300
his portion out of the whole, and

1238
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,900
satisfied with his own, just acts and

1239
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:26,720
benevolent disposition. Look also at

1240
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,160
these. Do not disturb thyself. Make

1241
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:36,640
thyself all simplicity. In a word, thy

1242
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,440
life is short. Thou must turn to

1243
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,420
profit the present by the aid of

1244
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,480
reason and justice. But can a certain

1245
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,020
order subsist in thee, and disorder

1246
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,520
in thee all, and this too when all

1247
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,120
things are so separated and

1248
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:01,230
diffused and sympathetic? A black

1249
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,410
character, a womanish character, a

1250
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,730
stubborn character, bestial, childish,

1251
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,950
animal, stupid, counterfeit,

1252
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,330
scurrilous, fraudulent, tyrannical.

1253
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,450
If he is a stranger to the universe,

1254
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,450
who does not know what is in it, no

1255
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,190
less is he a stranger who does not

1256
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,470
know what is going on in it. He is

1257
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,490
a runaway, who flies from social

1258
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,190
reason. He is blind, who shuts the

1259
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,710
eyes of the understanding. He is poor,

1260
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,390
who has need of another, and has not

1261
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,530
from himself all things which are

1262
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:37,430
useful for life. He is an abscess on

1263
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,510
the universe, who withdraws and

1264
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,270
separates himself from the reason

1265
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,590
enough our common nature, through

1266
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,330
being displeased with the things

1267
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,780
which happen. For the same nature

1268
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,220
produces this, and has produced thee

1269
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,140
too. He is a piece rent asunder

1270
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,640
from the state, who tears his own

1271
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,580
soul from that of reasonable animals,

1272
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:00,120
which is one. The one is a

1273
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,360
philosopher, without a tunic, and

1274
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,780
the other, without a book. Here is

1275
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,780
another half-naked, bred, I have not,

1276
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,430
he says. And I abide by reason, and I

1277
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,390
do not get the means of living out

1278
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,850
of my learning, and I abide by my

1279
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,530
reason. Love the art, poor as it may

1280
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,050
be, which thou hast learned, and be

1281
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,970
content with it, and pass through

1282
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,890
the rest of life like one who has

1283
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,530
entrusted to the gods with his

1284
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,030
whole soul all that he has, making

1285
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,270
thyself neither the tyrant nor the

1286
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,550
slave of any man. Consider, for

1287
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,610
example, the times of Vespasian. Thou

1288
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,170
wilt see all these things, people

1289
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,710
marrying, bringing up children, sick,

1290
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,090
dying, warring, feasting, trafficking,

1291
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,890
cultivating the ground, flattering,

1292
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,270
obstinately arrogant, suspecting,

1293
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,870
plotting, wishing for some to die,

1294
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,490
grumbling about the present, loving,

1295
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,650
heaping of treasure, desiring

1296
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,270
counselship. Well then, that life of

1297
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,410
these people no longer exists at all,

1298
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,190
again, removed to the times of Trajan.

1299
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,890
Again, all is the same, their life too

1300
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:15,030
is gone. In like manner view also the

1301
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,910
other epochs of time and of whole

1302
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,130
nations, and see how many after great

1303
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,190
efforts soon fell and were resolved

1304
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,810
into the elements. But chiefly, thou

1305
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:26,090
shouldst think of those whom thou hast

1306
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,330
thyself known, distracting themselves

1307
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,930
about idle things, neglecting to do

1308
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,710
what was in accordance with their proper

1309
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,150
constitution, and to hold firmly to

1310
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,590
this, and to be content with it. For

1311
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,250
thus, thou wilt not be dissatisfied,

1312
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,910
if thou apply'st thyself to smaller

1313
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,630
matters no further than is fit. And

1314
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,250
the words which were formerly familiar

1315
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,690
are now antiquated, so also the names

1316
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,930
of those who were famed of old are now

1317
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:54,110
in a manner antiquated, Camillus,

1318
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:57,390
Cezo, Volasus, Leonidas, and a

1319
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:59,650
little after also Scipio and Cato,

1320
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:03,290
then Augustus, then. And herein it is

1321
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,950
necessary to remember that the

1322
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,050
attention given to everything has its

1323
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,190
proper value and proportion. For all

1324
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,350
things soon pass away and become a

1325
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:15,290
mere tale, and complete oblivion soon

1326
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,950
buries them. And I say this of those

1327
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,710
who have shown in a wondrous way,

1328
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,810
for the rest, as soon as they have

1329
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,550
breathed out their breath, they are

1330
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,850
gone, and no man speaks of them. And

1331
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:29,090
to conclude the matter, what is even

1332
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:32,030
an eternal remembrance, a mere nothing?

1333
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,610
What, then, is that about which we

1334
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,970
ought to employ our serious pains?

1335
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,180
Willingly give thyself up to Clotho,

1336
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,440
one of the fates, allowing her to

1337
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,320
spin thy thread into whatever thing

1338
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,760
she pleases. Everything is only for a

1339
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,420
day, both that which remembers and

1340
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,760
that which is remembered. Observe

1341
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,960
constantly that all things take place

1342
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,400
by change, and accustom thyself to

1343
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,880
consider that the nature of the

1344
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,420
universe loves nothing so much as to

1345
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,640
change the things which are and to

1346
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,420
make new things like them. For

1347
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,080
everything that exists is in a manner,

1348
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:16,450
the seed of that which will be. But

1349
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,930
thou art thinking only of seeds

1350
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,910
which are cast into the earth, or

1351
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:24,050
into a womb. But this is a very

1352
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,310
vulgar notion. Thou wilt soon die,

1353
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:30,210
and thou art not yet simple, not free

1354
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,330
from perturbations, nor without

1355
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,330
suspicion of being hurt by external

1356
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,820
things, nor kindly disposed. Towards

1357
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,660
all, nor dost thou yet place wisdom

1358
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,250
only in enacting justly. Examine men's

1359
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,450
ruling principles, even those of the

1360
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,830
wise, what kind of things they avoid,

1361
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:53,350
and what kind they pursue. What is

1362
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,150
evil to thee does not subsist in

1363
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,370
the ruling principle of another, nor

1364
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,930
yet in any turning and mutation of thy

1365
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:03,190
corporeal covering. Where is it then? It

1366
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,790
is in that part of thee in which

1367
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,910
subsists the power of forming opinions

1368
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,710
about evils. Let this power then not

1369
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:12,230
form such opinions, and all as well.

1370
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,510
And if that which is nearest to it,

1371
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,970
the poor body, is burnt, filled with

1372
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,970
matter and rottenness. Nevertheless,

1373
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,210
let the part which forms opinions

1374
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,710
about these things be quiet. That is,

1375
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,150
let it judge that nothing is either

1376
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,590
good, which can happen equally to the

1377
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:31,150
bad man and the good. You need to add

1378
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,730
some text for me to talk.

1379
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,390
Constantly regard the universe as

1380
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,950
one living being, having one substance

1381
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,390
and one soul, and observe how all

1382
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41,870
things have reference to one

1383
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,390
perception, the perception of this one

1384
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:47,150
living being, and how all things act

1385
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,470
with one movement, and how all things

1386
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,510
are the cooperating causes of all

1387
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:54,490
things which exist. Observe, too, the

1388
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,090
continuous spinning of thee. For that

1389
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,210
which happens equally, to him who

1390
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,050
lives contrary to nature, and to him

1391
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:06,480
who lives according to nature, is

1392
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,230
neither according to nature, nor

1393
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,710
contrary to nature.

1394
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,840
Soul-bearing about a corpse, as

1395
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,420
Epictetus used to say. It is no

1396
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,420
evil for things to undergo change,

1397
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,820
and no good for things to subsist

1398
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,520
in consequence of change. Time is like

1399
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,320
a river made up of the events which

1400
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,000
happen, and a violent stream, for as

1401
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,100
soon as a thing has been seen, it is

1402
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,420
carried away, and another comes in its

1403
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:42,780
place. Everything which happens is as

1404
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:45,940
familiar, and well known, as the

1405
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:56,530
rose in spring. For such is disease,

1406
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,510
death, and death, and calumny,

1407
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:02,830
treachery, or whatever else delights

1408
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,260
fools or vexes them. In this series

1409
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,960
of things, those which follow are

1410
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,200
always aptly fitted to those which

1411
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,930
have gone before. For this series is

1412
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,090
not like a mere enumeration of

1413
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,250
disjointed things, which has only a

1414
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,190
necessary sequence, but it is a

1415
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:36,500
rational connection. No mere

1416
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,660
succession, but a certain wonderful

1417
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,860
relationship. You need to add some

1418
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,660
text for me to talk, and think too

1419
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,640
of him who forgets wither the way

1420
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,500
leads, and that men quarrel with

1421
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,900
that with which they are most

1422
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,300
constantly in communion. The reason

1423
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,440
which governs the universe, and the

1424
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,200
things which daily meet with, seem to

1425
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,360
them strange, and consider that we

1426
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,640
ought not to act and speak as if we

1427
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,580
were asleep. For even in sleep we

1428
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,960
seem to act and speak, and that we

1429
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,000
ought not, like children who learn

1430
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,460
from their parents, simply to act and

1431
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,900
speak as we have been taught. Always

1432
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,920
remember the saying of Heraclitus,

1433
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,940
that the death of earth is to become

1434
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,380
water, and the death of water is to

1435
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:24,140
become air, and the death of air is to

1436
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:28,500
become fire. And reversely, if any God

1437
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,080
told thee that thou shalt die

1438
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,040
to-morrow, or certainly on the day

1439
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,860
after to-morrow, thou wouldst not

1440
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,240
care much whether it was on the

1441
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,640
third day, or on the morrow. Unless

1442
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,440
thou wast in the highest degree

1443
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,800
mean-spirited, for how small is the

1444
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,830
difference. Think continually how many

1445
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,450
physicians are dead, after often

1446
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:51,570
contracting their eyebrows over the

1447
01:11:51,570 --> 01:12:01,060
sick. Power over men's lives with

1448
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,140
terrible insolence, as if they were

1449
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,440
immortal, and how many cities are

1450
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,060
entirely dead, so to speak, Helis,

1451
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,480
and Pompeii, and Herculaneum, and

1452
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,280
others innumerable. So think it no

1453
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,260
great thing to die after as many

1454
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,260
years as thou canst name, rather

1455
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:23,700
than to-morrow. To conclude, always

1456
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,660
observe how ephemeral and worthless

1457
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,520
human things are, and what was

1458
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,220
yesterday a little mucus to. Morrow

1459
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,300
will be a mummy, or ashes. Pass then

1460
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,400
through this little space of time

1461
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,140
conformably to nature, and end thy

1462
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,000
journey in content, just as an olive

1463
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,220
falls off when it is ripe. Blessing

1464
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,540
nature who produced it. Be like the

1465
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,520
promontory against which the waves

1466
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,720
continually break, but it stands

1467
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,880
firm and tames the fury of the

1468
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,660
water around it. Unhappy am I, because

1469
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,540
this has happened to me. Not so, but

1470
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,560
happy am I, though this has happened

1471
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,540
to me, because I continue free from

1472
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,580
pain, neither crushed by the present,

1473
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,900
nor fearing the future. For such a

1474
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,440
thing as this might have happened to

1475
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,660
every man. But every man would not

1476
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,700
have continued free from pain on such

1477
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,310
an occasion. Why, then, is that

1478
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:24,530
rather a misfortune than this, a good

1479
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:29,390
fortune? And does a thing seem to thee

1480
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:31,670
to be a deviation from man's nature,

1481
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:34,270
when it is not contrary to the will of

1482
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,310
man's nature? Well, thou knowest the

1483
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:40,080
will of nature. Will then this which

1484
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,360
has happened prevent thee from being

1485
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,000
just, magnanimous, and temperate,

1486
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,680
prudent, secure against inconsiderate

1487
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,540
opinions and falsehood? Will it

1488
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,860
prevent thee from having modesty,

1489
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,260
freedom, and everything else, by the

1490
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,700
presence of which man's nature

1491
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,260
obtains all that is its own? Remember

1492
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,760
too, on every occasion, which leads

1493
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,220
thee to vexation, to apply this

1494
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,120
principle, not that this is a

1495
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,160
misfortune, but that to bear it

1496
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:13,170
nobly is good fortune. What more,

1497
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:15,730
then, have they gained than those who

1498
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:23,870
have died early? Altogether the

1499
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:26,230
interval is small between birth and

1500
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,430
death, and consider with how much

1501
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,650
trouble, and in company with what sort

1502
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:33,170
of people, and in what a feeble body

1503
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,570
this interval is laboriously passed.

1504
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,550
Do not then consider life a thing of

1505
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:41,230
any value, for look to the immensity of

1506
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,380
time behind thee, and to the time which

1507
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,340
is before thee, another boundless

1508
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:53,560
space. Always run to the short way,

1509
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,460
and the short way is the natural.

1510
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,640
Accordingly say and do everything in

1511
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,900
conformity with thee. For such a

1512
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,440
purpose frees a man from trouble and

1513
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,760
warfare in all artifice and

1514
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,280
ostentatious display.

1515
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,620
And art thou unwilling to do the work

1516
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,680
of a human being, and dost thou not

1517
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,360
make haste to do that which is

1518
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,820
according to thy nature? It is

1519
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,010
necessary, however. Nature has fixed

1520
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,270
bounds to this too. She has fixed

1521
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:02,210
bounds both to eating and drinking.

1522
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,880
Yet in thy acts it is not so, but

1523
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,640
thou stopest short of what thou

1524
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,000
canst do. So thou lovest not

1525
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,540
thyself, for if thou didst, thou

1526
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,240
wouldst love thy nature and her

1527
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,080
will. But those who love their

1528
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,760
several arts exhaust themselves in

1529
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,040
working at them, unwashed and

1530
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,860
without food, but thou valuest thy

1531
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,280
own nature. Less than the

1532
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,680
turner values the turning art, or

1533
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,800
the dancer, the dancing art, or the

1534
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,420
lover of money values his money, or

1535
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,380
the. And such men, when they have a

1536
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,920
violent affection to a thing, choose

1537
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,240
neither to eat nor to sleep, rather

1538
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,220
than to perfect the things which they

1539
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:57,230
care for. How easy it is to repel

1540
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:59,070
and to wipe away every impression

1541
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,670
which is troublesome or unsuitable.

1542
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,140
And judge every word and deed which

1543
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,920
are according to nature to be fit

1544
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,560
for thee, and be not diverted by the

1545
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,200
blame which follows, from any people

1546
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,460
nor by their words. But if a thing

1547
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,080
is good to be done or said, do not

1548
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,320
consider it unworthy of thee. For

1549
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,180
those persons have their peculiar

1550
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,180
leading principle, and follow their

1551
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,860
movement, which things do not thou

1552
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:28,400
regard, but go straight on following

1553
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,830
thy own nature. And the common

1554
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:34,550
nature in the way of both is one. I

1555
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,250
go through the things which happen

1556
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:40,620
according to nature, until I shall

1557
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:44,500
fall and rest, breathing out my

1558
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,440
breath into that element out of

1559
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,890
which I daily drawed in, and

1560
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,150
falling upon that earth out of which

1561
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,650
my father collected the seed and my

1562
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,910
mother, the blood and my nurse the

1563
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:06,340
milk. Drink, which bears me when I

1564
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,100
tread on it and abuse it for so

1565
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,020
many purposes, thou sayest, men

1566
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,880
cannot admire the sharpness of thy

1567
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,070
wit. Be it so, but there are many

1568
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,510
other things of which thou canst

1569
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:19,890
not say, I am not formed for them

1570
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,950
by nature. Show those qualities,

1571
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,210
then, which are altogether in thy

1572
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:28,650
power, sincerity, gravity, endurance

1573
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,790
of labour, aversion to pleasure,

1574
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,050
contentment with thy portion, and

1575
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:35,190
with few things, benevolence,

1576
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,930
frankness, no love of superfluity,

1577
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,390
freedom from trifling magnanimity.

1578
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,270
Dost thou not see how many

1579
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,150
qualities thou art immediately able

1580
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:47,150
to exhibit, in which there is no

1581
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,390
excuse of natural incapacity and

1582
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,410
unfitness, and yet thou still

1583
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,250
remainest voluntarily below the

1584
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,370
mark? Or art thou compelled through

1585
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,210
being defectively furnished by

1586
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:00,610
nature to murmur, and to be stingy,

1587
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,610
and to flatter, and to find fault

1588
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:05,050
with thy poor body, and to try to

1589
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,790
please men, and to make great

1590
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:09,110
display, and to be so restless in

1591
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,990
thy mind? No, by the gods, but

1592
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,470
thou mightest have been delivered

1593
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,130
from these things long ago, only

1594
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,610
if in truth thou canst be charged

1595
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:21,810
with being rather slow and dull of

1596
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:23,970
comprehension. Thou must exert

1597
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:26,450
thyself about this also, not

1598
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,390
neglecting it, nor yet taking

1599
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,990
pleasure in thy dullness. One man,

1600
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,510
when he has done a service to

1601
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,470
another, is ready to set it down

1602
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,030
to his account as a favor

1603
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:41,910
conferred. Another is not ready to do

1604
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,970
this, but still in his own mind he

1605
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,830
thinks of the man as his debtor,

1606
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:48,590
and he knows what he has done. A

1607
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,150
third in a manner does not even know

1608
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,290
what he has done, but he is like a

1609
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,210
vine which has produced grapes, and

1610
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,170
seeks for nothing more after it has

1611
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:58,690
once produced its proper fruit. As a

1612
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:05,710
vine, a man who has done a good

1613
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,950
service to another, does not call

1614
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:09,590
out for others to come and see.

1615
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:11,710
But he goes on to another act, as a

1616
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:13,610
vine goes on to produce again the

1617
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:16,270
grapes in season. Must a man then be

1618
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,310
one of these, who in a manner act

1619
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:23,840
thus without observing it? Yes. But

1620
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,620
this very thing is necessary, the

1621
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,540
observation of what a man is doing.

1622
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,780
For, it may be said, if a man

1623
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,920
It is characteristic of the social

1624
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,560
animal to perceive that he is

1625
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,780
working in a social manner, and

1626
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,780
indeed, to wish that his social

1627
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,540
partner also should perceive it.

1628
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,640
It is true what thou sayest,

1629
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,180
but thou dost not rightly

1630
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,000
understand what is now said.

1631
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,820
But if thou wilt choose to

1632
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,360
understand the meaning of what is

1633
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,840
said, do not fear that for this

1634
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,540
reason thou wilt omit any social

1635
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:06,260
act. A prayer of the Athenians

1636
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,920
Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on

1637
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,880
the plowed fields of the Athenians

1638
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,400
and on the plains. In truth, we

1639
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,080
ought not to pray at all, or we

1640
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,620
ought to pray in this simple and

1641
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,880
noble fashion. Just as we must

1642
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,580
understand, when it is said, that

1643
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,460
Aesculapius prescribed to this man

1644
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,140
horse exercise, or bathing in cold

1645
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,320
water, or going without shoes.

1646
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,840
So, we must understand it. When it

1647
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:44,250
said, for in the first case

1648
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,310
prescribed means something like

1649
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:49,170
this. He prescribed this for this

1650
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,430
man as a thing adapted to

1651
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,210
procure health, and in the

1652
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:55,530
second case it means that which

1653
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,150
happens to, or suits, every man

1654
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:00,130
is fixed in a manner for him

1655
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:01,970
suitably to his destiny.

1656
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,520
And four, this is what we mean

1657
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,040
when we say that things are

1658
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,020
suitable to us. As the

1659
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,120
Romans say of squared stones in

1660
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,220
walls, or the pyramids, that they

1661
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,420
are suitable, when they fit them

1662
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,980
to one another in some kind of

1663
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,840
connection. For there is all

1664
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,900
together, one fitness, harmony.

1665
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,280
And as the universe is made up

1666
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,980
out of all bodies to be such a

1667
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,300
body as it is, so out of all

1668
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,060
existing causes, necessity,

1669
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,760
destiny, is made up to be such a

1670
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,200
cause as it is. And even those

1671
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,380
who are completely ignorant

1672
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,220
understand what I mean, for they

1673
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:44,900
it, necessity, destiny, brought

1674
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:51,100
this to such a person. Many as a

1675
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,020
matter of course, even among his

1676
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,800
prescriptions, are disagreeable,

1677
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,040
but we accept them in the hope

1678
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:03,640
of health. And so accept

1679
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,020
everything which happens, even

1680
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,480
if it seemed disagreeable,

1681
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:09,400
because it leads to this, to

1682
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,140
the health of the universe, and

1683
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,000
to the prosperity and felicity

1684
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,540
of Zeus the universe. For he

1685
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,080
would not have brought on any

1686
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,720
man what he has brought, if it

1687
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,200
were not useful for the whole.

1688
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,320
You need to add some text for me

1689
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,840
to talk. For two reasons, then

1690
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,320
it is right to be content with

1691
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,460
that which happens to thee. The

1692
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,460
one, because it was done for

1693
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,340
thee, and prescribed for thee,

1694
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,320
and in a manner had reference

1695
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,560
to thee, originally from the

1696
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,640
most ancient causes spun with

1697
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,020
thy destiny, of and the

1698
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,960
other, because even that which

1699
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,120
comes severly to every man is

1700
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,840
to the power which administers

1701
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,820
the universe, a cause of

1702
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,080
felicity and perfection, nay

1703
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,120
even of its very continuance,

1704
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,160
neither does the nature of

1705
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,200
anything, whatever it may be,

1706
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,380
cause anything which is not

1707
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:01,880
suitable to that which is

1708
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,370
directed by it. For the

1709
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,330
integrity of the whole is

1710
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:08,830
mutilated, if thou cuttest

1711
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,610
off anything whatever, from

1712
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:11,930
the conjunction and the

1713
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:14,460
continuity, either of the

1714
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,380
parts or of the causes.

1715
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,500
You need to add some text for

1716
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,020
me to talk. Be not disgusted

1717
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,500
nor discouraged, nor

1718
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,820
dissatisfied, if thou dost not

1719
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,360
succeed in doing everything

1720
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,000
according to right principles.

1721
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,280
But when thou hast failed,

1722
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:38,090
return back again, master,

1723
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,830
but act like those who have

1724
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,550
sore eyes and apply a bit of

1725
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,610
sponge and egg, or as another

1726
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:45,430
applies a plaster, or

1727
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:47,190
drenching with water. And

1728
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,170
thou dost cut off, as far

1729
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,850
as it is in thy power, when

1730
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,950
thou art dissatisfied, yanned

1731
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,690
in a manner triest, to put

1732
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:57,120
anything out of the way. For

1733
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,640
thus thou wilt not fail to

1734
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,480
obey reason, and thou wilt

1735
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,500
repose in it. And remember

1736
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
that philosophy requires only

1737
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,880
the things which thy nature

1738
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,760
requires, but thou wouldst

1739
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,220
have something else which

1740
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,740
is not according to nature.

1741
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,940
For what is more agreeable

1742
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,680
than wisdom itself, when

1743
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,900
thou thinkest of the

1744
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,280
security and the happy

1745
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,940
course of all things which

1746
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,380
depend on the faculty of

1747
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,700
understanding and knowledge?

1748
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,520
Things are in such a kind of

1749
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,760
envelopment that they have

1750
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,680
seemed to philosophers, not a

1751
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,100
few, nor those common

1752
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,700
philosophers, altogether

1753
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,640
unintelligible, nay even to

1754
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,540
the Stoics. But is not this

1755
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:39,900
the very reason why pleasure

1756
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,000
deceives us? And consider

1757
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,700
if magnanimity, freedom,

1758
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,300
simplicity, equanimity,

1759
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,160
piety are not more agreeable,

1760
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,960
and all our assent is

1761
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,820
changeable. For where is the

1762
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,060
man who never changes?

1763
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,920
Carry thy thoughts, then to

1764
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,620
the objects themselves, and

1765
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,080
consider how short-lived they

1766
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,580
are, and worthless, and that

1767
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,500
they may be in the

1768
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,260
possession of a filthy wretch,

1769
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,280
or a whore, or a robber.

1770
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,360
Then turn to the morals of

1771
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,640
those who live with thee,

1772
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,580
and it is hardly possible

1773
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,300
to endure even the most

1774
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,580
agreeable of them, to say

1775
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,220
nothing of a man being

1776
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,160
hardly able. In such

1777
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,900
darkness, then, and dirt,

1778
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,980
and in so constant a and

1779
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,020
flux, both of substance and

1780
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,280
of time, and of motion,

1781
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,380
and of things moved, what

1782
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,440
there is worth being highly

1783
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,060
prized, or even an object

1784
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,040
of serious pursuit, I cannot

1785
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,330
imagine, that nothing

1786
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,050
will happen to me, which

1787
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,550
is not conformable to the

1788
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:44,510
nature of the universe, and

1789
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,610
the other, that it is in my

1790
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,510
power never to act contrary

1791
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:49,870
to my God and Daemon,

1792
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:52,650
about what am I now employing

1793
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:55,250
my own soul. On every

1794
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,770
occasion I must ask myself

1795
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,570
this question, and inquire,

1796
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,730
what have I now in this

1797
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,430
part of me, which they call

1798
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,730
the ruling principle, and

1799
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:06,690
whose soul have I now, that

1800
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:08,410
of a child, or of a young

1801
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,230
man, or of a feeble woman,

1802
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,310
or of a tyrant, or of a

1803
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,030
domestic animal, or of a

1804
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:19,980
wild beast? What kind of

1805
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,180
things those are which

1806
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,480
appear good to the many,

1807
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,980
we may learn even from

1808
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,320
this. For if any man should

1809
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,200
conceive certain things as

1810
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,020
being really good, such as

1811
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,400
prudence, temperance,

1812
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,780
justice, fortitude, he

1813
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,540
would not, after having

1814
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:36,940
first conceived these,

1815
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,280
endure to listen to

1816
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,880
anything which should not

1817
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,460
be in harmony with what

1818
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,120
is really good. But, if

1819
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,620
a man has first conceived

1820
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,400
as good the things which

1821
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,560
appear to the many to

1822
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,760
be good, he will listen,

1823
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,560
and readily receive, as

1824
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,180
very applicable, that which

1825
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,340
was said by the comic

1826
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:02,430
writer. Thus, even the

1827
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,430
many perceive the

1828
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:05,230
difference, for were it

1829
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,690
not so, this saying

1830
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,470
would not offend, and

1831
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:09,970
would not be rejected in

1832
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:11,550
the first case, while we

1833
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,610
receive it when it is

1834
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:14,370
said of wealth, and of

1835
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:15,510
the means which further

1836
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:18,090
luxury and fame, as said

1837
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,490
fitly and wittily. Go on,

1838
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:21,830
then, and ask if we

1839
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,010
should value and think

1840
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:24,470
those things to be good,

1841
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,190
to which, after their

1842
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:27,370
first conception in the

1843
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:28,490
mind, the words of the

1844
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:29,690
comic writer might be

1845
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:32,050
aptly applied, that he who

1846
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,470
has them, through pure

1847
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,050
abundance, has not a

1848
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,370
place to ease nymph-self

1849
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:40,220
in. I am composed of the

1850
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,400
formal and the material,

1851
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,700
and neither of them will

1852
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,120
perish into nonexistence,

1853
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,400
as neither of them came

1854
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,520
into existence out of

1855
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,360
nonexistence. Every part

1856
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,260
of me, then, will be

1857
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,620
reduced by change into

1858
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:52,360
some part of the

1859
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,520
universe, and that

1860
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,740
again will change into

1861
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,640
another part of the

1862
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,420
universe, and so on

1863
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,860
forever. And by

1864
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,040
consequence of such a

1865
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,860
change, I, too, exist,

1866
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:05,690
and those who begot me,

1867
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:07,410
and so on forever in the

1868
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,740
other direction. For

1869
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,020
nothing hinders us from

1870
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,440
saying so, even if the

1871
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,680
universe is administered

1872
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,700
according to definite

1873
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,880
periods of revolution.

1874
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,340
Reason and the reasoning

1875
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,260
art, philosophy, are

1876
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,220
powers which are

1877
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:21,860
sufficient for

1878
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:23,100
themselves and for

1879
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,760
their own works. They

1880
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,680
move, then, from a

1881
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,740
first principle which is

1882
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,220
their own, and they make

1883
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,540
their way to the end

1884
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:30,480
which is proposed to

1885
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,380
them. And this is the

1886
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,480
reason why such acts

1887
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,500
are named katorthasais,

1888
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,940
or right acts, which

1889
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,080
word signifies that

1890
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,000
they proceed. None of

1891
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,320
these things ought to be

1892
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,720
called a man's, which

1893
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,460
do not belong to a man,

1894
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:53,470
as man. Neither, then,

1895
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,470
does the end of man

1896
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,770
lie in these things,

1897
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:56,950
nor yet that which

1898
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:57,750
aids to the

1899
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:58,690
accomplishment of this

1900
01:29:58,690 --> 01:29:59,890
end, and that which

1901
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:01,290
aids towards this end,

1902
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,650
is that which is good.

1903
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:04,930
Besides, if any of these

1904
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:05,970
things did belong to

1905
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:07,090
man, it would not be

1906
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,110
right for a man to

1907
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:09,270
despise them and to

1908
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,090
set himself against

1909
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:11,630
them, nor would a man

1910
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,750
be worthy of praise,

1911
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:15,190
who showed that he did

1912
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:16,270
not want these things,

1913
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:17,690
nor would he who stinted

1914
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:18,730
himself in any of them

1915
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:20,110
be good, if indeed

1916
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:21,250
these things were good.

1917
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,830
But now the more of

1918
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:23,750
these things a man

1919
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,050
deprives himself of,

1920
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:26,330
or of other things

1921
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,710
like them, or even

1922
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,910
when he is deprived

1923
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:30,710
of any of them, the

1924
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:32,330
more patiently he endures

1925
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,190
the loss. Just in the

1926
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,670
same degree he is a

1927
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:38,350
better man. And, such as,

1928
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:39,550
are thy habitual

1929
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:41,250
thoughts. Such also

1930
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:42,250
will be the character

1931
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,230
of thy mind. For the

1932
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,230
soul is died by the

1933
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:49,870
thoughts. But he must

1934
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,430
live in a palace. Well,

1935
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:52,510
then, he can also

1936
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,570
live well in a palace.

1937
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:55,730
And again, consider

1938
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:56,630
that for whatever

1939
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,650
purpose each thing

1940
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:58,930
has been constituted,

1941
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,790
for this it has been

1942
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,490
constituted, and towards

1943
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,750
this it is carried,

1944
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,730
and its end is.

1945
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,360
Now the good for the

1946
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,540
reasonable animal is

1947
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,140
society. For that we

1948
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,280
are made for society

1949
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,560
has been shown above.

1950
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,780
Is it not plain that

1951
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,140
the inferior exist

1952
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,140
for the sake of the

1953
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,860
superior? But the

1954
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,000
things which have life

1955
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,320
are superior to those

1956
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,440
which have not life,

1957
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,380
and of those which

1958
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,500
have life, the

1959
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,620
superior are those

1960
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,360
which have reason.

1961
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,560
To seek what is

1962
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,800
impossible is madness,

1963
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,180
and it is impossible

1964
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:33,140
that the badge should

1965
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:33,980
not do something of

1966
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,640
this kind. Nothing

1967
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,820
happens to any man

1968
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,820
which he is not formed

1969
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,680
by nature to bear. The

1970
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,800
same things happen to

1971
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,700
another, and either

1972
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,780
because he does not see

1973
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:43,720
that they have happened,

1974
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,780
or because he would

1975
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:46,000
show a great spirit he

1976
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,080
is firm and remains

1977
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,880
unharmed. It is a

1978
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,820
shame, then, that

1979
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:50,820
ignorance and conceit

1980
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,560
should be stronger

1981
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,300
than wisdom. Things

1982
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,300
themselves touch. Not

1983
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,740
the soul, not in the

1984
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,080
least degree, nor have

1985
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,100
they admission to the

1986
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,440
soul, nor can they

1987
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,780
turn or move the

1988
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,320
soul. But the soul

1989
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,900
turns and moves itself

1990
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,360
alone, and whatever

1991
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,500
judgments it may think

1992
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,140
proper to make, such

1993
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,520
it makes for itself

1994
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,460
the things. In one

1995
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,060
respect, man is the

1996
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,340
nearest thing to me,

1997
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,940
so far as I must do

1998
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,480
good to men and endure

1999
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:24,070
them. You need to add

2000
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:25,250
some text for me to

2001
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,790
talk. Now it is true

2002
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:29,050
that these may impede

2003
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:30,590
my action, but they

2004
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:31,970
are no impediments to

2005
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,110
my affects and

2006
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:34,910
disposition, which have

2007
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:36,130
the power of acting

2008
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,470
conditionally and

2009
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,070
changing. For the

2010
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:40,570
mind converts and

2011
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,170
changes every hindrance

2012
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:43,570
to its activity into

2013
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,950
an aid, and so that

2014
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,030
which is a hindrance is

2015
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,150
made a furtherance to

2016
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:55,340
an act. Reverence that

2017
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,240
which is best in the

2018
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,900
universe, and this is

2019
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,880
that which makes use

2020
01:32:58,880 --> 01:32:59,980
of all things and

2021
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,780
directs all things. And

2022
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,940
in like manner also

2023
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:03,800
reverence that which

2024
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,300
is best in thyself,

2025
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,890
and this is of the

2026
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:08,010
same kind as that,

2027
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:09,850
for in thyself also,

2028
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,170
that which makes use

2029
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,730
of everything else is

2030
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:14,910
this, and thy life is

2031
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:20,790
directed by this. But

2032
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,990
if the state is harmed,

2033
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,610
thou must not be angry

2034
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:24,710
with him who does

2035
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:31,610
harm to the state. For

2036
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,890
substance is like a

2037
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,030
river in a continual

2038
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,070
flow, and the

2039
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,990
activities of things

2040
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,510
are in constant change,

2041
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,850
and the causes work

2042
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,090
in infinite varieties,

2043
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:41,110
and there is hardly

2044
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:42,170
anything which stands

2045
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:48,320
still. How then is

2046
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,760
he not a fool who is

2047
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,660
puffed up with such

2048
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,860
things, or plagued

2049
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:52,720
about them and makes

2050
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,620
himself miserable? For

2051
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:55,920
they vex him only for

2052
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,570
time, and a short time.

2053
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,940
I entink, of the

2054
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,060
universal substance,

2055
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,480
of which thou hast

2056
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,680
a very small portion,

2057
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,420
and of universal time,

2058
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,800
of which a short and

2059
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,700
indivisible interval

2060
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,660
has been assigned to

2061
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,280
thee, and of that

2062
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,160
which is fixed by

2063
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,420
destiny, and how small

2064
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,700
a part of it thou art.

2065
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,360
Does another do me

2066
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,800
wrong? Let him look

2067
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,400
to it. He has his

2068
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,240
own disposition,

2069
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,830
his own activity. I now

2070
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,710
have what the

2071
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:27,030
universal nature wills

2072
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,670
me to have, and I do

2073
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,850
what my nature now

2074
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:30,910
wills me to do.

2075
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,490
Let the part of thy

2076
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:33,390
soul which leads

2077
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:34,230
and governs be

2078
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,290
undisturbed by the

2079
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,370
movements in the flesh,

2080
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:37,410
whether of pleasure

2081
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:39,190
or of pain, and let

2082
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,430
it not unite with them,

2083
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,130
but let it circumscribe

2084
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,150
itself and limit

2085
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,350
those affects to their

2086
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,310
parts. But when these

2087
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:47,330
affects rise up to

2088
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:48,630
the mind, by virtue

2089
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:49,750
of that other sympathy,

2090
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,110
that naturally exists

2091
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:52,230
in a body which is

2092
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,940
all one, then thou

2093
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,020
must not strive to

2094
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,180
resist the sensation,

2095
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,940
for it is natural.

2096
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,690
But let not the

2097
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:01,730
ruling part of itself

2098
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,930
add to the sensation

2099
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,470
the opinion that it

2100
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:06,710
is either good or bad.

2101
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,820
Live with the gods.

2102
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:10,880
And he does live

2103
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,160
with the gods, who

2104
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,900
constantly shows to them.

2105
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,140
His own soul is

2106
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,480
satisfied with that

2107
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,800
which is assigned to him,

2108
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,170
and that it does

2109
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:20,990
all that the

2110
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:22,530
daemon wishes, which

2111
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,590
Zeus hath given to

2112
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:24,590
every man for his

2113
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:25,770
guardian and guide.

2114
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,500
A portion of himself.

2115
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,520
And this is every man's

2116
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,680
understanding and reason.

2117
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,160
Art thou angry with

2118
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,600
him whose armpits stink?

2119
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,200
Art thou angry with

2120
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:37,980
him whose mouth

2121
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:38,720
smells foul?

2122
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,040
What good will

2123
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,100
this anger do thee?

2124
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,920
He has such a mouth.

2125
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:44,580
He has such armpits.

2126
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,940
It is necessary that

2127
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:46,900
such an emanation

2128
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,280
must come from such things.

2129
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,820
But the man has reason,

2130
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,820
it will be said.

2131
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,300
And he is able,

2132
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,660
if I wish thee well

2133
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,600
of thy discovery.

2134
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:58,610
Well then,

2135
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,850
and thou hast reason,

2136
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,610
by thy rational faculty,

2137
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,770
stir up his rational faculty,

2138
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:05,310
show him his error,

2139
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:06,710
admonish him,

2140
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:07,970
for if he listens,

2141
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:09,430
thou wilt cure him,

2142
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:11,090
and there is no need of anger,

2143
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:13,050
as thou intendest to live

2144
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,270
when thou art gone out.

2145
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:15,970
So it is in thy

2146
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,330
power to live here.

2147
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,580
But if men do not permit thee,

2148
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,320
then get away out of life,

2149
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:23,580
yet so as if

2150
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,300
thou wert suffering no harm.

2151
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,820
Why dost thou think

2152
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,020
that this is any trouble?

2153
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,540
But so long as nothing of the kind

2154
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:36,600
drives me out,

2155
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,840
I remain, am free,

2156
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,060
and no man shall hinder me

2157
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,520
from doing what I choose.

2158
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,980
And I choose to do

2159
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,460
what is according to the nature

2160
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,520
of the rational and social animal.

2161
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,570
The intelligence of the universe

2162
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:52,310
is social.

2163
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:53,590
Accordingly,

2164
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,110
it has made the inferior things

2165
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:56,430
for the sake of the superior,

2166
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:57,510
and it has fitted

2167
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:58,870
the superior to one another.

2168
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,190
Thou seest how it has

2169
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:01,990
subordinated,

2170
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:03,090
coordinated,

2171
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:04,670
and assigned to everything

2172
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:05,810
its proper portion,

2173
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,190
and has brought together

2174
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,930
into concord with one another

2175
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:11,130
the things which are the best.

2176
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:13,770
How hast thou behaved hitherto

2177
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:15,650
to the gods, thy parents,

2178
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,930
brethren, children, teachers,

2179
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:20,670
to those who looked after thy infancy,

2180
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,730
to thy friends, kinsfolk,

2181
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,030
to thy slaves?

2182
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,020
You need to add some text

2183
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:29,980
for me to talk,

2184
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,080
and call to recollection

2185
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,480
both how many things

2186
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,800
thou hast passed through,

2187
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,160
and how many things

2188
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,760
thou hast been able to endure,

2189
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,860
and that the history of thy life

2190
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,060
is now complete,

2191
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:42,620
and thy service is ended,

2192
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,950
and how many beautiful things

2193
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:46,970
thou hast seen,

2194
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,310
and how many pleasures

2195
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:51,610
and pains thou hast despised,

2196
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:56,410
spurned,

2197
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:01,650
and to how many ill-minded folks

2198
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,510
thou hast shown a kind disposition.

2199
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,400
Why do unskilled

2200
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,120
and ignorant souls disturb him

2201
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,880
who has skill and knowledge?

2202
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:19,490
Soul then has skill and knowledge.

2203
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:26,670
Soon, very soon,

2204
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:29,250
thou wilt be ashes or a skeleton,

2205
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,650
and either a name or not even a name,

2206
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,770
but name is sound and echo,

2207
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,550
and the things which are much valued in life

2208
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:39,030
are empty and rotten and trifling,

2209
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:41,310
and like little dogs biting one another,

2210
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:42,870
and little children quarreling,

2211
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,950
laughing, and then straightway weeping.

2212
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:46,990
But fidelity and modesty

2213
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:48,450
and justice and truth

2214
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,090
are fled up to Olympus

2215
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,650
from the widespread earth.

2216
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:58,390
If the objects of sense are easily changed

2217
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:59,810
and never stand still,

2218
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:02,130
and the organs of perception are dull

2219
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,210
and easily receive false impressions,

2220
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,720
and the poor soul itself

2221
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,440
is an exhalation from blood,

2222
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,600
but to have good repute

2223
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,100
amidst such a world as this

2224
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,100
is an empty thing,

2225
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,670
why then dost thou not wait

2226
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:17,630
in tranquility for thy end,

2227
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:19,290
whether it is extinction

2228
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:21,070
or removal to another state?

2229
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:26,930
Why, what else than to venerate

2230
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:28,430
gods and bless them,

2231
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:29,950
and to do good to men,

2232
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,470
and to practice tolerance

2233
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:32,690
and self-restraint?

2234
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:34,760
But as to everything

2235
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,380
which is beyond the limits

2236
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:37,980
of the poor flesh and breath,

2237
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:41,080
to remember that this is neither thine

2238
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,400
nor in thy power.

2239
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,560
Thou canst pass thy life

2240
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,280
in an equable flow of happiness,

2241
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,940
if thou canst go by the right way

2242
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:51,120
and think and act in the right way.

2243
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,360
These two things are common,

2244
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,960
both to the soul of God

2245
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,360
and to the soul of man,

2246
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,760
and to the soul of every rational being,

2247
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,820
not to be hindered by another,

2248
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:03,030
and to hold good to consist

2249
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:04,810
in the disposition to justice,

2250
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,740
practice of it,

2251
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,960
and in this to let thy desire

2252
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,360
find its termination.

2253
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,920
If this is neither my own badness

2254
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,940
nor an effect of my own badness,

2255
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,200
and the common wheel is not injured,

2256
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,740
on why am I troubled about it?

2257
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,330
Do not be carried along inconsiderately

2258
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,610
by the appearance of things,

2259
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,090
but give help to all

2260
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,330
according to thy ability

2261
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:29,290
and their fitness,

2262
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:31,190
and if they should have sustained loss.

2263
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:33,690
In matters which are indifferent,

2264
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:36,210
do not imagine this to be a damage,

2265
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:37,810
for it is a bad habit.

2266
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,470
But as the old man, when he went away,

2267
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,590
asked back his foster child's top,

2268
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:44,470
remembering that it was a top,

2269
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:47,250
so do thou, in this case also.

2270
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,510
Yes, but they are objects

2271
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:55,230
of great concern to these people.

2272
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:57,550
Wilt thou too then be made a fool

2273
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:58,370
for these things?

2274
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:00,710
I was once a fortunate man,

2275
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:01,750
but I lost it,

2276
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,950
I know not how.

2277
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,540
But fortunate means that a man

2278
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,800
has assigned to himself a good fortune,

2279
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:09,020
and a good fortune

2280
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:11,100
is good disposition of the soul,

2281
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,460
good emotions, good actions.

2282
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,720
Book 6

2283
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,540
The substance of the universe

2284
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,360
is obedient and compliant,

2285
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,160
and the reason which governs it

2286
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:23,140
has in itself no cause for doing evil,

2287
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,960
for it has no malice,

2288
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,980
nor does it do evil to anything,

2289
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,440
nor is anything harmed by it.

2290
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:31,860
But all things are made and perfected

2291
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,980
according to this reason.

2292
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,300
Let it make no difference to thee

2293
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,160
whether thou art cold or warm,

2294
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,640
if thou art doing thy duty,

2295
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,660
and whether thou art drowsy

2296
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,300
or satisfied with sleep,

2297
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,350
and whether ill-spoken of

2298
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,350
or praised.

2299
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,660
For it is one of the acts of life,

2300
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,480
this act by which we die,

2301
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,440
it is sufficient then,

2302
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,920
in this act also,

2303
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,940
to do well what we have in hand.

2304
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:00,130
Look within,

2305
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,520
and all existing things soon change,

2306
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,960
and they will either be reduced to vapor,

2307
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,600
if indeed all substance is one,

2308
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,460
or they will be dispersed.

2309
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,780
The reason which governs

2310
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:18,860
knows what its own disposition is

2311
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,760
and what it does

2312
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,540
and on what material it works.

2313
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,960
The best way of avenging thyself

2314
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,080
is not to become like the wrong-doer.

2315
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,360
Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it

2316
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,240
in passing from one social act

2317
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,160
to another social act,

2318
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:36,140
thinking of God.

2319
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,860
The ruling principle

2320
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,600
is that which rouses and turns itself,

2321
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,020
and while it makes itself such as it is

2322
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,700
and such as it wills to be,

2323
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,580
it also makes everything which.

2324
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,540
You need to add some text for me to talk.

2325
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:52,540
In conformity to the nature of the universe

2326
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,340
every single thing is accomplished,

2327
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,980
for certainly it is not in conformity

2328
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:58,160
to any other nature

2329
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,960
that each thing is accomplished,

2330
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,340
either a nature which externally comprehends this

2331
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,340
or a nature which is comprehended

2332
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,360
within this nature,

2333
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,320
or a nature external,

2334
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,520
and independent of this.

2335
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,020
The universe is either a confusion

2336
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,340
and a mutual involution of things

2337
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:16,860
and a dispersion,

2338
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,260
or it is unity and order and providence.

2339
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,960
If, then, it is the former,

2340
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,000
why do I desire to tarry

2341
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,120
in a fortuitous combination of things

2342
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,280
and such a disorder?

2343
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,100
And why do I care about anything else

2344
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,440
than how I shall at last become earth?

2345
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:41,710
A now has been compelled by circumstances

2346
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:43,610
to be disturbed in a manner.

2347
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,420
Quickly return to thyself,

2348
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,480
and do not continue out of tune

2349
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,540
longer than the compulsion lasts,

2350
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,400
for thou wilt have more mastery

2351
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,300
over the harmony

2352
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,620
by continually recurring to it.

2353
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,780
If thou hadst a stepmother

2354
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,680
and a mother at the same time,

2355
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:04,440
thou wouldst be dutiful to thy stepmother,

2356
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,640
but still thou wouldst

2357
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,420
constantly return to thy mother.

2358
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,150
Let the court and philosophy

2359
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:12,410
now be to thee step.

2360
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:15,070
Mother and mother return to philosophy

2361
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:16,910
frequently and repose in her

2362
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:19,070
through whom what thou meetest with

2363
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:21,630
in the court appears to thee tolerable,

2364
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:24,330
and thou appearst tolerable in the court.

2365
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,490
You need to add some text for me to talk.

2366
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:31,890
When we have meat before us,

2367
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:33,190
and such eatables,

2368
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:34,970
we receive the impression

2369
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:37,750
that this is the dead body of a fish,

2370
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,810
and this is the dead body

2371
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:41,710
of a bird or of a pig.

2372
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:50,800
And again, things themselves

2373
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,100
and penetrate them,

2374
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,680
and so we see what kind of things they are.

2375
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:57,490
Just in the same way ought we to act

2376
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:58,850
all through life,

2377
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,310
and where there are things

2378
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:02,890
which appear most worthy of our approbation,

2379
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:04,850
we ought to lay them bare

2380
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,690
and look at their worthlessness,

2381
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:08,870
and strip them of all the words

2382
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,330
by which they are exalted.

2383
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:11,950
For outward show

2384
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:14,230
is a wonderful perverter of the reason,

2385
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:16,090
and when thou art most sure

2386
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:17,170
that thou art employed

2387
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:18,830
about things worth thy pains,

2388
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:21,970
it is then that it cheats thee most.

2389
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,200
Consider then what Crait says

2390
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,620
of Xenocrates himself.

2391
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,400
Most of the things which the multitude admire

2392
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,940
are referred to objects

2393
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:34,400
of the most general kind,

2394
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,000
those which are held together

2395
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,320
by cohesion or natural organization,

2396
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,220
such as stones, wood,

2397
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,400
fig-trees, vines, olives.

2398
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,600
But those which are admired by men

2399
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,140
who are a little more reasonable

2400
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:47,600
are referred to the things

2401
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,480
which are held together

2402
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,720
by a living principle,

2403
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,840
as flocks, herds.

2404
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,320
Those which are admired by men

2405
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,220
who are still more instructed

2406
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,460
are the things which are held together

2407
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:59,760
by a rational soul,

2408
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:02,080
not, however, a universal soul,

2409
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:04,960
but rational so far as it is a soul,

2410
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,080
skilled in some art,

2411
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,880
or expert in some other way,

2412
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,220
or simply rational

2413
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,800
so far as it possesses

2414
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,840
a number of slaves.

2415
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,020
You need to add some text

2416
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:15,940
for me to talk.

2417
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,080
But he who values rational soul,

2418
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,740
a soul universal

2419
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,720
and fitted for political life,

2420
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,080
regards nothing else except this.

2421
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,760
And above all things,

2422
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,740
he keeps his soul in a condition

2423
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,300
and in an activity,

2424
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:33,220
conformable to reason and social life.

2425
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:35,730
And he cooperates to this end

2426
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:37,790
with those who are of the same kind

2427
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:38,530
as himself.

2428
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,880
Some things are hurrying into existence,

2429
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,320
and others are hurrying out of it.

2430
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:47,400
And of that which is coming into existence,

2431
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,580
part is already extinguished

2432
01:46:50,580 --> 01:47:00,670
in this flowing stream then

2433
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:02,410
on which there is no abiding

2434
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:03,790
what is there of the things

2435
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:04,810
which hurry by

2436
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:07,110
on which a man would set a high price.

2437
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,940
It would be just as if a man

2438
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,920
should fall in love

2439
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,080
with one of the sparrows

2440
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,200
which fly by.

2441
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,000
Something of this kind

2442
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,760
is the very life of every man,

2443
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,440
like the exhalation of the blood

2444
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,240
and the respiration of the air.

2445
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,280
For such as it is,

2446
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:26,600
to have once drawn in the air,

2447
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,180
and to have given it back,

2448
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,460
which we do every moment.

2449
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:34,780
Just the same is it

2450
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:37,080
with the whole respiratory power

2451
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,820
which thou didst receive

2452
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,340
at thy birth yesterday

2453
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,600
and the day before,

2454
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,840
it back to the element

2455
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,620
from which thou didst first draw it.

2456
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:50,120
You need to add some text

2457
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,020
for me to talk.

2458
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,580
Neither is transpiration,

2459
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:54,800
as in plants,

2460
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:56,260
a thing to be valued,

2461
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,120
nor respiration,

2462
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,240
as in domesticated animals

2463
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,520
and wild beasts,

2464
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,020
nor the receiving of impressions

2465
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,740
by the appearances of things,

2466
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,320
nor being moved by desires

2467
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,020
as puppets by strings,

2468
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,460
nor assembling in herds,

2469
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,040
nor in being nourished by food.

2470
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,180
For this is just like

2471
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,080
the act of separating and parting.

2472
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,540
What then is worth being valued?

2473
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:24,800
To be received with clapping of hands.

2474
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:33,300
Neither must we value

2475
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,560
the clapping of tongues

2476
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,440
for the praise which comes from the many

2477
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,860
is a clapping of tongues.

2478
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,590
This, in my opinion,

2479
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,150
to move thyself

2480
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:44,450
and to restrain thyself

2481
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:46,730
in conformity to thy proper constitution,

2482
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:49,270
to which end both all employments

2483
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:50,330
and arts lead.

2484
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:52,350
For every art aims at this,

2485
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:54,170
that the thing which has been made

2486
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:55,530
should be adapted to the work

2487
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:56,790
for which it has been made,

2488
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:58,390
and both the vine-planter

2489
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:59,630
who looks after the vine

2490
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:00,810
and the horse-breaker.

2491
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,250
But the education

2492
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:03,630
and the teaching of youth

2493
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:04,650
aim at something.

2494
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:08,220
In this, then,

2495
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,120
is the value of the education

2496
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,120
and the teaching.

2497
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,660
Then thou wilt be neither free

2498
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:16,660
nor sufficient

2499
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,260
for thy own happiness,

2500
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:19,820
nor without passion.

2501
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:21,770
For of necessity

2502
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:23,370
thou must be envious,

2503
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:23,990
jealous,

2504
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:25,590
and suspicious of those

2505
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:27,110
who can take away those things

2506
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:28,690
and plot against those

2507
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:31,090
who have that which is valued by thee.

2508
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:33,030
Of necessity

2509
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:35,410
a man must be altogether

2510
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:37,550
in a state of perturbation

2511
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:39,450
who wants any of these things,

2512
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:40,530
and besides,

2513
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:43,070
he must often find fault with the gods.

2514
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:46,360
But to reverence and honor thy own mind

2515
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:48,200
will make thee content with thyself

2516
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,680
and in harmony with society

2517
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,220
and in agreement with the gods,

2518
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:53,380
that is, praising all that they give

2519
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,120
and have ordered.

2520
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,100
Above, below, all around

2521
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,600
are the movements of the elements.

2522
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,960
But the motion of virtue

2523
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,080
is in none of these.

2524
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:05,020
It is something more divine,

2525
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,600
and advancing by a way

2526
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,560
hardly observed,

2527
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,400
it goes happily on its road,

2528
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,820
how strangely men act.

2529
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,420
They will not praise those

2530
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:15,840
who are living at the same time

2531
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,680
and living with and themselves.

2532
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,520
But to be themselves,

2533
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:28,800
but to be themselves

2534
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:30,950
praised by posterity,

2535
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,210
by those whom they have never seen

2536
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,430
or ever will see,

2537
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:36,830
this they set much value on.

2538
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,080
But this is very much the same

2539
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:40,920
as if thou shouldest be grieved

2540
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,980
because those who have lived before thee

2541
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,480
did not praise thee.

2542
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,280
If a thing is difficult

2543
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,880
to be accomplished by thyself,

2544
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,520
do not think that it is impossible for man.

2545
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,900
But if anything is possible for man

2546
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,700
and conformable to his nature,

2547
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,500
think that this can be attained

2548
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,600
by thyself too.

2549
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,660
In the gymnastic exercises

2550
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:01,460
suppose that a man has torn thee

2551
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:02,240
with his nails

2552
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,160
and by dashing against thy head

2553
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,260
has inflicted a wound.

2554
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:07,790
Well, we neither show

2555
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:09,390
any signs of vexation,

2556
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:10,630
nor are we offended,

2557
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:12,930
nor do we suspect him afterwards

2558
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,250
as a treacherous fellow.

2559
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,100
And yet we are on our guard against him,

2560
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:19,980
not however as an enemy,

2561
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,500
nor yet with suspicion.

2562
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,520
But something like this,

2563
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:26,120
let thy behavior be

2564
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,860
in all the other parts of life.

2565
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,080
Let us overlook many things

2566
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,640
in those who are like

2567
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,340
antagonists in the gymnasium.

2568
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,560
For it is in our power, as I said,

2569
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,820
to get out of the way

2570
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:39,640
and to have no suspicion nor hatred.

2571
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:42,640
If any man is able to convince me

2572
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,380
and show me that I do not think

2573
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,300
or act right,

2574
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,940
I will gladly change,

2575
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,380
for I seek the truth

2576
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:50,580
by which no man was ever injured.

2577
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,440
But he is injured who abides

2578
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,000
in his error and ignorance.

2579
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,740
I do my duty,

2580
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,540
other things trouble me not,

2581
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,740
for they are either things without life

2582
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,260
or things without reason

2583
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:07,020
or things that have rambled

2584
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,480
and know not the way.

2585
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,220
As to the animals which have no reason

2586
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:13,380
and generally all things and objects,

2587
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:16,020
do thou, since thou hast reason

2588
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,000
and they have none,

2589
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,420
make use of them

2590
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:20,900
with an ingenuous and liberal spirit,

2591
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:22,600
but towards human beings,

2592
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,240
as they have reason,

2593
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,320
behave in a social spirit.

2594
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,150
Alexander the Macedonian

2595
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:33,510
and his groom by death

2596
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:35,210
were brought to the same state,

2597
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,090
for either they were received

2598
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:38,810
among the same seminal principles

2599
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:39,690
of the universe,

2600
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:41,910
or they were alike dispersed

2601
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:42,790
among the atoms.

2602
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,290
Consider how many things

2603
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:47,230
in the same indivisible time

2604
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:49,150
take place in each of us.

2605
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:52,390
Things which concern the body

2606
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,170
and things which concern the soul.

2607
01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:58,990
If any man should propose to thee

2608
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:01,490
the question how the name Antoninus

2609
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:02,090
is written,

2610
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:03,810
wouldst thou with the straining

2611
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:05,590
of the voice utter each letter?

2612
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:08,390
What then, if they grow angry,

2613
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:10,430
wilt thou be angry too?

2614
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:13,250
Wilt thou not go on with composure

2615
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,590
and number every letter?

2616
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:17,190
Just so, then in this life

2617
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:19,470
also remember that every duty

2618
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:21,270
is made up of certain parts.

2619
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:24,770
These it is thy duty to observe

2620
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,530
and without being disturbed

2621
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:28,190
or showing anger towards

2622
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:29,970
those who are angry with thee

2623
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,550
to go on thy way

2624
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:34,250
and finish that which is set before thee.

2625
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:37,230
How cruel it is not to allow men

2626
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:38,650
to strive after the things

2627
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:39,770
which appear to them

2628
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:41,890
to be suitable to their nature

2629
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:42,810
and profitable.

2630
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,190
For they are certainly moved

2631
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:48,850
towards things because they suppose

2632
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,490
them to be suitable to their nature

2633
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:52,170
and profitable to them.

2634
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:55,390
But knit is not so.

2635
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,930
Teach them then

2636
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58,670
and show them without being angry.

2637
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:01,710
Death is a cessation of the impressions

2638
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:02,650
through the senses

2639
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:04,550
and of the pulling of the strings

2640
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:06,090
which move the appetites

2641
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:07,630
and of the discursive movements.

2642
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:10,930
It is a shame for the soul to be first

2643
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:13,090
to give way in this life

2644
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:15,950
when thy body does not give way.

2645
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,040
Take care that thou art not made

2646
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,020
into a Caesar,

2647
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,820
that thou art not died with this die,

2648
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,500
for such things happen.

2649
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,140
Keep thyself then simple,

2650
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,740
good, pure, serious,

2651
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,630
free from affectation.

2652
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,740
You need to add some text for me to talk.

2653
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,900
Remember his constancy in every act

2654
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,820
which was conformable to reason

2655
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,980
and his evenness in all things

2656
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,260
and his piety

2657
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:55,720
and the serenity of his countenance

2658
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,800
and his sweetness

2659
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:59,620
and his disregard of empty fame

2660
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,400
and his efforts to understand things

2661
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,940
and how he would never let anything pass

2662
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,140
without having first

2663
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:08,320
most carefully examined it

2664
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,020
and clearly.

2665
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:12,000
You need to add some text for me to talk.

2666
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,540
Understood it

2667
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,200
and how he bore with those

2668
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,740
who blamed him unjustly

2669
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,400
without blaming them in return,

2670
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:20,540
how he did nothing in a hurry

2671
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:22,820
and how he listened not to Calamnes

2672
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,760
and how exact an examiner

2673
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,660
of manners and actions he was.

2674
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,740
And patient and how he was able

2675
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,660
on account of his sparing diet

2676
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,380
to hold out to the evening.

2677
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:41,690
Opinions and the pleasure that he had

2678
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:43,810
when any man showed him anything better

2679
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,980
and how religious he was

2680
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,040
without superstition.

2681
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,120
Reverence the gods and help men.

2682
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,140
Short is life.

2683
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,480
Return to thy sober senses

2684
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,320
and call thyself back.

2685
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:04,560
I consist of a little body

2686
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:05,540
and a soul.

2687
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,520
Now to this little body

2688
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,920
all things are indifferent

2689
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,560
for it is not able to perceive differences.

2690
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,100
But whatever things are

2691
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,760
the works of its own activity

2692
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,900
all these are in its power.

2693
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,030
And of these however

2694
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:24,390
only those which are done

2695
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:25,750
with reference to the present

2696
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:27,250
for as to the future

2697
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:29,170
and the past activities of the mind

2698
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:31,410
even these are for the present

2699
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,090
indifferent.

2700
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:34,830
Neither the labor which the hand does

2701
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,010
nor that of the foot

2702
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:37,530
is contrary to nature.

2703
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:40,250
So long as the foot does the foot's work

2704
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,970
and the hand the hands.

2705
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,100
So then neither to a man as a man

2706
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:46,960
is his labor.

2707
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:48,820
Contrary to nature.

2708
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,580
So long as it does the things of a man

2709
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:53,560
but if the labor is not contrary

2710
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,340
to his nature

2711
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:56,530
neither is it an evil to him.

2712
01:57:02,050 --> 01:57:04,310
Dost thou not see how the handy craftsmen

2713
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:05,310
accommodate themselves

2714
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:06,790
up to a certain point to those

2715
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:08,650
who are not skilled in their craft.

2716
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:11,270
Nevertheless they cling to the reason

2717
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,870
the principles of their art.

2718
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:15,410
Is it not strange if the architect

2719
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:17,210
and the physician shall have more respect

2720
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:17,890
to the reason

2721
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:19,810
the principles of their own arts

2722
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:21,650
than man to his own reason

2723
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:25,260
which is common to him and the gods.

2724
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:28,470
Asia, Europe are corners of the universe

2725
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:30,970
all the sea a drop in the universe

2726
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:33,230
ethos a little clod of the universe

2727
01:57:33,230 --> 01:57:36,070
all the present time is a point in eternity.

2728
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:39,330
All things are little changeable perishable

2729
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:41,910
all things come from thence

2730
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:43,710
from that universal ruling power

2731
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:45,070
either directly proceeding

2732
01:57:45,070 --> 01:57:46,590
or by way of sequence.

2733
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:49,290
And accordingly the lion's gaping jaws

2734
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:50,970
and that which is poisonous

2735
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:52,450
and every harmful thing

2736
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:54,030
as a thorn as mud

2737
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:56,490
are after products of the grand and beautiful.

2738
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:58,270
Do not then imagine

2739
01:57:58,270 --> 01:58:00,050
that they are of another kind

2740
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:02,010
from that which thou dost venerate

2741
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:03,530
but form a just opinion

2742
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,830
of the source of all.

2743
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,390
He who has seen present things

2744
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:08,410
has seen all

2745
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:09,590
both everything

2746
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:11,590
which has taken place from all eternity

2747
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,590
and everything

2748
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:14,870
which will be for time without end.

2749
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:17,670
For all things are of one kin

2750
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:18,730
and of one form.

2751
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:20,790
Frequently consider the connection

2752
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:22,270
of all things in the universe

2753
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:23,850
and their relation to one another.

2754
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:25,830
For in a manner all things

2755
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:27,330
are implicated with one another

2756
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:28,830
and all in this way

2757
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,190
are friendly to one another.

2758
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:32,830
For one thing comes in order after another

2759
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,090
and this is by virtue

2760
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:35,230
of the act of movement

2761
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:36,770
and mutual conspiration

2762
01:58:36,770 --> 01:58:38,190
and the unity of thee.

2763
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:40,350
Adapt thyself to the things

2764
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,290
with which thy lot has been cast

2765
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:43,930
and the man among whom

2766
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,590
thou hast received thy portion.

2767
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:48,970
Love them but do it truly, sincerely.

2768
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:54,170
Every instrument, tool, vessel,

2769
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,080
vessel, if it does that

2770
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,520
for which it has been made, is well.

2771
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:02,230
But in the things which are held

2772
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:03,690
and together by nature

2773
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:05,470
there is within

2774
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,160
and there abides in them

2775
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:10,160
the power which made them.

2776
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:12,460
Wherefore the more is it fit

2777
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:14,020
to reverence this power

2778
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:16,060
and to think that

2779
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:18,580
if thou dost live and act

2780
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:19,840
according to its will,

2781
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,040
everything in thee

2782
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,320
is in conformity to intelligence.

2783
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,240
You need to add some text

2784
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:28,120
for me to talk.

2785
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:29,680
Whatever of the things

2786
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:31,540
which are not within thy power

2787
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,920
thou shalt suppose to be good for thee

2788
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:34,700
or evil.

2789
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,600
It must of necessity be that.

2790
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:40,350
If such a bad thing befall thee

2791
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,290
or the loss of such a good thing

2792
01:59:42,290 --> 01:59:44,010
thou wilt blame the gods

2793
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:45,970
and hate men too.

2794
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:47,590
Those who are the cause

2795
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:49,350
of the misfortune or the loss

2796
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:51,070
or those who are suspected

2797
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:53,470
of being likely to be the cause.

2798
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:56,390
And indeed we do much injustice

2799
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:58,110
because we make a difference

2800
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,450
between these things.

2801
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:01,430
And thus also in the universe

2802
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:03,190
the things which belong to it

2803
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:05,150
are in conformity to intelligence.

2804
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:09,360
But if we judge only those things

2805
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,400
which are in our power

2806
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,760
to be good or bad

2807
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:14,250
there remains no reason

2808
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:16,230
either for finding fault with God

2809
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:19,070
or standing in a hostile attitude to man.

2810
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:21,550
We are all working together

2811
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,470
to one end,

2812
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,250
some with knowledge and design

2813
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,850
and others without knowing

2814
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:26,630
what they do.

2815
02:00:27,550 --> 02:00:29,730
As men also when they are asleep

2816
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:32,770
of whom it is Heraclitus I think

2817
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,950
who says that they are

2818
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:35,250
laborers and cooperators

2819
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:36,670
in the things which take place

2820
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:37,470
in the universe.

2821
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,890
But men cooperate

2822
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:42,690
after different fashions

2823
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:45,550
and even those cooperate abundantly.

2824
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,140
Who find fault with what happens

2825
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,080
and those who try to oppose it

2826
02:00:52,190 --> 02:00:53,490
and to hinder it.

2827
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,610
For the universe had need

2828
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,240
even of such man as these.

2829
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,260
It remains then for thee to understand

2830
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,140
among what kind of workman

2831
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:04,520
thou places thyself.

2832
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:06,840
For he who rules all things

2833
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,900
will certainly make a right use of thee

2834
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,540
and he will receive thee

2835
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,180
among some part of the co.

2836
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:17,720
But be not thou such a part

2837
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,460
as the mean and ridiculous verse

2838
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,200
in the play

2839
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,060
which Chrysippus speaks of.

2840
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:25,240
And does the sun undertake

2841
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,460
to do the work of the rain?

2842
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:30,360
Or Isculapius the work

2843
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,220
of the fruit bearer, the earth?

2844
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:34,420
And how is it with respect

2845
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:35,400
to each of the stars?

2846
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:36,840
Are they not different

2847
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,120
and yet they work together

2848
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:39,060
to the same end?

2849
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,960
If the gods have determined about me

2850
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,220
and about the things

2851
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,760
which must happen to me

2852
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,360
they have determined well.

2853
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:48,180
For it is not easy even

2854
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,180
to imagine a deity

2855
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,260
without forethought.

2856
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,440
And as to doing me harm

2857
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:54,500
why should they have any desire?

2858
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,300
For what advantage would result to them

2859
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:59,300
from this or to the whole

2860
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,180
which is the special object

2861
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:02,180
of their providence?

2862
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:04,420
But if they have not

2863
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,120
determined about me individually

2864
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,100
they have certainly determined

2865
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,900
about the whole at least.

2866
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:11,700
And the things which happen

2867
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:12,760
by way of sequence

2868
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,200
in this general arrangement

2869
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,580
I ought to accept

2870
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,620
with pleasure and to be.

2871
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,440
You need to add some text

2872
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,360
for me to talk.

2873
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,240
But if they determine

2874
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:22,980
about nothing

2875
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:24,940
which it is wicked to believe

2876
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:26,780
or if we do believe it

2877
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:28,280
let us neither sacrifice

2878
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,580
nor pray nor swear by them

2879
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:32,240
nor do anything else

2880
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,220
which we do

2881
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,940
as if the gods were present

2882
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,200
and lived with us.

2883
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,480
But if however the gods determine

2884
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,560
about none of the things

2885
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,660
which concern us

2886
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:42,120
I am able to determine

2887
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:43,080
about myself

2888
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,340
and I can.

2889
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,260
Inquire about that

2890
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,040
which is useful

2891
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,000
and that is useful to every man

2892
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,180
which is conformable

2893
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,980
to his own constitution and nature.

2894
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,220
But my nature is rational

2895
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,080
and social

2896
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,040
and my city and country

2897
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,660
so far as I am Antoninus

2898
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:00,480
is Rome.

2899
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:02,540
But so far as I am a man

2900
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:04,900
it is the world.

2901
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:09,530
The things then

2902
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:11,010
which are useful to these cities

2903
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:12,710
are alone useful to me.

2904
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,080
Whatever happens to every man

2905
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:16,300
this is for the interest

2906
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:17,260
of the universal

2907
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:18,600
this might be sufficient.

2908
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,590
But further thou wilt

2909
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:21,850
observe this also

2910
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:23,190
as a general truth.

2911
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:25,250
If thou dost observe

2912
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:27,070
that whatever is profitable

2913
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:27,990
to any man

2914
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:29,390
is profitable also

2915
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:30,370
to other men.

2916
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:31,930
But let the word profitable

2917
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:32,930
be taken here

2918
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:34,170
in the common sense

2919
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:34,850
as said

2920
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:36,510
of things of the middle kind

2921
02:03:36,510 --> 02:03:38,710
neither good nor bad.

2922
02:03:39,610 --> 02:03:41,510
As it happens to thee

2923
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:42,670
in the amphitheatre

2924
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,710
and such places

2925
02:03:43,710 --> 02:03:45,130
that the continual sight

2926
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:46,250
of the same things

2927
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:47,290
and the uniformity

2928
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:48,930
make the spectacle wearisome

2929
02:03:48,930 --> 02:03:50,990
so it is in the whole of life

2930
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:52,690
for all things above

2931
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:54,290
below are the same.

2932
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:55,850
How long then?

2933
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:57,290
Think continually

2934
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:59,010
that all kinds of men

2935
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:00,850
and of all kinds of pursuits

2936
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:02,770
and of all nations are dead

2937
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:05,390
so that thy thoughts come down

2938
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:07,230
even to Philistian

2939
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:09,510
and Phoebus

2940
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:11,150
and Oregonian.

2941
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:13,530
Now turn thy thoughts

2942
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:15,050
to the other kinds of men.

2943
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:16,730
You need to add some text

2944
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:17,790
for me to talk.

2945
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:19,370
To that place then

2946
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,450
we must remove

2947
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:21,870
where there are so many

2948
02:04:21,870 --> 02:04:22,810
great orators

2949
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:25,110
and so many noble philosophers

2950
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:26,610
Heraclitus

2951
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:27,310
Pythagoras

2952
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:28,810
Socrates

2953
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:30,250
so many heroes

2954
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,330
of former days

2955
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:32,910
and so many generals

2956
02:04:32,910 --> 02:04:33,830
after them

2957
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,230
and tyrants

2958
02:04:35,230 --> 02:04:36,630
besides these

2959
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:37,230
Eudoxus

2960
02:04:38,690 --> 02:04:39,410
Hipparchus

2961
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:41,510
Confident

2962
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:42,610
mockers even

2963
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:43,610
of the perishable

2964
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:45,170
and ephemeral life of man

2965
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,230
as Manipus

2966
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:48,030
and such as are like him.

2967
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:49,530
As to all these

2968
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:51,090
consider that they have long

2969
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:51,950
been in the dust.

2970
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:54,430
What harm then is this to them

2971
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:55,830
and what to those

2972
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,710
whose names are altogether unknown?

2973
02:04:59,170 --> 02:05:00,110
One thing here

2974
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:01,410
is worth a great deal

2975
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:02,850
to pass thy life

2976
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:04,190
in truth and justice

2977
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:06,050
with a benevolent disposition

2978
02:05:06,050 --> 02:05:07,190
even to liars

2979
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:08,390
and unjust men.

2980
02:05:09,110 --> 02:05:09,950
When thou wishest

2981
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:11,210
to delight thyself

2982
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:12,390
think of the virtues

2983
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:13,770
of those who live with thee

2984
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:14,510
for instance

2985
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:15,750
the activity of one

2986
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:17,310
and the modesty of another

2987
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,370
and the liberality of a third

2988
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:21,190
and some other good quality

2989
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,070
of a fourth

2990
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:24,430
for nothing delights so much

2991
02:05:24,430 --> 02:05:26,550
as the examples of the virtues

2992
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:27,950
when they are exhibited

2993
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:28,890
in the morals

2994
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:30,550
of those who live with us

2995
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:32,010
and present themselves

2996
02:05:32,010 --> 02:05:32,910
in abundance

2997
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:35,090
as far as is possible.

2998
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:39,510
Thou art not dissatisfied

2999
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:40,490
I suppose

3000
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:42,090
because thou weigh'st

3001
02:05:42,090 --> 02:05:43,590
only so many litre

3002
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:45,390
and not three hundred.

3003
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:50,800
Let us try to persuade the men

3004
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:53,200
but act even against their will

3005
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,820
when the principles of justice

3006
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:55,940
lead that way.

3007
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:58,100
If however any man

3008
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,240
by using force

3009
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:00,880
stands in thy way

3010
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,600
betake thyself

3011
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,660
to contentment

3012
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:04,580
and tranquility

3013
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:07,170
and at the same time

3014
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:08,530
employ the hindrance

3015
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:09,690
towards the exercise

3016
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:11,170
of some other virtue.

3017
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:14,900
Reservation

3018
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:17,110
that thou dost not desire

3019
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:18,370
to do impossibilities

3020
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:20,890
what then didst thou desire?

3021
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:23,200
Some such effort is this

3022
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,520
but thou attainest thy object

3023
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,820
if the things to which

3024
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,700
thou wast moved

3025
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:28,540
are accomplished.

3026
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,380
He who loves fame

3027
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:32,200
considers another man's activity

3028
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,460
to be his own good

3029
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:35,420
and he who loves pleasure

3030
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,980
his own sensations

3031
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:39,300
but he who has understanding

3032
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,260
considers his own acts

3033
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,460
to be his own good.

3034
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:44,360
It is in our power

3035
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:45,900
to have no opinion

3036
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:46,780
about a thing.

3037
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,740
That which is not good

3038
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:51,540
for this form

3039
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:53,120
neither is it good for the bee.

3040
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:55,520
If sailors abused the helmsman

3041
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,200
or the sick, the doctor

3042
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,160
would they listen to anybody else

3043
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,740
or how could the helmsman

3044
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:01,660
secure the safety

3045
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:02,780
of those in the ship

3046
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:03,820
or the doctor

3047
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:04,840
the health of those

3048
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:05,700
whom he attends?

3049
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:07,460
How many together

3050
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,820
with whom I came into the world

3051
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:10,000
are already gone out.

3052
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,400
To the jaundiced honey

3053
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:12,220
tastes bitter

3054
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:13,460
and to those bitten

3055
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,720
by mad dogs

3056
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,440
water causes fear

3057
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:18,020
and to little children

3058
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:19,440
the ball is a fine thing.

3059
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:24,060
Why then am I angry?

3060
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:26,250
Does thou think

3061
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:27,210
that a false opinion

3062
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:28,090
has less power

3063
02:07:28,090 --> 02:07:29,730
than the bile in the jaundiced

3064
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,010
or the poison in him

3065
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:32,670
who is bitten by a mad dog?

3066
02:07:33,310 --> 02:07:34,810
No man will hinder thee

3067
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:35,910
from living according

3068
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:36,650
to the reason

3069
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:37,910
of thy own nature.

3070
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:40,430
Nothing will happen to thee

3071
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:41,790
contrary to the reason

3072
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:43,210
of the universal nature.

3073
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:45,840
What kind of people

3074
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,900
are those who men wish to please?

3075
02:07:49,370 --> 02:07:50,650
And for what objects?

3076
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:53,930
How soon will time

3077
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:55,250
cover all things

3078
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:56,310
and how many

3079
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:57,870
it has covered already?

3080
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,880
Book 7

3081
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,680
What is badness?

3082
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:06,060
It is that which

3083
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,480
thou hast often seen.

3084
02:08:09,290 --> 02:08:10,350
And on the occasion

3085
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,730
of everything which happens

3086
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:13,030
keep this in mind

3087
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,930
that it is that

3088
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:15,750
which thou hast often seen.

3089
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,610
Everywhere up and down

3090
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:19,210
thou wilt find the same things

3091
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:20,770
with which the old histories

3092
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:21,390
are filled

3093
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:22,990
those of the middle ages

3094
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:24,530
and those of our own day

3095
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:25,690
with which cities

3096
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:27,210
and houses are filled now.

3097
02:08:32,150 --> 02:08:33,330
How can our principles

3098
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:34,370
become dead

3099
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:36,610
unless the impressions, thoughts

3100
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:38,170
which correspond to them

3101
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:39,430
are extinguished?

3102
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:41,950
But it is in thy power

3103
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:42,590
continuously

3104
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:43,770
to fan these thoughts

3105
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:44,610
into a flame.

3106
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:46,680
I can have that opinion

3107
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:47,480
about anything

3108
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,960
which I ought to have.

3109
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:51,820
If I can, why am I disturbed?

3110
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,500
Look at things again

3111
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:57,560
as thou didst use

3112
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,060
to look at end them.

3113
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:00,280
For in this

3114
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,680
consists the recovery

3115
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:02,680
of thy life.

3116
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:04,840
The idle business of show

3117
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,480
plays on the stage

3118
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,520
flocks of sheep, herds,

3119
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,360
exercises with spears,

3120
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,600
a bone cast to little dogs,

3121
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,260
a bit of bread into fish ponds,

3122
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,740
labourings of ants

3123
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:17,840
and burden carrying,

3124
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,260
runnings about

3125
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:20,820
of frightened little mice,

3126
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,580
puppets.

3127
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:24,540
It is thy duty then

3128
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,180
in the midst of such things

3129
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,440
to show good humour

3130
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,120
and not a proud air,

3131
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:30,760
to understand, however,

3132
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,380
that every man is worth

3133
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:33,480
just so much

3134
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,760
as the things are worth

3135
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:36,400
about which he busies himself.

3136
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:37,700
In discourse,

3137
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:38,760
thou must attend

3138
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,720
to what is said,

3139
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:41,280
and in every movement

3140
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,300
thou must observe

3141
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,040
what is doing.

3142
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,520
Is my understanding

3143
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,240
sufficient for this or not?

3144
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:52,000
If it is sufficient,

3145
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:53,480
I use it for the work

3146
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:54,300
as an instrument

3147
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:56,140
given by the universal nature.

3148
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:58,300
But if it is not sufficient,

3149
02:09:58,660 --> 02:09:59,740
then either I retire

3150
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:00,440
from the work

3151
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,600
and give way to him

3152
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,060
who is able to do it better,

3153
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:04,680
unless there be some reason

3154
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,540
why I ought not to do so,

3155
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:08,500
or I do it as well as I can,

3156
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:09,520
taking to help.

3157
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:12,060
Me, the man who,

3158
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,840
with the aid of my ruling principle,

3159
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:15,640
can do what is now fit

3160
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:17,320
and useful for the general good,

3161
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:18,760
for whatsoever,

3162
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,240
either by myself

3163
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:21,200
or with another,

3164
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:22,120
I can do,

3165
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:23,660
ought to be directed

3166
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:24,680
to this only,

3167
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:26,240
to that which is useful

3168
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:27,980
and well suited to society.

3169
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,000
How many,

3170
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,780
after being celebrated by fame,

3171
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:33,400
have been given up to oblivion,

3172
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:35,340
and how many who have celebrated

3173
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,240
the fame of others

3174
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:37,380
have long been dead?

3175
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:39,830
Be not ashamed to be helped,

3176
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:41,830
for it is thy business

3177
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:43,290
to do thy duty,

3178
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:45,390
like a soldier in the assault

3179
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,270
on a town.

3180
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,160
Let not future things disturb thee,

3181
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,080
for thou wilt come to them,

3182
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:56,880
if it shall be necessary,

3183
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:58,180
having with thee

3184
02:10:58,180 --> 02:10:59,060
the same reason

3185
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,380
which now thou usest

3186
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:01,600
for present things.

3187
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:06,550
For things have been coordinated,

3188
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:07,550
and they combine

3189
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:09,170
to form the same universe,

3190
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:09,950
order.

3191
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:12,200
For there is one universe,

3192
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:14,200
made up of all things,

3193
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:15,620
and one God

3194
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:17,220
who pervades all things,

3195
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:18,960
and one substance,

3196
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:21,680
and one law,

3197
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,460
one common reason

3198
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:25,260
in all intelligent animals.

3199
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:29,710
Everything material soon disappears

3200
02:11:29,710 --> 02:11:31,190
in the substance of the whole,

3201
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,730
and everything formal,

3202
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,390
causal,

3203
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:35,450
is very soon taken back

3204
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,050
into the universal reason,

3205
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:38,710
and the memory of everything

3206
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:41,490
is very soon overwhelmed in time.

3207
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:43,090
To the rational animal,

3208
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:45,070
the same act is according to nature,

3209
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:46,690
and according to reason.

3210
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:48,900
Be thou erect,

3211
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:50,420
or be made erect.

3212
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:53,770
Just as it is

3213
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:55,270
with the members in those bodies

3214
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:56,710
which are united in one,

3215
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:58,650
so it is with rational beings

3216
02:11:58,650 --> 02:11:59,890
which exist separate,

3217
02:12:00,090 --> 02:12:01,670
for they have been constituted

3218
02:12:01,670 --> 02:12:03,030
for one cooperation,

3219
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:04,890
and the perception of this

3220
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:06,590
will be more apparent to thee.

3221
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:09,470
If thou often say'st to thyself,

3222
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:10,630
that I am a member

3223
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:12,650
of the system of rational beings.

3224
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:15,470
But if, using the letter R,

3225
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:17,590
thou say'st that thou art a part,

3226
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:19,550
thou dost not yet love men

3227
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:20,650
from thy heart.

3228
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:23,050
Beneficence does not yet delight thee

3229
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:24,090
for its own sake.

3230
02:12:25,740 --> 02:12:27,240
Thou still do'st it barely

3231
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:28,460
as a thing of,

3232
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:30,900
and let there fall externally.

3233
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,040
What will on the parts

3234
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,560
which can feel the effects

3235
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:35,540
of this fall?

3236
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:38,150
For those parts which have felt

3237
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:39,190
will complain,

3238
02:12:39,610 --> 02:12:40,650
if they choose.

3239
02:12:41,110 --> 02:12:41,870
But I,

3240
02:12:42,130 --> 02:12:43,010
unless I think

3241
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:43,970
that what has happened

3242
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:44,750
is an evil,

3243
02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:46,810
and it is in my power

3244
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:48,090
not to think so,

3245
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:50,250
whatever any one does or says,

3246
02:12:50,590 --> 02:12:51,630
I must be good.

3247
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:53,190
Just as if the gold,

3248
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:54,130
or the emerald,

3249
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:54,930
or the purple

3250
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:56,150
were always saying this,

3251
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:58,230
whatever any one does or says,

3252
02:12:58,650 --> 02:12:59,570
I must be emerald

3253
02:12:59,570 --> 02:13:00,630
and keep my color.

3254
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:02,190
The ruling faculty

3255
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:03,610
does not disturb itself,

3256
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:04,370
I mean,

3257
02:13:04,690 --> 02:13:05,910
does not frighten itself,

3258
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,390
or cause itself pain.

3259
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:15,090
But, if any one else

3260
02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:16,510
can frighten or pain it,

3261
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:17,670
let him do so.

3262
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,870
For the faculty itself

3263
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:20,510
will not,

3264
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:21,490
by its own opinion,

3265
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:23,190
turn itself into such ways.

3266
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:25,550
Let the body itself take care,

3267
02:13:25,830 --> 02:13:26,670
if it can,

3268
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:28,090
that it suffer nothing,

3269
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:29,850
and let it speak,

3270
02:13:30,270 --> 02:13:31,010
if it suffers.

3271
02:13:31,810 --> 02:13:33,470
But the soul itself,

3272
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:35,030
that which is subject

3273
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:35,710
to fear,

3274
02:13:35,890 --> 02:13:36,390
to pain,

3275
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:37,770
which has completely

3276
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:38,990
the power of forming

3277
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:40,730
an opinion about these things,

3278
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,150
will suffer nothing,

3279
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:44,210
for it will never deviate

3280
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:45,310
into such a judgment.

3281
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:47,090
The leading principle

3282
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:47,950
in itself

3283
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:49,130
wants nothing,

3284
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,030
unless it makes a want

3285
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:51,910
for itself,

3286
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:53,210
and therefore,

3287
02:13:53,530 --> 02:13:54,530
it is both free

3288
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:55,630
from perturbation,

3289
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:57,030
and unimpeded,

3290
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,430
if it does not disturb

3291
02:13:58,430 --> 02:13:59,610
and impede itself.

3292
02:14:04,660 --> 02:14:06,280
What then art thou doing here,

3293
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:07,320
O imagination?

3294
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:08,740
Go away,

3295
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,580
I entreat thee by the gods,

3296
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:11,920
as thou didst come,

3297
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:13,560
for I want thee not.

3298
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,210
Is any man afraid of change?

3299
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:21,090
Why?

3300
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:22,450
What can take place

3301
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:23,330
without change?

3302
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:25,250
What then is more pleasing,

3303
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:26,230
or more suitable

3304
02:14:26,230 --> 02:14:27,690
to the universal nature?

3305
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:30,130
And canst thou take a bath,

3306
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:31,030
unless the wood

3307
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:32,330
undergoes a change?

3308
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:35,050
And canst thou be nourished,

3309
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:36,170
unless the food

3310
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:37,590
undergoes an inchange?

3311
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:44,160
Through the universal substance,

3312
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:46,200
as through a furious torrent,

3313
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,840
all bodies are carried,

3314
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:49,320
being by their nature

3315
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:50,360
united with,

3316
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:51,880
and cooperating with,

3317
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:52,760
the whole,

3318
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:54,460
as the parts of our body

3319
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:55,320
with one another.

3320
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:00,700
And let the same thought

3321
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:01,420
occur to thee

3322
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:02,080
with reference

3323
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:03,500
to every man and thing.

3324
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,040
One thing only troubles me,

3325
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:07,500
lest I should do something

3326
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,220
which the constitution of man

3327
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,140
does not allow,

3328
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:11,380
or in the way which

3329
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:12,420
it does not allow,

3330
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:14,260
or what it does not allow now,

3331
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,300
near is thy forgetfulness

3332
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:17,240
of all things,

3333
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,900
and near the forgetfulness

3334
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,040
of thee by all.

3335
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:22,160
It is peculiar to man

3336
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,380
to love even those

3337
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:24,200
who do wrong.

3338
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:25,760
And this happens,

3339
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:27,680
if, when they do wrong,

3340
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:28,980
it occurs to thee

3341
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:30,460
that they are kinsmen,

3342
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:32,180
and that they do wrong

3343
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:32,900
through ignorance

3344
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,500
and unintentionally,

3345
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:35,540
and that soon

3346
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,920
both of you will die.

3347
02:15:40,490 --> 02:15:42,570
Wrongdoer has done thee no harm,

3348
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:43,870
for he has not made

3349
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:45,030
thy ruling faculty

3350
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:46,470
worse than it was before.

3351
02:15:46,770 --> 02:15:48,070
The universal nature

3352
02:15:48,070 --> 02:15:49,950
out of the universal substance,

3353
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:51,410
as if it were wax,

3354
02:15:51,790 --> 02:15:53,410
now molds a horse,

3355
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:55,570
and when it has broken this up,

3356
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:57,950
it uses the material for a tree,

3357
02:15:58,190 --> 02:15:59,570
then for a man,

3358
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,550
then for something else,

3359
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,050
and each of these things

3360
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:05,370
subsists for a very short time.

3361
02:16:05,630 --> 02:16:07,050
But it is no hardship

3362
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:08,670
for the vessel to be broken up,

3363
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:09,930
just as there was none

3364
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:11,470
in its being fastened together.

3365
02:16:12,010 --> 02:16:13,030
A scowling look

3366
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:14,570
is altogether unnatural,

3367
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:16,150
when it is often assumed

3368
02:16:16,150 --> 02:16:17,290
the result is that

3369
02:16:17,290 --> 02:16:18,770
all comeliness dies,

3370
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:20,430
and at last

3371
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:22,250
is so completely extinguished

3372
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,690
that it cannot be again

3373
02:16:23,690 --> 02:16:24,650
lighted up at all.

3374
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:25,970
Try to conclude,

3375
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:27,790
from this very fact,

3376
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:30,110
that it is contrary to reason.

3377
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:31,610
For if,

3378
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:32,810
even the perception

3379
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:34,350
of doing wrong shall depart,

3380
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:36,070
what reason is there

3381
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:37,290
for living any longer?

3382
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,610
Nature which governs the whole

3383
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,510
will soon change all things

3384
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:42,490
which thou seest,

3385
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:43,950
and out of their substance

3386
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,130
will make other things,

3387
02:16:45,390 --> 02:16:46,770
and again other things

3388
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:48,090
from the substance of them.

3389
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:50,390
In, when a man has done

3390
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:51,190
thee any wrong,

3391
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:52,570
immediately consider

3392
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:53,430
with what opinion

3393
02:16:53,430 --> 02:16:54,430
about good or evil

3394
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:55,570
he has done wrong.

3395
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:57,470
For when thou hast seen this,

3396
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:58,670
thou wilt pity him,

3397
02:16:58,810 --> 02:16:59,990
and wilt neither wonder

3398
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:01,070
nor be angry.

3399
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:02,710
For either thou thyself

3400
02:17:02,710 --> 02:17:03,730
thinkest the same thing

3401
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:04,390
to be good,

3402
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:05,430
that he does,

3403
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:06,610
or another thing

3404
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:07,650
of the same kind,

3405
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:09,270
it is thy duty then

3406
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:10,250
to pardon him.

3407
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:15,030
Think not so much

3408
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:16,250
of what thou hast not

3409
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:17,550
as of what thou hast,

3410
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:18,670
but of the things

3411
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:20,370
which thou hast select the best,

3412
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:21,330
and then reflect

3413
02:17:21,330 --> 02:17:22,090
how eagerly

3414
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,050
they would have been sought.

3415
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:25,280
If thou hast them not,

3416
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:27,240
at the same time, however,

3417
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:29,740
take care that thou dost not,

3418
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,660
through being so pleased with them,

3419
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:32,860
accustom thyself

3420
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:34,280
to overvalue them,

3421
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:35,620
so as to be disturbed,

3422
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:36,460
if ever,

3423
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:38,140
retire into thyself.

3424
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:39,540
The rational principle

3425
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:41,220
which rules has this nature,

3426
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:42,960
that it is content with itself

3427
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,420
when it does what is just,

3428
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,540
and so secures tranquility.

3429
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,540
Wipe out the imagination.

3430
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:50,840
Stop the pulling of the strings.

3431
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:52,900
Confine thyself to the present.

3432
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:54,440
Understand well

3433
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:55,800
what happens either to thee

3434
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:56,740
or to another.

3435
02:17:57,320 --> 02:17:58,540
Divide and distribute

3436
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:00,460
every object into the causal,

3437
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:01,380
informal,

3438
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:02,660
and the material.

3439
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:06,570
Direct thy attention

3440
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:07,350
to what is said.

3441
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:08,710
Let thy understanding

3442
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:09,870
enter into the things

3443
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:10,530
that are doing,

3444
02:18:10,670 --> 02:18:12,070
and the things which do them.

3445
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:18,130
Adorn thyself with simplicity

3446
02:18:18,130 --> 02:18:19,130
and modesty

3447
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:20,170
and with indifference

3448
02:18:20,170 --> 02:18:21,650
towards the things which lie

3449
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:23,330
between virtue and vice.

3450
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:25,650
Love mankind.

3451
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:30,560
About pain,

3452
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:32,300
the pain which is intolerable

3453
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,220
carries us off.

3454
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,800
But that which lasts

3455
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,960
a long time

3456
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,100
is tolerable.

3457
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:41,470
But the parts

3458
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:43,010
which are harmed by pain,

3459
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,710
let them,

3460
02:18:43,710 --> 02:18:44,550
if they can,

3461
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:46,770
give their opinion about it.

3462
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,130
About fame,

3463
02:18:48,390 --> 02:18:49,250
look at the minds

3464
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:50,670
of those who seek fame.

3465
02:18:50,670 --> 02:18:52,210
Observe what they are,

3466
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:54,090
and what kind of things they avoid,

3467
02:18:54,330 --> 02:18:56,150
and what kind of things they pursue.

3468
02:18:56,630 --> 02:18:57,730
And consider that,

3469
02:18:57,970 --> 02:18:59,730
as the heaps of sand piled

3470
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:00,590
on one another

3471
02:19:00,590 --> 02:19:01,990
hide the former sands,

3472
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:03,550
so in life the events

3473
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:04,530
which go before

3474
02:19:04,530 --> 02:19:05,630
are soon covered

3475
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:07,150
by those which come after.

3476
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:08,480
From Plato,

3477
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,680
the man who has

3478
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:10,720
an elevated mind

3479
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,200
and takes a view of all time

3480
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:13,160
and of all substance,

3481
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:14,980
dost thou suppose it possible

3482
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:15,800
for him to think

3483
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:16,480
that human life

3484
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,320
is anything great?

3485
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,760
It is not possible,

3486
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:19,500
he said.

3487
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:21,400
Such a man then will think

3488
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,220
that death also is no evil.

3489
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:27,750
Certainly not.

3490
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:31,710
From Antisthenes

3491
02:19:31,710 --> 02:19:33,070
it is royal to do good

3492
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:34,050
and to be abused.

3493
02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:35,630
It is a base thing

3494
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:36,630
for the countenance

3495
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:37,590
to be obedient

3496
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:38,770
and to regulate

3497
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:39,950
and compose itself

3498
02:19:39,950 --> 02:19:41,390
as the mind commands,

3499
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:42,730
and for the mind

3500
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:43,850
not to be regulated

3501
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:45,730
and composed by itself.

3502
02:19:46,330 --> 02:19:47,190
It is not right

3503
02:19:47,190 --> 02:19:48,850
to vex ourselves at things,

3504
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,890
for they care not about it.

3505
02:19:51,210 --> 02:19:52,470
To the immortal gods

3506
02:19:52,470 --> 02:19:53,790
and us give joy.

3507
02:19:57,370 --> 02:19:58,850
For the good is with me,

3508
02:19:58,890 --> 02:19:59,510
and the just.

3509
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,640
No joining others

3510
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,400
in their wailing,

3511
02:20:02,700 --> 02:20:03,960
no violent emotion.

3512
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:05,530
From Plato,

3513
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,110
but I would make this man

3514
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:08,250
a sufficient answer,

3515
02:20:08,910 --> 02:20:09,770
which is this.

3516
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:11,850
Thou sayest not well,

3517
02:20:12,130 --> 02:20:13,290
if thou thinkest

3518
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:14,010
that a man

3519
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:14,610
who is good

3520
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:15,990
for anything at all

3521
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:16,850
ought to compute

3522
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:17,930
the hazard of life

3523
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:18,590
or death,

3524
02:20:18,970 --> 02:20:19,930
and should not rather

3525
02:20:19,930 --> 02:20:20,670
look to this

3526
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:21,870
only in all that.

3527
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:23,090
He does,

3528
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:24,510
whether he is doing

3529
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:26,150
what is just or unjust,

3530
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:27,730
and the works of a good

3531
02:20:27,730 --> 02:20:29,230
or a bad man.

3532
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:31,240
For thus it is,

3533
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:32,340
man of Athens,

3534
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:33,340
in truth,

3535
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:34,560
wherever a man

3536
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:35,560
has placed himself

3537
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:37,380
thinking at the best place for him,

3538
02:20:37,580 --> 02:20:38,580
or has been placed

3539
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:39,320
by a commander.

3540
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:43,160
There, in my opinion,

3541
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:44,080
he ought to stay

3542
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,360
and to abide the hazard,

3543
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:48,320
taking nothing

3544
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:49,180
into the reckoning,

3545
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:50,020
either death

3546
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:51,020
or anything else

3547
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:51,920
before the baseness

3548
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,080
of deserting his post.

3549
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,760
You need to add some text

3550
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:56,620
for me to talk.

3551
02:20:57,690 --> 02:20:58,170
N.

3552
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:00,720
But, my good friend,

3553
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:02,500
reflect whether that

3554
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:03,820
which is noble and good

3555
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,220
is not something different

3556
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:06,860
from saving and being saved,

3557
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,180
for as to a man

3558
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:09,780
living such or such a time,

3559
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:10,920
at least one

3560
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,220
who is really a man,

3561
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,460
consider if this is not a thing

3562
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,280
to be dismissed

3563
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,180
from the thoughts,

3564
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,400
and there must be

3565
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:18,480
no love of life.

3566
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:20,420
But as to these matters

3567
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:22,420
a man must entrust.

3568
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:24,400
Damn to the deity,

3569
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,660
and believe

3570
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:26,780
what the women say,

3571
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,000
that no man

3572
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,320
can escape his destiny.

3573
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:30,700
The next inquiry

3574
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:32,360
being how he may best live

3575
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:34,020
the time that he has to live.

3576
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,460
Look round at the courses

3577
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:36,280
of the stars,

3578
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,360
as if thou wert

3579
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,620
going along with them,

3580
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,060
and constantly consider

3581
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:41,440
the changes of the elements

3582
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:42,380
into one another,

3583
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:43,640
for such thoughts

3584
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:44,940
purge away the filth

3585
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:45,880
of the Terran life.

3586
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:47,900
You need to add some text

3587
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:48,800
for me to talk.

3588
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:51,160
This is a fine saying of Plato,

3589
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:52,980
that he who is discoursing

3590
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,780
about men

3591
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:54,960
should look also

3592
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:56,240
at earthly things,

3593
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:57,760
as if he viewed them

3594
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,260
from some higher place,

3595
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:00,860
should look at them

3596
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:02,080
in their assemblies,

3597
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:02,980
armies,

3598
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:04,540
agricultural labors,

3599
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:05,360
marriages,

3600
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,160
treaties,

3601
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:07,060
births,

3602
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:07,600
deaths,

3603
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:09,780
noise of the courts of justice,

3604
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:10,900
desert places,

3605
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:13,020
various nations of barbarians,

3606
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:14,060
feasts,

3607
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,320
lamentations,

3608
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,120
markets,

3609
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:17,880
a mixture of all things,

3610
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:19,320
and an orderly combination

3611
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:20,240
of contraries.

3612
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:21,800
Consider the past,

3613
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:22,900
such great changes

3614
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:24,400
of political supremacies,

3615
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,860
thou mayst foresee also

3616
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:27,320
the things which will be,

3617
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:28,940
for they will certainly be

3618
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:29,940
of like form,

3619
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:31,440
and it is not possible

3620
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:32,700
that they should deviate

3621
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:34,120
from the order of the things

3622
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:35,420
which take place now.

3623
02:22:36,490 --> 02:22:37,030
Accordingly,

3624
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:38,950
to have contemplated human life

3625
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:40,150
for forty years

3626
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:41,770
is the same as to have.

3627
02:22:42,490 --> 02:22:44,110
For what more wilt thou see,

3628
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:45,370
that which is grown

3629
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:46,810
from the earth to the earth,

3630
02:22:47,290 --> 02:22:48,530
but that which is sprung

3631
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:49,750
from heavenly seed,

3632
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:51,910
back to the heavenly realms

3633
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:52,550
returns.

3634
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,920
This is either

3635
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,740
a dissolution

3636
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:57,080
of the mutual involution

3637
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:57,800
of the atoms,

3638
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:00,120
or a similar indispersion

3639
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,680
of the unsentient elements,

3640
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,080
with food and drinks

3641
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,360
and cunning magic arts

3642
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:06,580
turning the channel's course

3643
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,820
to escape from death.

3644
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:14,180
Another may be more expert

3645
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:15,380
in casting his opponent,

3646
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:16,940
but he is not more social,

3647
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,140
nor more modest,

3648
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:19,480
nor better disciplined

3649
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:21,140
to meet all that happens,

3650
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:22,820
nor more considerate with.

3651
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,340
Where any work

3652
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:25,980
can be done conformably

3653
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:27,500
to the reason which is common

3654
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:28,880
to gods and men,

3655
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:31,200
there we have nothing to fear.

3656
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,280
For where we are able

3657
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:34,120
to get profit

3658
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:35,560
by means of the activity

3659
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:36,620
which is successful

3660
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:37,860
and proceeds according

3661
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:39,060
to our constitution,

3662
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:40,440
there no harm

3663
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:41,620
is to be suspected.

3664
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:45,470
Everywhere and at all times

3665
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:47,030
it is in thy power

3666
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:49,150
piously to acquiesce

3667
02:23:49,150 --> 02:23:50,430
in thy present condition,

3668
02:23:50,930 --> 02:23:52,110
and to behave justly

3669
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:53,530
to those who are about thee,

3670
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,650
and to exert thy skill

3671
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:57,170
upon thy present thoughts,

3672
02:23:57,410 --> 02:23:59,130
that nothing shall steal into them

3673
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:00,570
without being well examined.

3674
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:02,750
Do not look around thee

3675
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:04,030
to discover other men's

3676
02:24:04,030 --> 02:24:04,890
ruling principles,

3677
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:06,630
but look straight to this,

3678
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:08,530
to what nature leads thee,

3679
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:10,530
both the universal nature

3680
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:11,530
through the things

3681
02:24:11,530 --> 02:24:12,530
which happen to thee,

3682
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,130
and thy own nature

3683
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:15,250
through the acts

3684
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:16,790
which must be done by thee.

3685
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:18,630
But every being ought to do

3686
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:19,750
that which is according

3687
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:20,930
to its constitution,

3688
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:22,450
and all other things

3689
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:23,570
have been constituted

3690
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:25,350
for the sake of rational beings,

3691
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:27,870
just as among irrational things,

3692
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,910
the inferior

3693
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:30,430
for the sake of the superior.

3694
02:24:31,290 --> 02:24:32,450
But the rational,

3695
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:33,970
for the sake of one another.

3696
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:36,490
You need to add some text

3697
02:24:36,490 --> 02:24:37,350
for me to talk.

3698
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,640
And the second is not to yield

3699
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,300
to the persuasions of the body,

3700
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:43,500
for it is the peculiar office

3701
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,360
of the rational

3702
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:45,620
and intelligent motion

3703
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:47,360
to circumscribe itself,

3704
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:49,440
and never to be overpowered,

3705
02:24:50,650 --> 02:24:51,670
either by the motion

3706
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:52,530
of the senses

3707
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:53,890
or of the appetites,

3708
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:55,910
for both are animal.

3709
02:24:57,300 --> 02:24:58,540
But the intelligent motion

3710
02:24:58,540 --> 02:24:59,760
claims superiority.

3711
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,120
The prime principle then

3712
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:03,480
in man's constitution

3713
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,140
is the in-social,

3714
02:25:05,970 --> 02:25:07,250
and with good reason,

3715
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:09,280
for it is formed by nature

3716
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:10,460
to use all of them.

3717
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,760
Let then the ruling principle

3718
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,540
holding fast to these things

3719
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:19,060
go straight on,

3720
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,080
and it has what is its own.

3721
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:26,390
Love that only which happens

3722
02:25:26,390 --> 02:25:26,830
to thee

3723
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:28,090
and is spun with the thread

3724
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:29,070
of thy destiny,

3725
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:30,880
for what is more suitable,

3726
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:32,920
in everything which happens,

3727
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:34,740
keep before thy eyes

3728
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:35,720
those to whom

3729
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:37,040
the same things happened,

3730
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:38,680
and how they were vexed

3731
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:39,420
and treated them

3732
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:40,480
as strange things,

3733
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:42,400
and found fault with them,

3734
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,500
and now where are they?

3735
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:49,220
Why then dost thou too

3736
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:50,740
choose to act in the same way?

3737
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,780
And why dost thou not leave

3738
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:54,000
these agitations

3739
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,620
which are foreign to nature,

3740
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,500
to those who cause them,

3741
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:59,260
and those who are moved by them?

3742
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:04,560
And why art thou not

3743
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,600
altogether intent

3744
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:06,660
upon the right way

3745
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:07,500
of making use

3746
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,120
of the things

3747
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:09,240
which happen to thee?

3748
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:13,040
For then thou wilt use them well,

3749
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:14,820
and they will be a material

3750
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:16,500
for thee to work on.

3751
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:19,200
Only attend to thyself,

3752
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:21,160
and resolve to be a good man

3753
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,260
in every act

3754
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:23,280
which thou doest.

3755
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:25,060
And remember,

3756
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,540
the body ought to be compact,

3757
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:30,700
and to show no new regularity

3758
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:32,800
either in motion or attitude,

3759
02:26:34,310 --> 02:26:36,190
for what the mind shows in the face,

3760
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:37,550
by maintaining in it

3761
02:26:37,550 --> 02:26:39,110
the expression of intelligence

3762
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:40,110
and propriety,

3763
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:43,240
that ought to be required

3764
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:45,040
also in the whole body,

3765
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,740
but all of these things

3766
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:48,280
should be observed

3767
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:49,720
without affectation.

3768
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:54,160
The art of life is more like

3769
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:55,440
the wrestler's art

3770
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:56,460
than the dancer's,

3771
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:57,640
in respect of this,

3772
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:59,080
that it should stand ready

3773
02:26:59,080 --> 02:26:59,920
and firm

3774
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:01,180
to meet onsets

3775
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:03,000
which are sudden and unexpected.

3776
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:04,620
Constantly observe

3777
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,700
who those are,

3778
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
whose approbation

3779
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,140
thou wishest to have,

3780
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:09,700
and what ruling principles

3781
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:10,520
they possess.

3782
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,280
For then thou wilt neither blame

3783
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,460
those who offend involuntarily,

3784
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,840
nor wilt thou want

3785
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:17,900
their approbation,

3786
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,620
if thou lookest to the sources

3787
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:21,440
of their opinions and appetites.

3788
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:24,020
Every soul, the philosopher says,

3789
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:27,100
is involuntarily deprived of truth.

3790
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:29,680
Consequently, in the same way,

3791
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:31,460
it is deprived of justice

3792
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:32,360
and temperance

3793
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:33,540
and benevolence

3794
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:35,120
and everything of the kind.

3795
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,780
In every pain

3796
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:41,480
let this thought be present,

3797
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:44,600
that there is no dishonor in it,

3798
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:46,060
nor does it make

3799
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:48,100
the governing intelligence worse,

3800
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,780
for it does not damage

3801
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:51,760
the intelligence.

3802
02:27:57,430 --> 02:27:58,950
You need to add some text

3803
02:27:58,950 --> 02:27:59,850
for me to talk.

3804
02:28:00,810 --> 02:28:03,030
Indeed, in the case of most pains,

3805
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:05,990
let this remark of Epicurus aid thee.

3806
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:08,830
That pain is neither intolerable

3807
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:09,870
nor everlasting,

3808
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:12,690
if thou bearest in mind

3809
02:28:12,690 --> 02:28:14,110
that it has its limits,

3810
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,190
and if thou addest nothing

3811
02:28:16,190 --> 02:28:17,550
to it in imagination.

3812
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,560
And remember this, too,

3813
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:22,920
that we do not perceive

3814
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:23,840
that many things

3815
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:25,300
which are disagreeable to us

3816
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:26,680
are the same as pain,

3817
02:28:27,060 --> 02:28:29,560
such as excessive drowsiness

3818
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:31,400
and the being scorched by heat

3819
02:28:34,430 --> 02:28:36,050
and the having no appetite.

3820
02:28:36,510 --> 02:28:38,850
When then thou art discontented

3821
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:40,350
about any of these things,

3822
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:41,650
say to thyself

3823
02:28:41,650 --> 02:28:43,830
that thou art not yielding to pain.

3824
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:50,040
You need to add some text

3825
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:51,020
for me to talk,

3826
02:28:51,700 --> 02:28:52,740
for it is not enough

3827
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:53,840
that Socrates died

3828
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:54,880
a more noble death

3829
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,920
and disputed more skillfully

3830
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:57,980
with the sophists,

3831
02:28:58,460 --> 02:28:59,860
and passed the night in the cold

3832
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:00,940
with more endurance,

3833
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:02,620
and that when he was bid

3834
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:04,400
to arrest Leon of Salamis,

3835
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:06,640
he considered it more noble

3836
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:07,520
to refuse,

3837
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:08,840
and that he walked

3838
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:10,660
in a swaggering way in the streets.

3839
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:12,740
Though as to this fact

3840
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:13,840
one may have great

3841
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,460
what kind of a soul it was

3842
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:18,080
that Socrates possessed,

3843
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:20,260
and if he was able to be content

3844
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:22,000
with being just towards men

3845
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,160
and pious towards the gods,

3846
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,120
neither idly vexed

3847
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:27,520
on account of men's villainy,

3848
02:29:28,770 --> 02:29:30,870
nor yet making himself a slave

3849
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:32,350
to any man's ignorance,

3850
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:37,380
nor enduring it as intolerable,

3851
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:38,780
nor allowing his understanding

3852
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:40,220
to sympathize with the affects

3853
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,420
of the miserable flesh.

3854
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:43,780
Nature has not so mingled

3855
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:44,580
the intelligence

3856
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:46,420
with the composition of the body,

3857
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,380
as not to have allowed thee

3858
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:50,880
the power of circumscribing thyself,

3859
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:52,780
and of bringing under subjection

3860
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:53,520
to thyself

3861
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,020
all that is thy own,

3862
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:56,780
for it is very possible

3863
02:29:56,780 --> 02:29:58,040
to be a divine man,

3864
02:29:58,380 --> 02:30:00,020
and to be recognized as such

3865
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:00,980
by no one.

3866
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:03,020
Always bear this in mind.

3867
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:04,960
And another thing too,

3868
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,320
that very little indeed

3869
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:07,620
is necessary for living

3870
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:08,500
a happy life.

3871
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:11,060
And because thou hast despaired

3872
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:12,600
of becoming a dialectician

3873
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:14,660
and skilled in the knowledge of nature,

3874
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,340
do not for this reason

3875
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:17,240
renounce the hope

3876
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:19,200
of being both free and modest,

3877
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,900
and social, and obedient to God.

3878
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:23,500
It is in thy power

3879
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:25,580
to live free from all compulsion,

3880
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:28,020
in the greatest tranquillity of mind,

3881
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:30,200
even if all the world

3882
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:31,340
cry out against thee

3883
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:32,740
as much as they choose.

3884
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:38,630
NAND!

3885
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:42,480
For what hinders the mind,

3886
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:44,120
in the midst of all this,

3887
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:45,580
from maintaining itself

3888
02:30:45,580 --> 02:30:46,760
in tranquillity,

3889
02:30:46,980 --> 02:30:48,140
and in a just judgment

3890
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:49,740
of all surrounding things,

3891
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:51,840
and in a ready use

3892
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:52,660
of the objects

3893
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:54,180
which are presented to it,

3894
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:56,280
so that the judgment may say

3895
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:57,460
to the thing which falls

3896
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,760
under its observation,

3897
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,700
This thou art,

3898
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:01,680
in substance,

3899
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:02,520
reality.

3900
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:06,120
You need to add some text

3901
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,000
for me to talk.

3902
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:08,680
My est appear to be

3903
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:09,680
of a different kind,

3904
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:11,620
and the use shall say to that

3905
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:13,140
which falls under the hand,

3906
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:14,840
Thou art the thing

3907
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:15,760
that I was seeking.

3908
02:31:16,420 --> 02:31:18,480
For to me that which presents itself

3909
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:20,660
is always a material for virtue,

3910
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:22,700
both rational and political,

3911
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:24,320
and, in a word,

3912
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:26,380
for the exercise of art,

3913
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,840
which belongs to man or God.

3914
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:30,540
For everything which happens

3915
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:31,520
has a relationship

3916
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:32,940
either to God or man,

3917
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:34,180
and is neither new

3918
02:31:34,180 --> 02:31:35,440
nor difficult to handle,

3919
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:37,460
but usual and apt matter

3920
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:38,140
to work on.

3921
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:40,180
The perfection of moral character

3922
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,140
consists in this,

3923
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:43,360
in passing every day as the last,

3924
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:44,360
and in being neither

3925
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:45,420
violently excited,

3926
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:46,240
nor torpid,

3927
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,660
nor playing the hypocrite.

3928
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:49,500
The gods who are immortal

3929
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:50,520
are not vexed

3930
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,260
because during so long a time

3931
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:54,360
they must tolerate continually.

3932
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,780
Men such as they are,

3933
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:58,340
and so many of them bad.

3934
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:02,390
But thou,

3935
02:32:02,530 --> 02:32:04,470
who art destined to end so soon,

3936
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:05,590
art thou wearied

3937
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:06,710
of enduring the bad,

3938
02:32:07,050 --> 02:32:07,990
and this too,

3939
02:32:08,170 --> 02:32:09,390
when thou art one of them.

3940
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:15,460
Whatever the rational

3941
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:17,780
and political, social faculty

3942
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:19,440
finds to be neither intelligent

3943
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:20,380
nor social,

3944
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,740
it properly judges

3945
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:23,520
to be inferior to itself.

3946
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:26,000
And when thou hast done a good act

3947
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,600
and another has received it,

3948
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:28,960
why dost thou look

3949
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:29,820
for a third thing

3950
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:30,800
besides these,

3951
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:31,940
as fools do,

3952
02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:33,800
either to have the reputation

3953
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:35,120
of having done a good act,

3954
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:36,580
or to obtain a return?

3955
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:38,960
No man is tired of receiving

3956
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:39,780
what is useful.

3957
02:32:40,460 --> 02:32:41,700
But it is useful

3958
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,360
to act according to nature.

3959
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:48,330
Do not then be tired

3960
02:32:48,330 --> 02:32:49,730
of receiving what is useful

3961
02:32:49,730 --> 02:32:51,010
by doing it to others.

3962
02:32:53,950 --> 02:32:54,990
But now,

3963
02:32:55,130 --> 02:32:57,150
either everything that takes place

3964
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:58,950
comes by way of consequence

3965
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:00,330
or continuity,

3966
02:33:00,850 --> 02:33:02,150
or even the chief things

3967
02:33:02,150 --> 02:33:03,130
towards which

3968
02:33:03,130 --> 02:33:05,210
the ruling power of the universe

3969
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:06,690
directs its own movement

3970
02:33:06,690 --> 02:33:07,570
are governed

3971
02:33:07,570 --> 02:33:09,410
by no rational principle.

3972
02:33:10,050 --> 02:33:11,050
If this is remembered,

3973
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:12,470
it will make thee more tranquil

3974
02:33:12,470 --> 02:33:13,510
in many things.

3975
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:15,780
Book 8

3976
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:18,400
This reflection also tends

3977
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,300
to the removal

3978
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:21,520
of the desire of empty fame,

3979
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:23,280
that it is no longer

3980
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:24,160
in thy power

3981
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:24,820
to have lived

3982
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:26,220
the whole of thy life,

3983
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:27,880
or at least thy life

3984
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:29,360
from thy youth upwards,

3985
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:30,780
like a philosopher.

3986
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:35,820
But both to many others

3987
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:37,220
and to thyself

3988
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:39,280
it is plain that thou,

3989
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:40,640
thou hast fallen

3990
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:41,900
into disorder then

3991
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:43,160
so that it is no longer

3992
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:43,980
easy for thee

3993
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:45,060
to get the reputation

3994
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:46,060
of a philosopher,

3995
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:47,920
and thy plan of life

3996
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,540
also opposes it.

3997
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:52,000
If then thou hast truly seen

3998
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,180
where the matter lies,

3999
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:54,460
throw away the thought

4000
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:56,520
how thou shalt seem to others,

4001
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,120
and be content

4002
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:59,260
if thou shalt live

4003
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:00,400
the rest of thy life

4004
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:01,420
in such wise

4005
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:02,760
as thy nature wills.

4006
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:05,240
Observe then what it wills,

4007
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,220
and let nothing else

4008
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:07,240
distract thee,

4009
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:09,120
for thou hast had experience

4010
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,160
of many wanderings

4011
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:11,100
without having found

4012
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:12,100
happiness anywhere,

4013
02:34:12,820 --> 02:34:13,960
not in syllogisms,

4014
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:15,100
nor in wealth,

4015
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:16,540
nor in reputation,

4016
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:17,860
nor in enjoyment,

4017
02:34:18,660 --> 02:34:19,440
nor anywhere.

4018
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:21,080
Where is it then?

4019
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:23,040
In doing what man's

4020
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,160
nature requires.

4021
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:26,300
How then shall a man do

4022
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:27,000
in this?

4023
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:28,800
If he has principles

4024
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:29,460
from which come

4025
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:30,100
his effects

4026
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:30,980
and his acts,

4027
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,100
what principles?

4028
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:34,220
Those which relate

4029
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:35,220
to good and bad,

4030
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:36,060
the belief that

4031
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:36,880
there is nothing good

4032
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:37,440
for man

4033
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,500
which does not make

4034
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,140
him just,

4035
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:39,840
temperate,

4036
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:40,480
manly,

4037
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:40,920
free,

4038
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:41,920
and that there is

4039
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:42,680
nothing bad

4040
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:43,780
which does not.

4041
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:44,900
On the occasion

4042
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:46,000
of every act,

4043
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:47,280
ask thyself

4044
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:48,080
how is this

4045
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:49,300
with respect to me?

4046
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:51,000
Shall I repent of it?

4047
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:02,930
A little time,

4048
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:03,910
and I am dead,

4049
02:35:04,190 --> 02:35:05,030
and all is gone.

4050
02:35:05,150 --> 02:35:06,950
What more do I seek

4051
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:08,350
if what I am now doing

4052
02:35:08,350 --> 02:35:09,230
is work of an

4053
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:10,410
intelligent living being

4054
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:11,730
and a social being

4055
02:35:11,730 --> 02:35:12,790
and one who is under

4056
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:14,270
the same law with God?

4057
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:16,430
Alexander and Gaius

4058
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:17,410
and Pompeius,

4059
02:35:17,850 --> 02:35:18,450
what are they

4060
02:35:18,450 --> 02:35:19,110
in comparison

4061
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:20,110
with Diogenes

4062
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:21,030
and Heraclitus

4063
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,850
and Socrates?

4064
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:27,860
But as to the others,

4065
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:28,900
how many things

4066
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:30,120
had they to care for

4067
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:31,200
and to how many things

4068
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,200
were they slaves?

4069
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,500
Consider that men

4070
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:35,640
will do the same things

4071
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:36,320
nevertheless,

4072
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,400
even though thou

4073
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:38,160
shouldst burst.

4074
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:39,920
This is the chief thing.

4075
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,140
Be not perturbed,

4076
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:41,820
for all things

4077
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:42,360
are according

4078
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:42,940
to the nature

4079
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:43,680
of the universal,

4080
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,280
and in a little time

4081
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:45,940
thou wilt be

4082
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:46,380
nobody

4083
02:35:46,380 --> 02:35:47,040
and nowhere.

4084
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:49,360
In the next place,

4085
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:50,800
having fixed thy eyes

4086
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,260
steadily on thy business,

4087
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:53,580
look at it,

4088
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:55,060
and at the same time,

4089
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:55,960
remembering that

4090
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:56,920
it is thy duty

4091
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:58,140
to be a good man,

4092
02:35:58,500 --> 02:35:59,440
and what man's

4093
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,340
nature demands,

4094
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:01,500
do that

4095
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:02,800
without turning aside.

4096
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:10,200
The nature of the universal

4097
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:11,420
has this work to do,

4098
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,380
to remove to that place

4099
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:15,020
the things which are in this,

4100
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:16,400
to change them,

4101
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:17,840
to take them away.

4102
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:23,300
You need to add some text

4103
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:24,180
for me to talk.

4104
02:36:25,050 --> 02:36:26,630
Every nature is contented

4105
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:27,290
with itself

4106
02:36:27,290 --> 02:36:29,330
when it goes on its way well,

4107
02:36:29,910 --> 02:36:31,150
and a rational nature

4108
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:32,650
goes on its way well.

4109
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:34,560
When in its thoughts

4110
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:35,820
it ascends to nothing

4111
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,020
false or uncertain,

4112
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:38,660
and when it directs

4113
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:39,260
its movements

4114
02:36:39,260 --> 02:36:40,780
to social acts only,

4115
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:42,420
and when it confines

4116
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:44,240
its desires and aversions

4117
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,040
to the things

4118
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:46,380
which are in its power,

4119
02:36:48,230 --> 02:36:50,370
everything that is assigned to it

4120
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:51,530
by the common nature,

4121
02:36:52,310 --> 02:36:53,430
you need to add some text

4122
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:54,350
for me to talk.

4123
02:36:55,230 --> 02:36:56,810
For of this common nature

4124
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:58,690
every particular nature

4125
02:36:58,690 --> 02:36:59,490
is a part,

4126
02:37:00,050 --> 02:37:01,630
as the nature of the leaf

4127
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:03,190
is a part of the nature

4128
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:04,050
of the plant,

4129
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,420
intelligent and just,

4130
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,860
since it gives to everything

4131
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,700
in equal portions,

4132
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,940
and according to its worth,

4133
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,160
times, substance,

4134
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:15,400
cause, form,

4135
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:16,280
activity,

4136
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:17,220
and incident.

4137
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:19,940
All things are familiar to us,

4138
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:21,540
but the distribution of them

4139
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:22,860
still remains the same.

4140
02:37:23,180 --> 02:37:24,000
But examine,

4141
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:25,220
not to discover

4142
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:26,280
that any one thing

4143
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:28,060
compared with any other single thing

4144
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:29,700
is equal in all respects,

4145
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:31,280
but by taking all the parts

4146
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:32,460
together of one thing

4147
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:33,520
and comparing them

4148
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,680
with all the parts together

4149
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:35,200
of another.

4150
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:36,740
Thou hast not leisure

4151
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:38,200
or ability to read,

4152
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:39,960
but thou hast leisure

4153
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:41,800
or ability to check arrogance.

4154
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:43,440
Thou hast leisure

4155
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:44,300
to be superior

4156
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:45,600
to pleasure and pain.

4157
02:37:46,330 --> 02:37:47,230
Thou hast leisure

4158
02:37:47,230 --> 02:37:48,070
to be superior

4159
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:49,070
to love of fame,

4160
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:50,770
and not to be vexed

4161
02:37:50,770 --> 02:37:52,320
at stupid and ungrateful people,

4162
02:37:53,410 --> 02:37:54,930
nay, even to care for them.

4163
02:37:55,590 --> 02:37:57,050
Let no man any longer

4164
02:37:57,050 --> 02:37:58,490
hear thee finding fault

4165
02:37:58,490 --> 02:37:59,790
with the court life

4166
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:00,930
or with thy own,

4167
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,160
but no such man

4168
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:06,100
would ever repent

4169
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:07,400
of having refused

4170
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:08,780
any sensual pleasure.

4171
02:38:10,770 --> 02:38:11,890
Pleasure, then,

4172
02:38:12,030 --> 02:38:13,810
is neither good nor useful.

4173
02:38:14,950 --> 02:38:15,830
This thing,

4174
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,810
what is it in itself,

4175
02:38:18,110 --> 02:38:19,630
in its own constitution?

4176
02:38:20,450 --> 02:38:21,690
What is its substance

4177
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:22,410
and material?

4178
02:38:23,030 --> 02:38:24,730
And what its causal nature

4179
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:25,770
or form?

4180
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:26,970
And what is it doing

4181
02:38:26,970 --> 02:38:27,670
in the world?

4182
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:29,330
And how long does it subsist?

4183
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:31,830
When thou risest

4184
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:33,190
from sleep with reluctance,

4185
02:38:34,330 --> 02:38:35,310
remember that it is

4186
02:38:35,310 --> 02:38:37,050
according to thy constitution

4187
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:39,390
and according to human nature

4188
02:38:39,390 --> 02:38:41,010
to perform social acts.

4189
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:43,840
But sleeping is common also

4190
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,460
to irrational animals.

4191
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:47,360
But that which is according

4192
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:48,840
to each individual's nature

4193
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:50,640
is also more peculiarly

4194
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,220
its own and more suitable

4195
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:53,060
to its nature,

4196
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:55,440
and indeed also more agreeable.

4197
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:57,020
Constantly and,

4198
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:58,120
if it be possible,

4199
02:38:58,540 --> 02:38:59,720
on the occasion of every

4200
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:00,920
impression on the soul,

4201
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:02,400
apply to it the principles

4202
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,040
of physic, of ethic,

4203
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,420
and of dialectic.

4204
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:07,800
Whatever man thou meetest with,

4205
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:09,760
immediately say to thyself,

4206
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:11,800
What opinions has this man

4207
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,600
about good and bad?

4208
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:15,580
For if, with respect to

4209
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:16,640
pleasure and pain

4210
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,060
and the causes of each,

4211
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:20,040
and with respect to fame

4212
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:20,960
and ignominy,

4213
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:22,300
death and life,

4214
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:24,340
he has such and such opinions,

4215
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,520
will seem nothing wonderful

4216
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:31,940
or strange to me.

4217
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:35,960
Remember that as it is ashamed

4218
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:36,840
to be surprised

4219
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:39,080
if the fig tree produces figs,

4220
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:40,480
so it is to be surprised

4221
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:41,860
if the world produces

4222
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:43,240
such and such things,

4223
02:39:43,460 --> 02:39:45,040
of which it is productive.

4224
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:49,540
Remember that,

4225
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:51,140
to change thy opinion

4226
02:39:51,140 --> 02:39:52,580
and to follow him

4227
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,960
who corrects thy error

4228
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:56,080
is as consistent with freedom

4229
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,800
as it is to persist

4230
02:39:57,800 --> 02:39:59,100
in thy error.

4231
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:01,550
For it is thy own,

4232
02:40:01,850 --> 02:40:03,890
and the activity which is exerted,

4233
02:40:04,010 --> 02:40:05,430
according to thy own movement

4234
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,210
and judgment,

4235
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:07,790
and indeed,

4236
02:40:08,430 --> 02:40:09,650
according to thy own

4237
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:10,890
understanding too.

4238
02:40:11,450 --> 02:40:13,470
If a thing is in thy own power,

4239
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:15,090
why dost thou do it?

4240
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:16,830
But if it is in the power

4241
02:40:16,830 --> 02:40:17,450
of another,

4242
02:40:17,810 --> 02:40:18,890
whom dost thou blame?

4243
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:20,210
The atoms,

4244
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:20,910
chance,

4245
02:40:21,130 --> 02:40:21,790
or the gods?

4246
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:24,420
Both are foolish.

4247
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:31,120
For if thou canst,

4248
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:33,160
correct that which is the cause.

4249
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,280
But if thou canst not do this,

4250
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:37,180
correct at least the thing itself.

4251
02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:40,340
But if thou canst not do even this,

4252
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:44,300
for nothing should be done

4253
02:40:44,300 --> 02:40:45,300
without a purpose.

4254
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:47,360
That which is died

4255
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:49,200
falls not out of the universe.

4256
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:55,320
And these too change,

4257
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,000
and they murmur not.

4258
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:04,260
Everything exists for some end,

4259
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:05,400
a horse,

4260
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:06,220
a vine.

4261
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:07,720
Why dost thou wonder?

4262
02:41:08,570 --> 02:41:09,810
Even the sun will say,

4263
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:11,370
I am for some purpose,

4264
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,530
and the rest of the gods

4265
02:41:12,530 --> 02:41:13,530
will say the same.

4266
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:14,870
For what purpose?

4267
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:16,530
Then art thou.

4268
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:20,200
What good is it then

4269
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:21,700
for the ball to be thrown up?

4270
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:23,620
Or harm for it to come down,

4271
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:24,840
or even to have fallen?

4272
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:27,440
And what good is it to the bubble

4273
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:28,700
while it holds together?

4274
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:30,860
Or what harm when it is burst?

4275
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:35,780
Turn it, the body,

4276
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,020
inside out,

4277
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:38,600
and see what kind of thing it is.

4278
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:40,140
And when it has grown old,

4279
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:41,780
what kind of thing it becomes,

4280
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:43,660
and when it is diseased.

4281
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:45,580
Short-lived are both

4282
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:47,100
the praiser and the praised.

4283
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,180
And the rememberer

4284
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:50,060
and the remembered.

4285
02:41:50,780 --> 02:41:52,020
And all this in a nook

4286
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:53,320
of this part of the world.

4287
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:55,660
And not even here do all agree,

4288
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:57,620
no, not any one with.

4289
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,080
Attend to the matter

4290
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:00,180
which is before thee,

4291
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:01,600
whether it is an opinion,

4292
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,040
or an act, or a word.

4293
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:05,300
Thou suffer'st this justly,

4294
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:06,660
for thou choosest rather

4295
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:08,160
to become good to-morrow

4296
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,540
than to be good to-day.

4297
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:12,810
I do it with reference

4298
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:14,170
to the good of mankind.

4299
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:16,660
Does anything happen to me?

4300
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:18,520
I receive it,

4301
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:19,880
and refer it to the gods,

4302
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,960
and the source of all things,

4303
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,540
from which all that happens

4304
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,440
is derived.

4305
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:27,980
Such as bathing appears to thee,

4306
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:31,140
oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water,

4307
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:32,760
all things disgusting,

4308
02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:34,460
so is every part of life

4309
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:35,220
and everything.

4310
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:37,480
Lucilla saw Verus die,

4311
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:38,860
and then Lucilla died.

4312
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:41,200
Secunda saw Maximus die,

4313
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:42,700
and then Secunda died.

4314
02:42:45,010 --> 02:42:46,950
Epitensionist saw Diotimus die,

4315
02:42:47,070 --> 02:42:48,470
and Epitensionist died.

4316
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:55,810
Such is everything.

4317
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:58,300
Seller saw Hadrian die,

4318
02:42:58,340 --> 02:42:59,660
and then Seller died,

4319
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,580
all ephemeral, dead long ago.

4320
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,120
Some indeed have not been remembered

4321
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:10,580
even for a short time,

4322
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:11,940
and others have become

4323
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:13,120
the heroes of fables,

4324
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:15,080
and again others have disappeared

4325
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:16,160
even from fables.

4326
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:18,380
Remember this then,

4327
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:20,460
that this little compound,

4328
02:43:20,860 --> 02:43:23,120
thy self, must either be dissolved,

4329
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:24,740
or thy poor breath

4330
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:25,920
must be extinguished,

4331
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:27,220
or be removed

4332
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:28,340
and placed elsewhere.

4333
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,960
It is satisfaction to a man

4334
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,980
to do the proper works of a man.

4335
02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:35,920
Now it is a proper work of a man

4336
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:38,720
to be in benevolent to his own kind,

4337
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:41,320
to despise the movements of the senses,

4338
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:43,680
to form a just judgment

4339
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:45,020
of plausible appearances,

4340
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:46,340
and to take a survey

4341
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:47,900
of the nature of the universe

4342
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:50,240
and of the things which happen in it.

4343
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:51,840
There are three relations

4344
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,680
between thee and other things,

4345
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:55,000
the one to the body

4346
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,120
which surrounds thee,

4347
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:58,380
the second to the divine cause

4348
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:00,440
from which all things come to all,

4349
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:02,680
and the third to those who live with thee.

4350
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:05,060
Pain is either an evil to the body,

4351
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:06,380
then let the body say

4352
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:07,540
what it thinks of it,

4353
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:08,520
or to the soul.

4354
02:44:09,060 --> 02:44:10,760
But it is in the power of the soul

4355
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,440
to maintain its own serenity

4356
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:13,400
and tranquility,

4357
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,540
and not to think

4358
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,700
that pain is an evil.

4359
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:17,060
For every judgment

4360
02:44:17,060 --> 02:44:18,520
and movement and desire

4361
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,840
and aversion is within,

4362
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:22,000
and no evil ascends so high.

4363
02:44:23,050 --> 02:44:24,510
Wipe out thy imaginations

4364
02:44:24,510 --> 02:44:26,110
by often saying to thyself,

4365
02:44:26,350 --> 02:44:28,430
Now it is in my power

4366
02:44:28,430 --> 02:44:30,770
to let no badness be in this soul,

4367
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:32,810
nor desire,

4368
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:35,380
nor any perturbation at all.

4369
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:41,820
Remember this power

4370
02:44:41,820 --> 02:44:43,580
which thou hast from nature.

4371
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:47,240
Speak both in the Senate

4372
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:48,340
and to every man,

4373
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:49,500
whoever he may be,

4374
02:44:49,740 --> 02:44:50,160
appropriately,

4375
02:44:50,380 --> 02:44:51,820
not with any affectation,

4376
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:53,300
use plain discourse.

4377
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:55,370
Augustus's court,

4378
02:44:55,790 --> 02:44:56,910
wife, daughter,

4379
02:44:57,250 --> 02:44:59,250
descendants, ancestors, sister,

4380
02:44:59,790 --> 02:45:01,370
Agrippa, kinsmen,

4381
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:03,130
intimates, friends,

4382
02:45:03,130 --> 02:45:04,650
Aureus, Messinus,

4383
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:07,470
physicians and sacrificing priests,

4384
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:09,410
the whole court is.

4385
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:10,950
Then turn to the rest,

4386
02:45:11,370 --> 02:45:12,690
not considering the death

4387
02:45:12,690 --> 02:45:13,750
of a single man,

4388
02:45:14,270 --> 02:45:15,470
but of a whole race,

4389
02:45:15,770 --> 02:45:16,730
as of the Pompeii,

4390
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:18,870
and that which is inscribed

4391
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:19,770
on the tombs,

4392
02:45:20,010 --> 02:45:21,410
the last of his race.

4393
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:23,350
Then consider what trouble

4394
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:24,890
those before them have had

4395
02:45:24,890 --> 02:45:26,630
that they might leave a successor.

4396
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:29,210
And then, that of necessity,

4397
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:30,930
some one must be the last.

4398
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:32,410
Again here,

4399
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:34,670
consider the death of a whole race.

4400
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:36,920
In it is thy duty

4401
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,480
to order thy life well

4402
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:39,840
in every single act,

4403
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:41,860
and if every act does its duty

4404
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:43,180
as far as is possible,

4405
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:44,260
be content,

4406
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:46,440
and no one is able to hinder thee

4407
02:45:46,440 --> 02:45:47,680
so that each act

4408
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,000
shall not do its duty.

4409
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:50,840
But something external

4410
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:52,300
will stand in the way.

4411
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:54,380
Nothing will stand in the way

4412
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:55,960
of thy acting justly,

4413
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:56,960
and soberly,

4414
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:57,860
and considerately.

4415
02:45:58,770 --> 02:46:00,970
But perhaps some other act of power

4416
02:46:00,970 --> 02:46:02,030
will be hindered.

4417
02:46:02,030 --> 02:46:05,050
Well, but, by acquiescing

4418
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:05,930
in the hindrance,

4419
02:46:06,210 --> 02:46:07,350
and by being content

4420
02:46:07,350 --> 02:46:08,690
to transfer thy efforts

4421
02:46:08,690 --> 02:46:09,990
to that which is allowed,

4422
02:46:10,450 --> 02:46:11,970
another opportunity of action

4423
02:46:11,970 --> 02:46:13,130
is immediately put,

4424
02:46:13,450 --> 02:46:14,450
before thee,

4425
02:46:14,610 --> 02:46:17,050
in place of that which was hindered,

4426
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:19,660
and one which will adapt itself

4427
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:20,580
to this ordering

4428
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:21,920
of which we are speaking.

4429
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:24,380
Receive wealth or prosperity

4430
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:25,360
without arrogance,

4431
02:46:29,070 --> 02:46:30,470
if thou dost ever see

4432
02:46:30,470 --> 02:46:31,590
a hand cut off,

4433
02:46:31,890 --> 02:46:32,570
or a foot,

4434
02:46:32,830 --> 02:46:33,630
or a head,

4435
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:35,290
lying anywhere apart

4436
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:36,470
from the rest of the body.

4437
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:42,360
Such does a man make himself

4438
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:43,640
as far as he can,

4439
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:45,240
who is not content

4440
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:46,100
with what happens

4441
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,900
and separates himself from others,

4442
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:49,640
or does anything unsocial.

4443
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:52,020
Suppose that thou hast

4444
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:53,140
detached thyself

4445
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:54,560
from the natural unity,

4446
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:57,820
for thou wast made by nature apart.

4447
02:47:02,830 --> 02:47:04,090
God has allowed this

4448
02:47:04,090 --> 02:47:05,070
to no other part,

4449
02:47:05,450 --> 02:47:06,790
after it has been separated

4450
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:07,810
and cut asunder,

4451
02:47:08,190 --> 02:47:09,530
to come together again.

4452
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:11,290
But consider the kindness

4453
02:47:11,290 --> 02:47:13,170
by which he has distinguished man,

4454
02:47:13,450 --> 02:47:15,290
for he has put it in his power

4455
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:17,250
not to be separated at all

4456
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:18,170
from the universal,

4457
02:47:18,490 --> 02:47:20,110
and when he has been separated,

4458
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:22,050
he has allowed him to return

4459
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:23,210
and to be united

4460
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:25,310
and to resume his place.

4461
02:47:25,930 --> 02:47:27,690
As the nature of the universal

4462
02:47:27,690 --> 02:47:29,690
has given to every rational being

4463
02:47:29,690 --> 02:47:31,750
all the other powers that it has,

4464
02:47:32,250 --> 02:47:33,750
so we have received from it

4465
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:35,010
this power also.

4466
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:37,470
For as the universal nature

4467
02:47:37,470 --> 02:47:38,810
converts and fixes

4468
02:47:38,810 --> 02:47:41,370
in its impredestined place,

4469
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:45,650
everything which stands in the way

4470
02:47:45,650 --> 02:47:46,510
and opposes it,

4471
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:48,540
and makes such things

4472
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:49,480
a part of itself,

4473
02:47:50,410 --> 02:47:52,110
so also the rational animal

4474
02:47:52,110 --> 02:47:54,630
is able to make every hindrance

4475
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:55,690
its own material,

4476
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:57,930
and to use it for such purposes

4477
02:47:57,930 --> 02:47:59,550
as it may have designed,

4478
02:48:00,030 --> 02:48:01,370
do not disturb thyself

4479
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:03,690
by thinking of the whole of thy life.

4480
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:06,100
Let not thy thoughts at once

4481
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:07,860
embrace all the various troubles

4482
02:48:07,860 --> 02:48:09,200
which thou mayst expect

4483
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:10,060
to befall thee,

4484
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:12,160
but on every occasion

4485
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:13,360
ask thyself,

4486
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:15,460
What is there in this

4487
02:48:15,460 --> 02:48:16,660
which is intolerable

4488
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:17,940
and past-bearing?

4489
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:20,300
For thou wilt be ashamed to confess.

4490
02:48:20,820 --> 02:48:21,860
In the next place,

4491
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:23,700
remember that neither the future

4492
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:25,440
nor the past pains thee,

4493
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:26,800
but only the present.

4494
02:48:27,380 --> 02:48:29,420
But this is reduced to a very little,

4495
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:31,740
if thou only circumscribest it,

4496
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,300
and chidest thy mind,

4497
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:35,200
if it is unable to hold out

4498
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:36,220
against even this.

4499
02:48:36,660 --> 02:48:38,880
Does panthea or pergamos

4500
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:40,540
now sit by the tomb of Verus?

4501
02:48:41,060 --> 02:48:43,020
Does sureus or diatomus

4502
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:44,320
sit by the tomb of Hadrian?

4503
02:48:45,060 --> 02:48:46,160
That would be ridiculous.

4504
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:49,360
Well, suppose they did sit there,

4505
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:51,220
would the dead be conscious of it?

4506
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:52,900
And if the dead were conscious,

4507
02:48:53,360 --> 02:48:54,440
would they be pleased?

4508
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:56,160
And if they were pleased,

4509
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:58,200
would that make them immortal?

4510
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:01,040
Was it not in the order of destiny

4511
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,580
that these persons too

4512
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:04,240
should first become old women

4513
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:05,260
and old men,

4514
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:06,380
and then die?

4515
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:08,040
What then would those do

4516
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,300
after these were dead?

4517
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:12,160
All this is foul smell and blood in a bag.

4518
02:49:13,240 --> 02:49:14,580
If thou canst see sharp,

4519
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:16,360
look and judge wisely,

4520
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:17,460
says the philosopher.

4521
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:20,740
In the constitution of the rational animal,

4522
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:23,560
I see no virtue which is opposed to justice,

4523
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:25,600
but I see a virtue which is opposed

4524
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:26,600
to love of pleasure,

4525
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:28,540
and that is temperance.

4526
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:31,040
If thou takest away thy opinion

4527
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,640
about that which appears to give thee pain,

4528
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:37,660
thou thyself standest in imperfect security.

4529
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:41,340
Who is this self?

4530
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,920
The reason.

4531
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,300
But if any other part of thee suffers,

4532
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:50,320
let it have its own opinion about itself,

4533
02:49:54,190 --> 02:49:57,390
and something else also is equally an impediment

4534
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:59,950
and an evil to the constitution of plans.

4535
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:03,730
So then, that which is a hindrance

4536
02:50:03,730 --> 02:50:05,870
to the intelligence is an evil

4537
02:50:05,870 --> 02:50:07,250
to the intelligent nature.

4538
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:14,140
Does pain or sensuous pleasure affect thee?

4539
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:16,720
The senses will look to that.

4540
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:25,760
If, indeed, thou wast making this effort,

4541
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:28,200
absolutely, unconditionally,

4542
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:29,820
or without any reservation,

4543
02:50:30,380 --> 02:50:32,300
certainly this obstacle is an evil

4544
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:34,460
to thee considered as a rational animal.

4545
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:36,800
But if thou takest into consideration

4546
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,600
the usual course of things,

4547
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:40,840
thou hast not yet been injured,

4548
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,300
nor even impeded.

4549
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:50,080
When it has been made a sphere,

4550
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:51,960
it continues a sphere.

4551
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:55,830
It is not fit that I should give myself pain,

4552
02:50:56,030 --> 02:50:58,490
for I have never intentionally given pain

4553
02:50:58,490 --> 02:50:59,430
even to another.

4554
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:02,720
Different things delight different people,

4555
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,600
but it is my delight to keep

4556
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,060
the ruling faculty sound,

4557
02:51:06,440 --> 02:51:08,620
without turning away either from any man

4558
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:10,180
or from any of the things

4559
02:51:10,180 --> 02:51:11,160
which happen to men.

4560
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:13,900
But looking at, and receiving all

4561
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:16,320
with welcome eyes, and using everything

4562
02:51:16,320 --> 02:51:17,700
according to its value,

4563
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:20,760
see that thou secure this present time

4564
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:21,640
to thyself.

4565
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,560
For those who rather pursue posthumous fame,

4566
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:27,900
do consider that the men of after time

4567
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:30,480
will be exactly and such as these

4568
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:32,200
whom they cannot bear now.

4569
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:36,160
And what is it in any way to thee

4570
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,780
if these men of after time

4571
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:39,240
utter this or that sound,

4572
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:41,740
or have this or that opinion about thee?

4573
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:46,500
Take me and cast me where thou wilt,

4574
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:49,240
for there I shall keep my divine part tranquil,

4575
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:50,700
that is, content,

4576
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:52,920
if it can feel and act conformably

4577
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:54,340
to its proper constitution.

4578
02:51:54,580 --> 02:51:56,220
Is this change of place?

4579
02:51:59,960 --> 02:52:01,780
Nothing can happen to any man

4580
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:03,360
which is not a human accident,

4581
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:05,700
nor to an ox which is not according

4582
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:07,040
to the nature of an ox,

4583
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:09,100
nor to a vine which is not,

4584
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:11,220
according to the nature of a vine,

4585
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:14,320
nor to a stone which is not proper to a stone.

4586
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:17,140
If, then, there happens to each thing,

4587
02:52:17,340 --> 02:52:19,440
both what is usual and natural,

4588
02:52:19,880 --> 02:52:21,420
why shouldst thou complain?

4589
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:24,000
For the common nature brings nothing,

4590
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:25,780
which may not be borne by thee.

4591
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:28,780
If thou art pained by any external thing,

4592
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:31,120
it is not this thing that disturbs thee,

4593
02:52:31,380 --> 02:52:33,080
but thy own judgment about it.

4594
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:37,360
And it is in thy power to wipe out this judgment now.

4595
02:52:37,780 --> 02:52:40,880
But if anything in thy own disposition gives thee pain,

4596
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:43,640
who hinders thee from correcting thy opinion?

4597
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:46,100
And even if thou art pained,

4598
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:48,460
because thou art not doing some particular thing,

4599
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:50,160
which seems to thee to be right,

4600
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:53,200
why dost thou not rather act than complain?

4601
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:56,180
But some insuperable obstacle is in the way.

4602
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:57,860
Do not be grieved, then,

4603
02:52:57,860 --> 02:52:59,560
for the cause of its not being done

4604
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:00,800
depends not on thee.

4605
02:53:01,410 --> 02:53:03,230
But it is not worth while to live

4606
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:04,490
if this cannot be done.

4607
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:07,650
Take thy departure, then, from life contentedly,

4608
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:09,850
just as he dies who is in full activity,

4609
02:53:10,050 --> 02:53:12,570
and well pleased too with the things which are obstacles.

4610
02:53:13,050 --> 02:53:16,210
Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible,

4611
02:53:16,810 --> 02:53:20,650
when and self-collected it is satisfied with itself,

4612
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:24,570
if it does nothing, which it does not choose to do,

4613
02:53:24,830 --> 02:53:27,630
even if it resists from mere obstinancy.

4614
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:32,200
What, then, will it be when it forms a judgment

4615
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:35,540
about anything aided by reason and deliberately?

4616
02:53:36,220 --> 02:53:39,600
Therefore the mind which is free from passions is a citadel,

4617
02:53:40,040 --> 02:53:42,860
for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly.

4618
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:49,700
Say nothing more to thyself

4619
02:53:49,700 --> 02:53:51,960
than what the first appearances report.

4620
02:53:58,070 --> 02:54:00,190
I see that my child is sick.

4621
02:54:00,670 --> 02:54:04,350
I do see, but that he is in danger I do not see.

4622
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:09,920
Cucumber is bitter.

4623
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:11,740
Throw it away.

4624
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:14,120
There are briars in the road.

4625
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:15,880
Turn aside from them.

4626
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:17,200
This is enough.

4627
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:22,140
Do not add, and why were such things made in the world?

4628
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:26,470
For thou wilt be ridiculed by a man who is acquainted with nature,

4629
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:30,010
as thou wouldst be ridiculed by a carpenter and shoemaker,

4630
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:34,440
if thou didst find fault because thou seest in their workshop.

4631
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,800
Shavings and cuttings from the things which they make.

4632
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:40,420
You need to add some text for me to talk,

4633
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:42,660
and yet they have places into which

4634
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:44,960
they can throw these shavings and cuttings,

4635
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:47,720
and the universal nature has no external space.

4636
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:52,360
But the wondrous part of her art is that though she has circumscribed herself,

4637
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:57,020
everything within her which appears to decay and to grow old and to be useless,

4638
02:54:57,380 --> 02:55:01,400
she changes into herself and again makes other new things from.

4639
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:06,320
These vary same, so that she requires neither substance from without,

4640
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:10,360
nor wants a place into which she may cast not which decays.

4641
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:16,200
She is content then with her own space and her own matter and her own art.

4642
02:55:20,460 --> 02:55:24,300
Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee.

4643
02:55:25,310 --> 02:55:28,870
What then can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure,

4644
02:55:29,270 --> 02:55:30,890
wise, sober, just?

4645
02:55:31,310 --> 02:55:36,730
For instance, if a man should stand by a limpid pure spring and curse it,

4646
02:55:36,970 --> 02:55:39,470
the spring never ceases sending up potable water,

4647
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:45,430
and if he should cast clay into it or filth, it will speedily disperse them

4648
02:55:45,430 --> 02:55:48,390
and wash them out and will not be at all polluted.

4649
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:54,430
How then shalt thou possess a perpetual fountain and not a mere well?

4650
02:55:55,650 --> 02:56:01,570
By forming thyself hourly to freedom, conjoined with contentment, simplicity,

4651
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:06,450
and modesty, he who does not know what the world is,

4652
02:56:06,450 --> 02:56:13,090
does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists,

4653
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:17,370
does not know who he is, nor what the world is.

4654
02:56:21,610 --> 02:56:26,750
But he who has failed in any one of these things could not even say for what purpose he

4655
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:32,250
exists himself. What then dost thou think of him who avoids or seeks the praise of those

4656
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:37,490
who applaud, of men who know not either where they are or who they are?

4657
02:56:41,650 --> 02:56:46,550
Dost thou wish to be praised by a man who curses himself thrice every hour?

4658
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:50,450
Whatst thou wish to please a man who does not please himself?

4659
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:58,100
Does a man please himself who repents of nearly everything that he does?

4660
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:04,020
No longer let thy breathing, only act in concert with the air which surrounds thee,

4661
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:08,700
but let thy intelligence also now be in harmony with the nine intelligence

4662
02:57:08,700 --> 02:57:14,580
which embraces all things, for the intelligent power is no less diffused in all parts

4663
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:18,880
and pervades all things for him who is willing to draw it to him

4664
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:22,580
than the aerial power for him who is able to respire it.

4665
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:26,440
Generally wickedness does no harm at all to the universe,

4666
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:30,460
and particularly the wickedness of one man does no harm to another.

4667
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:35,360
It is only harmful to him who has it in his power to be released from it

4668
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:43,400
as soon as he shall choose. To my own free will,

4669
02:57:43,720 --> 02:57:48,040
the free will of my neighbor is just as indifferent as his poor breath and flesh.

4670
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:51,720
For though we are made especially for the sake of one another,

4671
02:57:52,530 --> 02:57:56,510
still the ruling power of each of us has its own office.

4672
02:57:59,440 --> 02:58:03,940
The sun appears to be poured down, and in all directions indeed it is diffused,

4673
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:08,760
yet it is not effused. For this diffusion is extension.

4674
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:12,960
Accordingly its rays are called extensions because they are extended.

4675
02:58:13,580 --> 02:58:15,800
You need to add some text for me to talk.

4676
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:21,840
But one may judge what kind of a thing a ray is if he looks at the sun's light

4677
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:27,380
passing through a narrow opening into a darkened room, for it is extended in a right line,

4678
02:58:27,580 --> 02:58:31,340
and as it were is divided when it meets with any solid body

4679
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:34,440
which stands in the way and intercepts the air beyond.

4680
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:43,430
But there, the light remains fixed. Such, then, ought to be the outpouring

4681
02:58:43,430 --> 02:58:48,370
and diffusion of the understanding, and it should in no way be an effusion,

4682
02:58:48,770 --> 02:58:53,230
but an extension, and it should make no violent or impetuous collision

4683
02:58:53,230 --> 02:58:57,570
with the obstacles which are in its way nor yet fall down,

4684
02:58:58,070 --> 02:59:01,930
but be fixed, and enlighten that which receives it.

4685
02:59:02,130 --> 02:59:08,050
For a body will deprive itself of the illumination if it does not admit it.

4686
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:17,290
Ye who fears death either fears the loss of sensation, or a different kind of sensation,

4687
02:59:17,630 --> 02:59:21,390
or a different kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no sensation,

4688
02:59:21,770 --> 02:59:26,070
neither wilt thou feel any harm, and if thou shalt acquire another kind of sensation,

4689
02:59:26,490 --> 02:59:29,210
thou wilt be a different kind of living being, and thou wilt.

4690
02:59:29,990 --> 02:59:38,200
Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them, then, or bear with them.

4691
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:43,540
In one way an arrow moves, in another way the mind.

4692
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:53,120
The mind indeed, both when it exercises caution, and when it is employed about inquiry,

4693
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:56,880
moves straight onward, not the less, and to its object.

4694
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:06,200
Enter into every man's ruling faculty, and also let every other man enter into thine.

4695
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:11,230
Book 9. He who acts unjustly acts impiously.

4696
03:00:11,770 --> 03:00:16,570
For since the universal nature has made rational animals, for the sake of one another,

4697
03:00:16,710 --> 03:00:23,570
to help one another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another,

4698
03:00:23,750 --> 03:00:31,760
he who transgresses her will, and he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity.

4699
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:35,700
For the universal nature is the nature of things that are,

4700
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:40,500
and things that are, have a relation to all things that come into existence.

4701
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:45,820
And further, you need to add some text for me to talk.

4702
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:53,180
He then who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving.

4703
03:00:56,550 --> 03:01:01,490
To truth, for he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not

4704
03:01:01,490 --> 03:01:08,210
able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed, he who pursues pleasure as good,

4705
03:01:08,210 --> 03:01:15,750
and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find

4706
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:21,870
fault with the universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good,

4707
03:01:22,490 --> 03:01:28,590
contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure,

4708
03:01:29,370 --> 03:01:35,270
and possess the things which procure. Pleasure, but the good have pain for their share,

4709
03:01:35,270 --> 03:01:42,310
and the things which cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be

4710
03:01:42,310 --> 03:01:47,050
afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and even this is impiety.

4711
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:54,260
And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety.

4712
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:59,840
Now with respect to the things towards which the universal nature is equally affected,

4713
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:04,660
for it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards both.

4714
03:02:05,830 --> 03:02:11,530
Towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it and equally

4715
03:02:11,530 --> 03:02:17,760
affected. You need to add some text for me to talk. And I say that the universal nature

4716
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:22,780
employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to those who are produced

4717
03:02:22,780 --> 03:02:28,440
in continuous series, and to those who come after them by virtue of a certain original

4718
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:33,680
movement of providence, according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering

4719
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:43,020
of things, principles of the things which were to be, and having determined powers productive

4720
03:02:43,020 --> 03:02:48,740
of beings and of changes and of such like successions. With respect to pain then,

4721
03:02:48,860 --> 03:02:54,020
and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature

4722
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:59,360
employs equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously.

4723
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:05,100
It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from mankind without having had any taste of lying

4724
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:10,980
and hypocrisy and luxury and pride. However to breathe out one's life when a man has had enough

4725
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:15,080
of these things, is the next best voyage, as the saying is.

4726
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:33,400
Has the saying is, I asked, the saying is, the saying is, yet induced thee to fly from

4727
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:39,260
this pestilence. For the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence, much more indeed

4728
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:44,220
than any such corruption and change of this atmosphere which surrounds us.

4729
03:03:45,850 --> 03:03:55,040
For this corruption is a pestilence of animals, so far as they are animals. Do not despise death,

4730
03:03:55,520 --> 03:04:00,370
but be well content with it, since this too is one of those things which nature wills.

4731
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:06,700
For such as it is to be young and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity,

4732
03:04:07,280 --> 03:04:14,560
and to have teeth and beard and grey hairs, and to beget and to be pregnant and to bring forth

4733
03:04:15,300 --> 03:04:18,420
and all the other natural operations which the seasons of.

4734
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:25,880
This, then, is consistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be neither careless nor

4735
03:04:25,880 --> 03:04:37,620
impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death, but to wait for it. As thou now waitest

4736
03:04:37,620 --> 03:04:42,460
for the time when the child shall come out of thy wise womb, so be ready for the time

4737
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:48,560
when thy soul shall fall out of this. But if thou requires also a vulgar kind of comfort

4738
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:54,140
which shall reach thy heart, thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing

4739
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:59,940
the objects from which thou art going to be removed, and the morals of those with whom

4740
03:04:59,940 --> 03:05:04,820
thy soul will no longer be mingled. For it is no way right to be offended with men,

4741
03:05:04,820 --> 03:05:10,680
but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them gently, and yet to remember that thy

4742
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:16,880
departure will be not from men who have the same principles as thyself. For this is the

4743
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:23,060
only thing, if there be any, which could draw us the contrary way and attach us to life,

4744
03:05:23,320 --> 03:05:27,760
to be permitted to live with those who have the same principles as ourselves.

4745
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:33,580
But now thou seest how great is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who

4746
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:39,800
live together, so that thou mayest say, Come quick, O death, lest perchance I,

4747
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:47,260
in A who does wrong does wrong against himself, he who acts unjustly acts unjustly to himself

4748
03:05:47,260 --> 03:05:55,730
because he makes himself bad. He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing,

4749
03:05:56,030 --> 03:06:01,010
not only he who does a certain thing, thy present opinion founded on understanding,

4750
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:07,940
and thy present conduct directed to social good, and thy present disposition of contentment

4751
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:24,500
with everything which happens, that is enough. Check desire. Extinguish appetite.

4752
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:30,310
Keep the ruling faculty in its own power. You need to add some text for me to talk,

4753
03:06:30,770 --> 03:06:37,600
among the animals which have not reason. One life is distributed, but among reasonable

4754
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:45,540
animals one intelligent soul is distributed. Just as there is one earth of all things which

4755
03:06:45,540 --> 03:06:54,370
are of an earthy nature, and we see by one light and breathe one air, all things which

4756
03:06:54,370 --> 03:07:00,470
participate in anything which is common to them all move towards that which is of the same kind

4757
03:07:00,470 --> 03:07:06,580
with themselves. Everything which is earthy turns towards the earth. Everything which is liquid

4758
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:13,500
flows together, and everything which is of an aerial kind does the same so that they require

4759
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:19,800
something to keep them asunder, and the fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental

4760
03:07:19,800 --> 03:07:25,980
fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here

4761
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:34,730
that even every substance which is somewhat dry is easily ignited because there is less mingled

4762
03:07:34,730 --> 03:07:41,720
with it, of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then, everything also

4763
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:47,640
which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like manner towards that which

4764
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:54,630
is of the same kind with itself, or moves even more. For so much, as it is superior

4765
03:07:54,630 --> 03:08:00,350
in comparison with all other end things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle

4766
03:08:00,350 --> 03:08:06,390
and to be fused with that which is akin to it. You need to add some text for me to talk.

4767
03:08:07,110 --> 03:08:12,570
Accordingly among animals, devoid of reason, we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle,

4768
03:08:12,850 --> 03:08:17,870
and the nurture of young birds, and in a manner loves, for even in animals there are souls,

4769
03:08:18,230 --> 03:08:23,290
and that power which brings them together is seen to exert itself in the superior degree,

4770
03:08:23,570 --> 03:08:27,170
and in such a way as never has been observed in plants, nor in stones,

4771
03:08:29,770 --> 03:08:34,170
but in rational animals there are political communities, and friendships,

4772
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:44,440
and families, and meetings of people. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce

4773
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:53,510
a sympathy even in things which are separated, but still though men strive to avoid this union,

4774
03:08:53,950 --> 03:08:57,630
they are caught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them,

4775
03:08:57,630 --> 03:09:01,510
and thou wilt see what I say if thou only observest.

4776
03:09:02,210 --> 03:09:07,810
Sooner then will one find anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing

4777
03:09:07,810 --> 03:09:13,570
than a man altogether separated from other men. Both man and God, and the universe,

4778
03:09:14,090 --> 03:09:19,890
produce fruit. At the proper seasons each produces it. But if usage has especially

4779
03:09:19,890 --> 03:09:26,290
fixed these terms to the vine and like things, this is nothing. Reason produces

4780
03:09:26,290 --> 03:09:31,430
fruit both for all and for itself, and there are produced from it other things of the same kind

4781
03:09:31,430 --> 03:09:37,630
as reason itself, if thou art able, correct by teaching those who do wrong. But if thou

4782
03:09:37,630 --> 03:09:48,300
canst not, remember that indulgence is given to thee for this purpose. And the gods, too,

4783
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:53,300
are indulgent to such persons, and for some purposes they even help them to get health,

4784
03:09:53,300 --> 03:10:03,020
wealth, reputation. So kind they are, and it is in nenthy power also, or say, who hinders thee.

4785
03:10:06,570 --> 03:10:13,350
Today I have got out of all trouble, or rather I have cast out all trouble, for it was not

4786
03:10:13,350 --> 03:10:20,610
outside, but within, and in my opinions. All things are the same, familiar in experience,

4787
03:10:20,610 --> 03:10:26,670
and ephemeral in time, and worthless in the matter. Everything now is just as it was in

4788
03:10:26,670 --> 03:10:33,520
the time of those whom we have buried. Things stand outside of us, themselves, by themselves,

4789
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:37,480
neither knowing aught of themselves, nor expressing any judgment.

4790
03:10:40,950 --> 03:10:47,370
The ruling faculty. Not in passivity, but in activity, lie the evil and the good of the

4791
03:10:47,370 --> 03:10:54,870
social animal, just as his virtue and his vice lie not in passivity, but in activity.

4792
03:10:58,820 --> 03:11:05,100
Penetrate inwards, into men's leading principles, and thou wilt see what judges

4793
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:15,400
thou art afraid of, and what kind of judges they are of themselves. It is thy duty to leave

4794
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:22,200
another man's wrongful act there where it is, on termination of activity, cessation from

4795
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:29,460
movement and opinion, and, in a sense, their death is no evil. Turn thy thoughts now to

4796
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:35,980
the consideration of thy life, thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old age,

4797
03:11:36,360 --> 03:11:43,660
for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything to fear? Turn thy thoughts now

4798
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:49,180
to thy life under thy grandfather, then to thy life under thy mother, then to thy life

4799
03:11:49,180 --> 03:11:59,940
under thy father. You need to add some text for me to talk. Hasten to examine thy own

4800
03:11:59,940 --> 03:12:05,680
ruling faculty, and that of the universe, and that of thy neighbor, thy own, that thou

4801
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:15,760
mayest make it just. In like manner, then, neither are the termination and cessation and

4802
03:12:15,760 --> 03:12:25,510
change of thy whole life a thing to be afraid of. As thou thyself art a component,

4803
03:12:25,790 --> 03:12:31,250
part of a social system, so let every act of thine be a component part of social life.

4804
03:12:31,270 --> 03:12:37,950
Whatever act of thine, then, has no reference either immediately or remotely to a social end.

4805
03:12:38,470 --> 03:12:43,470
This tears asunder thy life, and does not allow it to be one, and it is of the nature

4806
03:12:43,470 --> 03:12:49,110
of a mutiny. Just as when in a popular assembly a man acting by himself stands

4807
03:12:49,110 --> 03:12:54,550
apart from the general agreement, quarrels of little children, and their sports,

4808
03:12:54,550 --> 03:13:01,650
and poor spirits, carrying about dead bodies, such as everything. And so what is exhibited

4809
03:13:01,650 --> 03:13:06,870
in the representation of the mansions of the dead strikes our eyes more clearly.

4810
03:13:07,790 --> 03:13:13,770
Examine into the quality of the form of an object, nand, detach it altogether from its

4811
03:13:13,770 --> 03:13:20,190
material part, and then contemplate it, then determine the time, the longest, which a thing

4812
03:13:20,190 --> 03:13:26,270
of this peculiar form is naturally made to endure. Thou hast endured infinite troubles

4813
03:13:26,270 --> 03:13:31,310
through not being contented with thy ruling faculty, when it does the things which it is

4814
03:13:31,310 --> 03:13:39,450
constituted by nature to do. But enough of this. When another blames thee or hates thee,

4815
03:13:39,790 --> 03:13:44,490
or when men say about thee anything injurious, approach their poor souls,

4816
03:13:44,790 --> 03:13:49,890
penetrate within, and see what kind of men they are, thou wilt discover that there is

4817
03:13:49,890 --> 03:13:56,390
no reason to take any trouble, that these men may have this or that opinion about thee.

4818
03:13:57,490 --> 03:14:02,070
However thou must be well disposed towards them, for by nature they are friends,

4819
03:14:02,610 --> 03:14:09,170
and the gods too aid them in all ways, by dreams, by signs, towards the attainment of

4820
03:14:09,170 --> 03:14:16,350
those things on which they set a value. You need to add some text for me to talk.

4821
03:14:16,930 --> 03:14:21,750
And either the universal intelligence puts itself in motion for every separate effect,

4822
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:27,270
and if this is so, be thou content with that which is the result of its activity,

4823
03:14:27,870 --> 03:14:33,010
or it puts itself in motion once, and everything else comes by way of sequence in a manner.

4824
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:42,820
In a word, if there is a god, all is well, and if chance rules, do not thou also be

4825
03:14:42,820 --> 03:14:48,550
governed by it. Soon will the earth cover us all, then the earth too will change,

4826
03:14:49,130 --> 03:14:53,230
and the things also which result from change will continue to change forever.

4827
03:14:55,690 --> 03:14:59,710
For if a man reflects on the changes and transformations which follow one another,

4828
03:14:59,990 --> 03:15:05,350
like wave after wave, and their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.

4829
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:13,160
But how worthless are all these poor people who are engaged in matters political,

4830
03:15:13,320 --> 03:15:19,300
and, as they suppose, are playing the philosopher, all drivelers! Well then,

4831
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:25,740
man, do what nature now requires. Set thyself in motion, if it is in thy power,

4832
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:31,360
and do not look about thee to see if any one will observe it, nor yet expect Plato's Republic,

4833
03:15:31,700 --> 03:15:38,600
but be content, if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an event to be

4834
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:47,460
no small matter, for who can change men's opinions? And without a change of opinions,

4835
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:53,260
what else is there than the slavery of men who groan while they pretend to obey?

4836
03:16:04,010 --> 03:16:08,730
They themselves shall judge whether they discovered what the common nature required,

4837
03:16:09,190 --> 03:16:15,550
and trained themselves accordingly. But if they acted like tragedy heroes,

4838
03:16:15,970 --> 03:16:20,550
no one has condemned me to imitate them. Simple and modest is the work of philosophy.

4839
03:16:21,350 --> 03:16:27,600
Draw me not aside to indolence and pride. Look down from above on the countless herds of men

4840
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:33,720
and their countless solemnities, and the infinitely varied voyagings in storms and calms,

4841
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:40,120
and the differences among those who are born, who live together and die. You need to add some

4842
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:46,840
text for me to talk. And consider, too, the life lived by others in olden time, and the life of

4843
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:54,050
those who will live after thee, and the life now lived among barbarous nations, and how many

4844
03:16:54,050 --> 03:17:01,020
know not even thy name, and how many will soon forget it, and how they who perhaps now are

4845
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:07,060
praising thee will very soon blame thee, and that neither apostumous name is of any.

4846
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:12,540
Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things which come from the

4847
03:17:12,540 --> 03:17:26,870
external cause. Let there be justice, destrest, my end, birth to dissolution,

4848
03:17:27,130 --> 03:17:32,350
and the illimitable time before birth, as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution.

4849
03:17:32,350 --> 03:17:39,130
All that thou seest will quickly perish, and those who have been spectators of its dissolution

4850
03:17:39,130 --> 03:17:49,050
will very soon perish, too. And he who dies at the extremist old age will be brought into

4851
03:17:49,050 --> 03:17:54,770
the same condition with him who died prematurely. What are these men's leading principles,

4852
03:17:55,050 --> 03:18:00,230
and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love

4853
03:18:00,230 --> 03:18:07,640
and honor? Imagine that thou seest their poor souls laid bare. When they think that

4854
03:18:07,640 --> 03:18:14,300
they do harm by their blame, or good by their praise, what an idea! Loss is nothing else

4855
03:18:14,300 --> 03:18:22,640
than change. But the universal nature delights in change. And, in obedience to her, all things

4856
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:28,800
are now done well, and from eternity have been done in like form, and will be such to time

4857
03:18:28,800 --> 03:18:35,510
without end. What then dost thou say? That all things have been, and all things always will be

4858
03:18:35,510 --> 03:18:41,910
bad, and that no power has ever been found in so many gods to rectify these things. But the

4859
03:18:41,910 --> 03:18:48,660
world has been condemned to be found in never ceasing evil. The rottenness of the matter,

4860
03:18:48,880 --> 03:18:56,840
which is the foundation of everything, water, dust, bones, filth, or again marble rocks,

4861
03:18:56,840 --> 03:19:06,500
the colossities of the earth, and gold and silver, the sediments and garments, only bits of hair,

4862
03:19:09,270 --> 03:19:19,140
and that which is of the nature of end-breath. What unsettles thee? Is it the form of the

4863
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:26,230
thing? Look at it. Or is it the matter? Look at it. But besides these there is nothing.

4864
03:19:29,880 --> 03:19:35,780
Towards the gods, then, now become at last more simple and better. It is the same whether we

4865
03:19:35,780 --> 03:19:42,840
examine these things for a hundred years or three. If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own.

4866
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:49,200
But perhaps he has not done wrong. Either all things proceed from one intelligence source

4867
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:54,240
and come together as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is

4868
03:19:54,240 --> 03:19:59,610
done for the benefit of the whole, or there are only atoms and nothing else than mixture

4869
03:19:59,610 --> 03:20:07,610
and dispersion. Why, then, art thou disturbed? Say to the ruling faculty. Art thou dead?

4870
03:20:08,010 --> 03:20:14,130
Art thou corrupted? Art thou plain a hypocrite? Art thou become a beast? Dost thou herd and

4871
03:20:14,130 --> 03:20:20,480
feed with the rest? If, then, they have no power, why dost thou pray to them? But if

4872
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:25,140
they have power, why dost thou not pray for them to give thee the faculty of not fearing

4873
03:20:25,140 --> 03:20:29,740
any of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the things which thou

4874
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:34,560
desirest, or not being pained at anything, rather than pray that any of these things

4875
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:40,060
should not happen? Or, for certainly, if they can cooperate with men, they can cooperate

4876
03:20:40,060 --> 03:20:46,470
for these purposes. But perhaps thou wilt say, The gods have placed them in thy power.

4877
03:20:47,530 --> 03:20:52,330
Well, then, is it not better to use what is in thy power like a free man,

4878
03:20:53,390 --> 03:20:59,650
than to desire in a slavish and abject way? What is not in thy power, and who has told

4879
03:20:59,650 --> 03:21:04,490
thee that the gods do not aid us even in the things in which are in our power?

4880
03:21:06,910 --> 03:21:10,930
Do thou pray thus, How shall I not desire to lie with her?

4881
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:15,020
Another prays thus, How shall I be released from this?

4882
03:21:16,250 --> 03:21:19,650
Another prays, How shall I not desire to be released?

4883
03:21:20,350 --> 03:21:23,190
Another thus, How shall I not lose my little son?

4884
03:21:24,390 --> 03:21:27,410
Thou thus, How shall I not be afraid to lose him?

4885
03:21:27,410 --> 03:21:31,790
You need to add some text for me to talk. Epicurus says,

4886
03:21:32,130 --> 03:21:36,730
In my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily sufferings,

4887
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:41,510
nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me.

4888
03:21:43,070 --> 03:21:46,590
But I continue to discourse on the nature of things as before.

4889
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:58,780
Keeping to this main point, Infine, turn thy prayers this way, and see what comes.

4890
03:22:03,080 --> 03:22:05,160
You need to add some text for me to talk.

4891
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:08,360
Do, then, the same that he did both in sickness.

4892
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:17,370
If thou art sick, and in any other circumstances, for never to desert philosophy

4893
03:22:17,370 --> 03:22:23,290
in any events that may befall us, nor to hold trifling talk either with an ignorant man,

4894
03:22:23,730 --> 03:22:29,500
or with one unacquainted with nature, is a principle of all schools of philosophy.

4895
03:22:31,360 --> 03:22:34,180
But to be intent only on that which thou art now,

4896
03:22:34,180 --> 03:22:38,580
doing, and on, the instrument by which thou doest it.

4897
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:44,300
When thou art offended with any man's shameless conduct, immediately ask thyself,

4898
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:48,980
Is it possible, then, that shameless men should not be in the world?

4899
03:22:53,070 --> 03:22:59,130
For this man also is one of those shameless men who must of necessity be in the world.

4900
03:23:00,060 --> 03:23:04,620
Let the same considerations be present to thy mind in the case of the knave,

4901
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:10,080
and the faithless man, and of every man who does wrong in any way.

4902
03:23:10,860 --> 03:23:15,220
For at the same time that thou dost remind thyself that it is impossible

4903
03:23:15,220 --> 03:23:20,840
that such kind of men should not exist, thou wilt become more kindly disposed

4904
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:22,640
towards every one individually.

4905
03:23:23,260 --> 03:23:28,280
It is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the occasion arises,

4906
03:23:28,600 --> 03:23:32,960
what virtue nature has given to man to oppose to every wrongful act.

4907
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:38,020
For she has given to man, as an antidote against the stupid man,

4908
03:23:38,420 --> 03:23:42,840
mildness, and against another kind of man, some other power.

4909
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:49,780
And in all cases it is possible for thee to correct,

4910
03:23:50,300 --> 03:23:52,620
by teaching the man who is gone astray.

4911
03:23:53,140 --> 03:23:57,640
For every man who errs misses his object, and is gone astray.

4912
03:23:58,880 --> 03:24:01,140
Besides, wherein hast thou been injured?

4913
03:24:01,140 --> 03:24:06,900
For thou wilt find that no one among those against whom thou art irritated

4914
03:24:06,900 --> 03:24:10,760
has done anything by which thy mind could be made worse.

4915
03:24:11,480 --> 03:24:16,260
But that which is evil to thee, and harmful, has its foundation only in the mind.

4916
03:24:16,860 --> 03:24:19,300
And what harm is done, or what is there?

4917
03:24:19,740 --> 03:24:24,840
Strange, if the man who has not been instructed does the acts of an uninstructed man.

4918
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:31,480
Consider, whether thou shouldst not rather blame thyself,

4919
03:24:31,480 --> 03:24:35,720
because thou didst not expect such a man to err in such a way.

4920
03:24:36,020 --> 03:24:38,860
For thou hast means, given thee by thy reason,

4921
03:24:39,520 --> 03:24:42,520
to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error,

4922
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:46,740
and yet thou hast forgotten, and art amazed that he has erred.

4923
03:24:53,450 --> 03:24:57,190
But most of all, when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful,

4924
03:24:57,530 --> 03:25:01,130
turn to thyself, for the fault is manifestly thy own.

4925
03:25:01,750 --> 03:25:07,050
Whether thou didst trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise.

4926
03:25:07,880 --> 03:25:12,560
Or when conferring thy kindness, thou didst not confer it absolutely,

4927
03:25:13,590 --> 03:25:18,210
nor yet in such way as to have received from thy very act all the profit.

4928
03:25:19,690 --> 03:25:23,750
For what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service?

4929
03:25:24,610 --> 03:25:29,030
Art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy nature,

4930
03:25:29,490 --> 03:25:32,610
and dost thou seek to be paid for it?

4931
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:38,280
You need to add some text for me to talk.

4932
03:25:38,380 --> 03:25:41,920
For as these members are formed for a particular purpose,

4933
03:25:42,260 --> 03:25:46,620
and by working according to their several constitutions, obtain what is their own.

4934
03:25:50,260 --> 03:25:55,420
Wilt thou then, my soul, never be good and simple, and one and naked,

4935
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:58,440
more manifest than the body which surrounds thee?

4936
03:25:59,320 --> 03:26:02,680
Wilt thou never enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition?

4937
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:07,920
Wilt thou never be full, and without a want of any kind,

4938
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:12,980
longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything, either animate or inanimate,

4939
03:26:13,180 --> 03:26:17,020
for the enjoyment of? You need to add some text for me to talk.

4940
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:20,520
But wilt thou be satisfied with thy present condition,

4941
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:23,040
and pleased with all that is about thee?

4942
03:26:24,170 --> 03:26:29,690
And wilt thou convince thyself that thou hast everything, and that it comes from the gods?

4943
03:26:30,470 --> 03:26:35,410
That everything is well for thee, and will be well whatever shall please them,

4944
03:26:38,960 --> 03:26:41,260
good and just and beautiful?

4945
03:26:41,540 --> 03:26:46,240
Which generates and holds together all things, and contains and embraces all things,

4946
03:26:46,360 --> 03:26:49,220
which are dissolved for the production of other like things?

4947
03:26:49,880 --> 03:26:53,720
Nor yet desiring time, wherein thou shalt have longer enjoyment,

4948
03:26:54,140 --> 03:26:59,720
or place, or pleasant climate, or society of men with whom thou mayest live in harmony.

4949
03:27:00,620 --> 03:27:04,900
Wilt thou never be such that thou shalt so dwell in community with gods and men,

4950
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:08,540
as neither to find fault with them at all, nor to be condemned by them?

4951
03:27:09,180 --> 03:27:14,420
Observe what thy nature requires, so far as thou art governed by nature only.

4952
03:27:18,850 --> 03:27:22,770
And all this thou mayest allow thyself, if thy nature,

4953
03:27:23,090 --> 03:27:27,390
so far as thou art a rational animal, shall not be made worse by it.

4954
03:27:27,970 --> 03:27:33,410
And but the rational animal is consequently also a political, social animal.

4955
03:27:34,680 --> 03:27:38,240
Use these rules then, and trouble thyself about nothing else.

4956
03:27:38,240 --> 03:27:44,420
Everything which happens, either happens in such wise as thou art formed by nature to bear it,

4957
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:48,120
or as thou art not formed by nature to bear it.

4958
03:27:50,670 --> 03:27:55,550
But if it happens in such wise as thou art not formed by nature to bear it,

4959
03:27:55,730 --> 03:27:59,330
do not complain, for it will perish after it has consumed thee.

4960
03:27:59,750 --> 03:28:04,330
Remember, however, that thou art formed by nature to bear everything,

4961
03:28:04,950 --> 03:28:10,070
with respect to which it depends on thy own opinion to make it endurable and tolerable.

4962
03:28:10,350 --> 03:28:15,970
By thinking that it is either thy interest or thy think, if a man is mistaken,

4963
03:28:16,550 --> 03:28:19,250
instruct him kindly, and show him his error.

4964
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:24,460
But if thou art not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.

4965
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:28,440
Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity,

4966
03:28:28,900 --> 03:28:32,880
and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of thy being,

4967
03:28:33,080 --> 03:28:35,000
and of that which is incident to it.

4968
03:28:35,380 --> 03:28:39,780
Whether the universe is a concourse of atoms, or nature is a system,

4969
03:28:40,380 --> 03:28:46,200
let this first be established, that I am a part of the whole which is governed by nature.

4970
03:28:50,670 --> 03:28:56,770
For remembering this, inasmuch as I am a part, I shall be discontented with none of the things

4971
03:28:56,770 --> 03:29:02,960
which are assigned to me out of the whole, for nothing is injurious to the part,

4972
03:29:03,950 --> 03:29:09,430
if it is for the advantage of the whole, for the whole contains nothing which is not

4973
03:29:09,430 --> 03:29:13,850
for its advantage, and all natures indeed have this common principle,

4974
03:29:14,530 --> 03:29:17,070
but the nature of the universe has this principle.

4975
03:29:18,300 --> 03:29:26,090
Besides, that it cannot be incompelled even by any external cause to generate anything harmful

4976
03:29:26,090 --> 03:29:31,850
to itself. By remembering then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be content with

4977
03:29:31,850 --> 03:29:37,110
everything that happens, and inasmuch as I am in a manner intimately related to the parts

4978
03:29:37,110 --> 03:29:44,860
which are of the same kind with myself, I shall do nothing unsocial, but I shall rather direct

4979
03:29:44,860 --> 03:29:53,370
myself to the things which are of the same kind with myself, and I shall turn all my efforts

4980
03:29:53,370 --> 03:29:59,990
to the common interest, and divert them from the contrary. Now, if these things are done so,

4981
03:30:00,190 --> 03:30:06,370
life must flow on happily, just as thou mayst observe that the life of a citizen is happy,

4982
03:30:06,370 --> 03:30:11,310
who continues a course of action which is advantageous to his fellow citizens,

4983
03:30:11,570 --> 03:30:14,810
and is content with whatever the state may assign to him.

4984
03:30:15,070 --> 03:30:20,430
The parts of the whole everything, I mean, which is naturally comprehended in the universe,

4985
03:30:20,830 --> 03:30:30,140
must of necessity perish. But let this be understood in this sense, that they must

4986
03:30:30,140 --> 03:30:36,340
undergo change, but if this is naturally both an evil and a necessity for the parts,

4987
03:30:36,340 --> 03:30:42,480
the whole would not continue to exist in a good condition, the parts being subject to change and

4988
03:30:42,480 --> 03:30:50,720
constituted so as to perish in various ways. For whether did Nature herself design to do evil

4989
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:56,520
to the things which are parts of herself, and to make them subject to evil and of necessity

4990
03:30:56,520 --> 03:31:02,860
fall into evil, or have such results happened without her knowing it? You need to add some

4991
03:31:02,860 --> 03:31:09,030
text for me to talk. But if a man should even drop the term Nature as an efficient power,

4992
03:31:09,490 --> 03:31:16,260
and should speak of these things as natural, even then it would be ridiculous to affirm at

4993
03:31:16,260 --> 03:31:21,040
the same time that the parts of the whole are in their nature subject to change,

4994
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:25,640
and at the same time to be surprised or vexed as if something were happening

4995
03:31:25,640 --> 03:31:31,600
contrary to Nature, particularly as the dissolution of things is in to those things

4996
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:38,160
of which each thing is composed, both these suppositions indeed are incredible. For there

4997
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:42,220
is either a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded,

4998
03:31:42,440 --> 03:31:46,620
or a change from the solid to and the earthy and from the airy to the aerial,

4999
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:52,320
so that these parts are taken back into the universal reason, whether this at certain periods

5000
03:31:52,320 --> 03:31:58,400
is consumed by fire or renewed by. And do not imagine that the solid and the airy part

5001
03:31:58,400 --> 03:32:07,040
belong to thee from the time of generation. This, then, which has received the accretion,

5002
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:12,460
changes, not that which thy mother brought forth. But suppose that this which thy mother

5003
03:32:12,460 --> 03:32:17,760
brought forth implicates thee very much with that other part, which has the peculiar quality

5004
03:32:17,760 --> 03:32:23,820
of change. This is nothing, in fact, in the way of objection to what is said. When thou hast

5005
03:32:23,820 --> 03:32:31,340
assumed these names, good, modest, true, rational, a man of equanimity and magnanimous,

5006
03:32:31,820 --> 03:32:36,880
take care that thou dost not change these names, and if thou shouldst lose them.

5007
03:32:39,700 --> 03:32:44,700
And remember that the term rational was intended to signify a discriminating attention

5008
03:32:44,700 --> 03:32:49,540
to every several thing, and freedom from negligence of the things which are assigned

5009
03:32:49,540 --> 03:32:55,160
to thee by the common nature, and that magnanimity is the elevation of the intelligent

5010
03:32:55,160 --> 03:33:01,480
part above the pleasurable or painful sensations of the flesh, and above that poor thing called

5011
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:09,070
fame, and death, and all such things. For to continue to be such as thou hast his or two

5012
03:33:09,070 --> 03:33:15,830
been, and to be Tom in pieces and defiled in such a life, is the character of a very stupid

5013
03:33:15,830 --> 03:33:23,500
man, and one over fond of his life. And like those half devoured fighters with wild beasts,

5014
03:33:23,500 --> 03:33:28,860
who though covered with wounds and gore, still entreat to be kept to the following day,

5015
03:33:29,140 --> 03:33:34,500
though they will be exposed. If then thou maintainest thyself in the possession of

5016
03:33:34,500 --> 03:33:39,580
these names, without desiring to be called by these names by others, thou wilt be another

5017
03:33:39,580 --> 03:33:45,600
person and wilt enter on another life. Therefore, fix thyself in the possession of

5018
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:51,960
these few names, and if thou art able to abide in them, abide as if thou wast removed

5019
03:33:51,960 --> 03:33:58,580
to certain islands of the happy out of them, and dost not maintain thy hold, go courageously

5020
03:33:58,580 --> 03:34:04,340
into some nook where thou shalt maintain them, or even depart at once from life,

5021
03:34:04,680 --> 03:34:11,300
not in passion, but with simplicity and freedom and modesty, after doing this one

5022
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:15,920
laudable thing, at least in thy life, to have gone out of it thus.

5023
03:34:16,760 --> 03:34:23,660
You need to add some text for me to talk. In order, however, to the remembrance of these names,

5024
03:34:24,080 --> 03:34:30,170
it will greatly help thee, if thou rememberest the gods, and that they wish not to be

5025
03:34:30,170 --> 03:34:44,640
flattered, but wish all reasonable beings to be made like themselves. Does the work of a

5026
03:34:44,640 --> 03:34:51,960
bee is a bee, and that, what does the work of a man, is a man? Mime, war, astonishment,

5027
03:34:51,960 --> 03:35:03,140
torpor, slavery, will daily wipe out those holy principles of thine, but it is thy duty,

5028
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:08,440
so to look on and so to do everything, that at the same time the power of dealing with

5029
03:35:08,440 --> 03:35:15,440
circumstances is perfected, and the contemplative faculty is exercised, and the confidence which

5030
03:35:15,440 --> 03:35:20,020
comes from the knowledge of each several thing is maintained without showing it,

5031
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:25,060
but yet not concealed. You need to add some text for me to talk.

5032
03:35:25,840 --> 03:35:31,480
For when wilt thou enjoy simplicity, when gravity, and when the knowledge of every

5033
03:35:31,480 --> 03:35:38,730
several thing, both what it is in substance, and what place it has in the universe,

5034
03:35:39,640 --> 03:35:44,280
and how long it is formed to exist, and of what things it is compounded,

5035
03:35:44,940 --> 03:35:50,780
and to whom it can belong, and who are able both to give it, and take it away.

5036
03:35:51,440 --> 03:35:56,100
A spider is proud when it has caught a fly, and another when he has caught a poor hair,

5037
03:35:56,860 --> 03:36:02,070
and another when he has taken a little fish in a net, and another when he has taken wild

5038
03:36:02,070 --> 03:36:12,970
boars, and another when he has taken bears. Are not these robbers, if thou examinest

5039
03:36:12,970 --> 03:36:20,150
their opinions? Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into one another,

5040
03:36:20,410 --> 03:36:25,850
and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about this part of philosophy,

5041
03:36:31,440 --> 03:36:37,640
for nothing is so much adapted to produce magnanimity. Such a man has put off the

5042
03:36:37,640 --> 03:36:43,740
body, and as he sees that he must, no one knows how soon go away from among men,

5043
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:50,430
and leave everything here. He gives himself up entirely to just doing in all his actions,

5044
03:36:50,790 --> 03:36:55,150
and in everything else that happens he resigns himself to the universal nature.

5045
03:36:59,190 --> 03:37:02,790
But as to what any man shall say, or think about him, or do against him,

5046
03:37:03,030 --> 03:37:08,270
he never even thinks of it being himself contented with these two things, with acting

5047
03:37:08,270 --> 03:37:12,950
justly in what he now does, and being satisfied with what is now assigned to him,

5048
03:37:12,950 --> 03:37:18,910
and he lays aside all distracting and busy pursuits, and desires nothing else than to

5049
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:24,270
accomplish the straight course through the law, and by accomplishing the straight course to

5050
03:37:24,270 --> 03:37:33,390
follow God. What need is there of suspicious fear, since it is in thy power to inquire

5051
03:37:33,390 --> 03:37:41,720
what ought to be done? And if thou seest clear, go by this way content, without turning back.

5052
03:37:43,350 --> 03:37:51,090
But if any other things oppose thee, go on according to thy powers with due consideration,

5053
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:56,750
keeping to that which appears to be just. For it is best to reach this object,

5054
03:37:56,950 --> 03:38:00,870
and if thou dost fail, let thy failure be in attempting this.

5055
03:38:01,350 --> 03:38:07,170
He who follows reason in all things, is both tranquil and active at the same time.

5056
03:38:12,930 --> 03:38:19,110
Now hast not forgotten, I suppose, that those who assume arrogant heirs in bestowing their praise

5057
03:38:19,110 --> 03:38:25,430
or blame on others, are such as they are at bed, and at board, and now hast not forgotten

5058
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:31,490
what they do, and what they avoid, and what they pursue, and how they steal, and how they

5059
03:38:31,490 --> 03:38:39,680
rob, not with hands and feet, but with their most valuable part, means of which there is

5060
03:38:39,680 --> 03:38:48,500
When a man chooses, fidelity, modesty, truth, law, a good demon, happiness, it will make no

5061
03:38:48,500 --> 03:38:55,020
difference. To her who gives and takes back all, to nature, the man who is instructed and

5062
03:38:55,020 --> 03:39:03,570
modest says, Give what thou wilt, take back what thou wilt. Short is the little which remains

5063
03:39:03,570 --> 03:39:10,630
to thee of life. Live as on a mountain. For it makes no difference whether a man lives there

5064
03:39:10,630 --> 03:39:16,780
or here, if he lives everywhere in the world, as in a state, political community.

5065
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:22,120
Let men see. Let them know a real man, who lives according to nature.

5066
03:39:25,980 --> 03:39:29,240
Constantly contemplate the whole of time and the whole of substance,

5067
03:39:29,660 --> 03:39:34,160
and consider that all individual things as to substance are a grain of a fig,

5068
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:40,600
and as to time the turning of a gimlet. Look at everything that exists, and observe that it

5069
03:39:40,600 --> 03:39:45,940
is already in dissolution and in change, and as it were putrefaction or dispersion,

5070
03:39:46,120 --> 03:39:51,600
or that everything is so. Consider what men are when they are eating, sleeping,

5071
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:57,330
generating, easing themselves, and so forth. Then what kind of men they are when they are

5072
03:39:57,330 --> 03:40:02,830
imperious and arrogant, or angry and scolding from their elevated place, but a short time

5073
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:08,610
ago, to how many they were slaves, and for what things, and after a little time consider

5074
03:40:08,610 --> 03:40:17,950
what a condition they will be. And it is for its good, at the time when nature brings it.

5075
03:40:21,730 --> 03:40:26,670
And is not this too said, that this or that loves, is want to be produced?

5076
03:40:31,530 --> 03:40:35,250
Either thou livest here, and hast already accustomed thyself to it,

5077
03:40:35,570 --> 03:40:40,790
or thou art going away, and this was thy own will, or thou art dying, and hast

5078
03:40:40,790 --> 03:40:47,350
discharged thy duty. But besides these things, there is nothing. Be of good cheer then.

5079
03:40:47,350 --> 03:40:52,830
Let this always be plain to thee, that this piece of land is like any other,

5080
03:40:53,110 --> 03:40:57,710
and that all things here are the same, with things on top of a mountain,

5081
03:40:57,870 --> 03:41:04,730
or on the seashore, or wherever thou choosest to be. For thou wilt find just what Plato says,

5082
03:41:05,210 --> 03:41:09,470
dwelling within the walls of a city, as in a shepherd's fold on a mountain.

5083
03:41:14,140 --> 03:41:19,440
What is my ruling faculty now to me, and of what nature am I now making it?

5084
03:41:21,880 --> 03:41:28,020
Is it void of understanding? Is it loosed and rent asunder from social life?

5085
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:34,830
Is it melted into and mixed with the poor flesh so as to move together with it?

5086
03:41:35,710 --> 03:41:43,410
He who flies from his master is a runaway, but the law is master,

5087
03:41:43,790 --> 03:41:50,610
and he who breaks the law is a runaway. And he also who is grieved or angry or afraid

5088
03:41:50,610 --> 03:41:57,650
is dissatisfied because something has been or nis or shall be of the things which are appointed

5089
03:41:57,650 --> 03:42:04,910
by him who rules all things, and he is law, and assigns to every man what is fit. He then who

5090
03:42:04,910 --> 03:42:13,260
fears or is grieved or is angry is a runaway. A man deposits seed in a womb and goes away,

5091
03:42:13,500 --> 03:42:20,840
and then another cause takes it and labors on it and makes a child. Again the child passes

5092
03:42:20,840 --> 03:42:25,920
food down through the throat, and then another cause takes it and makes perception and motion,

5093
03:42:26,320 --> 03:42:32,900
and in fine life and strength and other things, how many and how strange. Observe then the things

5094
03:42:32,900 --> 03:42:37,700
which are produced in such a hidden way, and see the power just as we see the power which

5095
03:42:37,700 --> 03:42:43,820
carries things downwards and upwards, not. Constantly consider how all things such as they

5096
03:42:43,820 --> 03:42:48,480
now are, in time past also were, and consider that they will be the same again.

5097
03:42:48,480 --> 03:42:55,400
And place before thy eyes entire dramas and stages of the same form whatever thou hast learned

5098
03:42:55,400 --> 03:43:00,700
from thy experience or from older history, for example, the whole court of Hadrian,

5099
03:43:01,080 --> 03:43:07,350
and the whole court of Antoninus, and the whole court of Philip, Alexander,

5100
03:43:07,630 --> 03:43:12,910
Croesus, for all those were such dramas as we see now only with different actors.

5101
03:43:12,910 --> 03:43:19,850
Imagine every man who is grieved at anything or discontented to be like a pig which is

5102
03:43:19,850 --> 03:43:29,490
sacrificed and kicks and screams. Like this pig also is he who on his bed in silence laments

5103
03:43:29,490 --> 03:43:36,270
the bonds in which we are held, and consider that only to the rational animal is it given to.

5104
03:43:36,750 --> 03:43:43,230
Follow voluntarily what happens, but simply to follow is a necessity imposed on all.

5105
03:43:45,640 --> 03:43:50,960
Severally, on the occasion of every thing that thou doest, pause and ask thyself,

5106
03:43:51,500 --> 03:43:55,380
if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives thee of this.

5107
03:43:59,590 --> 03:44:05,290
When thou art offended at any man's fault, forthwith turn to thyself, and reflect in

5108
03:44:05,290 --> 03:44:14,260
what like manner thou dost err. Thyself, for example, in thinking that money is a good thing,

5109
03:44:14,260 --> 03:44:20,180
or pleasure, or a bit of reputation, and the like. For by attending to this,

5110
03:44:20,440 --> 03:44:25,500
thou wilt quickly forget thy anger. If this consideration also is added, that the man is

5111
03:44:25,500 --> 03:44:31,580
compelled, for what else could he do? Or, if thou art able, take away from him the compulsion.

5112
03:44:32,180 --> 03:44:37,480
You need to add some text for me to talk. When thou hast seen Satyron the Socratic,

5113
03:44:37,840 --> 03:44:42,900
think of either Eudicius or Hymen, and when thou hast seen Euphrates, think of Eutychian

5114
03:44:42,900 --> 03:44:48,960
or Silvanus, and when thou hast seen Alcefron, think of Tropeiophorus, and when thou hast seen

5115
03:44:48,960 --> 03:44:53,320
Xenophon, think of Credo or Severus, and when thou hast looked on thyself,

5116
03:44:53,580 --> 03:44:58,620
think of any other Caesar, and in the case of, then let this thought be in thy mind,

5117
03:44:58,840 --> 03:45:04,480
where then are those men? Nowhere, or nobody knows where. For thus continuously,

5118
03:45:04,880 --> 03:45:10,800
thou wilt look at human things as smoke, and nothing at all, especially if thou reflectest

5119
03:45:10,800 --> 03:45:17,980
at the same time, that what has once changed will never exist again, in the infinite duration of

5120
03:45:17,980 --> 03:45:27,590
time. But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy existence, and why art thou not content

5121
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:34,640
to pass through this short time in an orderly way? What matter and opportunity for thy activity

5122
03:45:34,640 --> 03:45:40,920
art thou avoiding? For what else are all these things, except exercises for the reason,

5123
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:46,540
when it has viewed carefully, and by examination into their nature, the things which happen in

5124
03:45:46,540 --> 03:45:52,900
life? Persevere then, until thou shalt have made these things thy own, as the stomach which

5125
03:45:52,900 --> 03:45:58,100
is strengthened makes all things its own, as the blazing fire makes flame and brightness out

5126
03:45:58,100 --> 03:46:03,320
of. Let it not be in any man's power to say truly of thee, that thou art not simple,

5127
03:46:03,520 --> 03:46:12,060
or that thou art not good. But let him be a liar, for who is he that shall hinder thee

5128
03:46:12,060 --> 03:46:16,880
from being good and simple? Do thou only determine to live no longer, unless thou

5129
03:46:16,880 --> 03:46:21,700
shalt be such? For neither does reason allow thee to live, if thou art not such.

5130
03:46:22,340 --> 03:46:28,160
What is that which, as to this material, our life, can be done or said in the way most

5131
03:46:28,160 --> 03:46:33,740
conformable to reason? You need to add some text for me to talk. Thou wilt not cease

5132
03:46:33,740 --> 03:46:39,020
to lament till thy mind is in such a condition that, what luxury is to those who enjoy

5133
03:46:39,020 --> 03:46:45,220
pleasure, such shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented to thee.

5134
03:46:50,830 --> 03:46:54,630
For whatever this may be, it is in thy power to do it or to say it,

5135
03:46:54,770 --> 03:46:59,610
and do not make excuses that thou art hindered. And it is in his power everywhere.

5136
03:47:00,520 --> 03:47:04,660
Now it is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere by its own motion,

5137
03:47:05,060 --> 03:47:09,520
nor yet to water, nor to fire, nor to anything else which is governed by nature,

5138
03:47:09,520 --> 03:47:15,260
or an irrational soul, for the things which, but intelligence and reason, are able to go

5139
03:47:15,260 --> 03:47:19,940
through everything that opposes them, and in such manner as they are formed by nature,

5140
03:47:20,180 --> 03:47:26,540
and as they choose. Place before thy eyes this facility with which the reason will be carried

5141
03:47:26,540 --> 03:47:36,900
through all things, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder down an inclined

5142
03:47:36,900 --> 03:47:44,360
surface. And seek for nothing, for all other obstacles either affect the body only which is

5143
03:47:44,360 --> 03:47:49,380
a dead thing, or, except through opinion and the yielding of the reason itself,

5144
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:56,500
they do not crush nor do any harm of any kind, for if they did, he who felt it would

5145
03:47:56,500 --> 03:48:02,440
immediately become bad. Now, in the case of all things which have a certain constitution,

5146
03:48:02,440 --> 03:48:08,600
whatever harm may happen to any of them, that which is so affected becomes consequently worse.

5147
03:48:09,140 --> 03:48:15,780
But in the like case a man becomes both better, if one may say so, and more worthy of praise and

5148
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:21,340
be making a right use of these accidents. And finally remember that nothing harms him who

5149
03:48:21,340 --> 03:48:28,000
is really a citizen, which does not harm the state, nor yet does anything harm the state,

5150
03:48:28,640 --> 03:48:35,360
which does not harm law, order, and of these things which are called misfortunes,

5151
03:48:35,820 --> 03:48:47,500
not one harms law, what then does not harm, for example, leaves, some the wind scatters on

5152
03:48:47,500 --> 03:48:55,100
the ground, so is the race of men, leaves also are thy children, and leaves too are they who

5153
03:48:55,100 --> 03:49:01,500
cry out as if they were worthy of credit and bestow their praise, or on the contrary curse,

5154
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:11,250
or secretly blame and sneer, for all such things as these are produced in the season of spring,

5155
03:49:11,570 --> 03:49:17,750
as the poet says, then the wind casts them down, then the forest produces other leaves

5156
03:49:17,750 --> 03:49:29,560
in their places. A little time and thou shalt close thy eyes, and him who has attended thee

5157
03:49:29,560 --> 03:49:38,700
to thy grave another soon will lament, and the healthy hearing and smelling ought to be

5158
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:47,020
ready to perceive all that can be heard and smelled, and accordingly the healthy

5159
03:49:47,020 --> 03:49:59,010
understanding ought to be prepared for everything which happens. There is no man so fortunate that

5160
03:49:59,010 --> 03:50:04,490
there shall not be by him when he is dying, some who are pleased with what is going to happen.

5161
03:50:09,080 --> 03:50:14,840
Pose that he was a good and wise man. Will there not be at last someone to say to himself,

5162
03:50:14,840 --> 03:50:23,790
Let us at last breathe freely, being relieved from this schoolmaster. It is true that he was

5163
03:50:23,790 --> 03:50:35,900
harsh to none of us, but I perceived that he tacitly condemns us. Thou wilt consider this

5164
03:50:35,900 --> 03:50:41,300
then, when thou art dying, and thou wilt depart more contentedly by reflecting thus.

5165
03:50:41,880 --> 03:50:46,540
I am going away from such a life, in which even my associates in behalf of whom I have

5166
03:50:46,540 --> 03:51:05,120
so much, prayed and cared. Do not, however, for this reason go away less kindly disposed to them,

5167
03:51:05,580 --> 03:51:11,760
but preserving thy own character, and friendly and benevolent and mild, and on the other hand,

5168
03:51:12,080 --> 03:51:18,760
not as if thou wast torn away, but as when a man dies. A quiet death, the poor soul is

5169
03:51:18,760 --> 03:51:26,480
easily separated from the body. Such also ought thy departure from men to be. Why then

5170
03:51:26,480 --> 03:51:31,380
should a man cling to a longer stay here? But does she now dissolve the union?

5171
03:51:32,490 --> 03:51:39,170
Well, I am separated as from kinsmen, not, however, drag resisting, but without compulsion.

5172
03:51:39,790 --> 03:51:45,410
For this, too, is one of the things according to nature. Accustom thyself as much as possible

5173
03:51:45,410 --> 03:51:50,870
on the occasion of anything being done by any person to inquire with thyself. For what object

5174
03:51:50,870 --> 03:52:03,180
is this man doing this? Remember that this which pulls the strings is the thing which

5175
03:52:03,180 --> 03:52:09,820
is hidden within. This is the power of end persuasion. This is life. This, if one may so

5176
03:52:09,820 --> 03:52:17,470
say, is man. In contemplating thyself, never include the vessel which surrounds thee,

5177
03:52:17,690 --> 03:52:21,970
and these instruments which are attached about it. For they are like to an axe,

5178
03:52:21,970 --> 03:52:34,250
differing only in this, that they grow to the body. Book 11. These are the properties

5179
03:52:34,250 --> 03:52:42,390
of the rational soul. It sees itself, analyses itself, and makes itself such as it chooses,

5180
03:52:42,930 --> 03:52:48,550
the fruit which it bears itself enjoys, for the fruits of plants, and that in animals

5181
03:52:48,550 --> 03:52:55,470
which corresponds to fruits others enjoy. It obtains its own end, wherever the limit of

5182
03:52:55,470 --> 03:53:02,080
it is fixed, not as in a dance, and in a play, and in such like things, where the whole action

5183
03:53:02,080 --> 03:53:08,960
is incomplete, if anything cuts it short. But in every part, and wherever it may be stopped,

5184
03:53:09,440 --> 03:53:15,440
it makes what has been set before it full and complete, so that it can say, I have what is

5185
03:53:15,440 --> 03:53:21,400
my own, you need to add some text for me to talk. And further, it traverses the whole

5186
03:53:21,400 --> 03:53:28,260
universe, and the surrounding vacuum, and surveys its form, and it extends itself into

5187
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:36,380
the infinity of time, and embraces and comprehends the periodical renovation of all things,

5188
03:53:36,980 --> 03:53:40,700
and it comprehends that those who come after us will see nothing new,

5189
03:53:41,510 --> 03:53:48,510
nor have those before us seen anything more. Who, his forty years old, if he has any

5190
03:53:48,510 --> 03:53:53,950
understanding at all, has seen by virtue of the uniformity that prevails all things which have

5191
03:53:53,950 --> 03:54:00,250
been, and all that will be, this too, is a property of the rational soul, love of one's

5192
03:54:00,250 --> 03:54:06,630
neighbor, and truth and modesty, and to value nothing more than itself, which is also the

5193
03:54:06,630 --> 03:54:13,690
property of law. Thus then, right reason differs not at all from the reason of justice.

5194
03:54:14,400 --> 03:54:19,860
Thou wilt set little value on pleasing song, and dancing, and the pancratium,

5195
03:54:20,280 --> 03:54:24,520
if thou wilt distribute the melody of the voice into its several sounds,

5196
03:54:24,860 --> 03:54:30,560
and ask thyself as to each, if thou art mastered by this, for thou wilt be

5197
03:54:30,560 --> 03:54:34,600
prevented by shame from confessing it, and in the matter of dancing,

5198
03:54:34,940 --> 03:54:42,060
if at each movement and attitude, thou wilt do thee. Same, and the like also,

5199
03:54:42,060 --> 03:54:48,800
in the matter of the pancratium. In all things then, except virtue, and the acts of virtue,

5200
03:54:49,140 --> 03:54:53,960
remember to apply thyself to their several parts, and by this division,

5201
03:54:54,380 --> 03:55:00,600
to come to value them little, and apply this rule, also, to thy whole life.

5202
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:07,620
You need to add some text for me to talk. What a soul that is, which is ready, if at any

5203
03:55:07,620 --> 03:55:13,360
moment it must be separated from the body, and ready either to be extinguished or dispersed,

5204
03:55:13,640 --> 03:55:18,700
or continue to exist, but so that this readiness comes from a man's own judgment,

5205
03:55:19,280 --> 03:55:24,600
not from mere obstinacy, as with the Christians, but considerately and with dignity,

5206
03:55:24,960 --> 03:55:30,920
and in a way to persuade another, without. And how is this accomplished well, except by

5207
03:55:30,920 --> 03:55:35,880
general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and others about the proper

5208
03:55:35,880 --> 03:55:41,840
constitution of man? At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding men

5209
03:55:41,840 --> 03:55:46,900
of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature for things to happen so,

5210
03:55:47,220 --> 03:55:52,700
and that, if you are delighted. With what is shown on the stage, you should not be

5211
03:55:52,700 --> 03:55:58,000
troubled with that which takes place on the larger stage. Have I done something for the

5212
03:55:58,000 --> 03:56:04,160
general interest? Well then, I have had my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind,

5213
03:56:04,160 --> 03:56:15,600
and never stop doing such good. What is thy art? And, indeed, some things are said well

5214
03:56:15,600 --> 03:56:22,300
by the dramatic writers, of which kind is the following, E. Tau and me and my children.

5215
03:56:23,410 --> 03:56:31,860
If the gods neglect, this has its reason too, and life's harvest,

5216
03:56:32,160 --> 03:56:37,060
reap like the wheat's fruitful ear, and other things of the same kind.

5217
03:56:37,060 --> 03:56:43,280
After tragedy the old comedy was introduced, which had a magisterial freedom of speech,

5218
03:56:43,820 --> 03:56:48,980
and by its very plainness of speaking was useful in reminding men to beware of

5219
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:56,630
insolence. And for this purpose too, diogenies used to take from these writers.

5220
03:56:57,070 --> 03:57:01,810
But as to the middle comedy which came next, observe what it was, and again,

5221
03:57:02,130 --> 03:57:07,230
for what object the new comedy was introduced, which gradually sunk down into a mere mimic

5222
03:57:07,230 --> 03:57:12,870
artifice. That some good things are said even by these writers everybody knows.

5223
03:57:13,710 --> 03:57:19,030
But the whole plan of such poetry and dramaturgy, to what end does it look?

5224
03:57:22,330 --> 03:57:27,590
That there is not another condition of life so well suited for philosophizing as this

5225
03:57:27,590 --> 03:57:32,570
in which thou now happenest to be. A branch cut off from the adjacent branch

5226
03:57:32,570 --> 03:57:37,190
must of necessity be cut off from the whole tree also. So too a man,

5227
03:57:37,190 --> 03:57:40,910
when he is separated from another man, has fallen off from the whole social community.

5228
03:57:41,690 --> 03:57:46,950
Now as to a branch, another cuts it off, but a man by his own act separates himself

5229
03:57:46,950 --> 03:57:52,470
from his neighbor when he hates him, and turns away from him, and he does not know

5230
03:57:52,470 --> 03:57:58,470
that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social system. Yet he has his

5231
03:57:58,470 --> 03:58:03,410
privilege certainly from Zeus, who frames society. For it is in our power to grow again

5232
03:58:03,410 --> 03:58:08,090
to that which is near to us, and be to come, a part which helps to make up the whole.

5233
03:58:08,790 --> 03:58:14,670
However, if it often happens, this kind nough separation, it makes it difficult for that

5234
03:58:14,670 --> 03:58:20,190
which detaches itself to be brought to unity, and to be restored to its. You need to add

5235
03:58:20,190 --> 03:58:25,090
some text for me to talk. Finally the branch, which from the first grew together

5236
03:58:25,090 --> 03:58:31,310
with the tree, and has continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after

5237
03:58:31,310 --> 03:58:36,810
being cut off, is then ingrafted. For this is something like what the gardeners mean

5238
03:58:36,810 --> 03:58:42,430
when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that it has not the same mind

5239
03:58:42,430 --> 03:58:48,490
with it. You need to add some text for me to talk. As those who try to stand in thy way when

5240
03:58:48,490 --> 03:58:53,430
thou are proceeding according to right reason, will not be able to turn thee aside from thy

5241
03:58:53,430 --> 03:58:58,390
proper action, so neither let them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings towards them,

5242
03:58:58,390 --> 03:59:04,800
but be on thy guard equally in both matters, not only in the matter of steady judgment and action,

5243
03:59:07,540 --> 03:59:13,320
gentleness towards those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble thee. For this also is a

5244
03:59:13,320 --> 03:59:18,380
weakness, to be vexed at them, as well as to be diverted from thy course of action,

5245
03:59:18,620 --> 03:59:24,620
and to give way through fear, for both are equally deserters from their post, the man

5246
03:59:24,620 --> 03:59:30,780
who does it through fear, and the man who is alienated from him who is by nature a kinsman

5247
03:59:30,780 --> 03:59:37,360
and a friend. There is no nature which is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the nature

5248
03:59:37,360 --> 03:59:48,640
of things. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior, therefore the

5249
03:59:48,640 --> 03:59:59,550
universal nature does so too, and indeed hence. If the things do not come to thee,

5250
03:59:59,550 --> 04:00:05,210
the pursuits and avoidances of which disturb thee, still in a manner thou goest to them,

5251
04:00:06,190 --> 04:00:10,630
let then thy judgment about them be at rest, and they will remain quiet,

5252
04:00:10,970 --> 04:00:16,530
and thou wilt not be seen either pursuing or avoiding. The spherical form of the soul

5253
04:00:16,530 --> 04:00:22,150
maintains its figure, when it is neither extended towards any object, nor contracted

5254
04:00:22,150 --> 04:00:28,990
inwards, nor dispersed, nor sinks down, but is illuminated by light, by which it sees the

5255
04:00:28,990 --> 04:00:35,750
truth, the truth of all things, and the truth that is in itself. Suppose any man shall

5256
04:00:35,750 --> 04:00:44,540
despise me, let him look to that himself, but I will look to this, that I be not

5257
04:00:44,540 --> 04:00:55,060
discovered doing or saying anything deserving of contempt, shall any man hate me, but I

5258
04:00:55,060 --> 04:01:00,740
will be mild and benevolent towards every man, and ready to show even him his mistake,

5259
04:01:01,560 --> 04:01:07,740
not reproachfully, nor yet is making a display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly,

5260
04:01:08,220 --> 04:01:13,920
like the great Phocion, unless indeed he only assumed it. For the interior parts

5261
04:01:13,920 --> 04:01:18,420
ought to be such, and a man ought to be seen by the gods neither dissatisfied with anything

5262
04:01:18,420 --> 04:01:25,200
nor complaining. For what evil is it to thee, if thou art now doing what is agreeable to thy

5263
04:01:25,200 --> 04:01:31,000
nature, and art satisfied with that which at this moment is suitable to the nature of the

5264
04:01:31,000 --> 04:01:38,700
universe, since thou art a human being placed? At thy post, in order that what is for the

5265
04:01:38,700 --> 04:01:45,440
common advantage may be done in some way, men despise one another, and flatter one another,

5266
04:01:46,020 --> 04:01:52,120
and men wish to raise themselves above one another, and crouch before one another.

5267
04:02:02,100 --> 04:02:08,440
What art thou doing, man? There is no occasion to give this notice. It will soon show itself

5268
04:02:08,440 --> 04:02:18,660
by acts. Such as a man's character is, he immediately shows it in his eyes, just as he

5269
04:02:18,660 --> 04:02:24,280
who is beloved forthwith reads everything in the eyes of lovers. The man who is honest and

5270
04:02:24,280 --> 04:02:30,160
good ought to be exactly like a man who smells strong, so that the bystander as soon

5271
04:02:30,160 --> 04:02:41,970
as he comes near him must smell whether he chews or not. Nothing is more disgraceful than

5272
04:02:41,970 --> 04:03:00,100
a wolfish friendship, false friendship. Avoid this most of all. See? Bossed! As to living

5273
04:03:00,100 --> 04:03:06,540
in the best way, this power is in the soul, if it be indifferent to things which are

5274
04:03:06,540 --> 04:03:12,350
indifferent. You need to add some text for me to talk, and it will be indifferent.

5275
04:03:14,370 --> 04:03:21,660
If it looks on each of these things separately and altogether, and if it remembers that not

5276
04:03:21,660 --> 04:03:28,140
one of them produces in us an opinion about itself, nor comes to us, but these things

5277
04:03:28,140 --> 04:03:45,640
remain immovable, power not to write them, and it being in our power, if perchance

5278
04:03:45,640 --> 04:03:51,480
these judgments have imperceptibly got admission to our minds, to wipe them out,

5279
04:03:51,480 --> 04:03:56,860
and if we remember also that such attention will only be for a short time,

5280
04:03:57,180 --> 04:04:04,220
and then life will be at an end. Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?

5281
04:04:04,940 --> 04:04:10,040
For if these things are according to nature, rejoice in them, and they will be easy to

5282
04:04:10,040 --> 04:04:16,440
thee. But if contrary to nature, seek what is conformable to thy own nature,

5283
04:04:17,330 --> 04:04:23,020
and strive towards this even if it bring no reputation, for every man is allowed to

5284
04:04:23,020 --> 04:04:27,880
seek his own good, consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists,

5285
04:04:28,300 --> 04:04:32,320
and into what it changes, and what kind of a thing it will be when it is changed,

5286
04:04:33,330 --> 04:04:39,030
and that it will sustain no harm. Any have offended against thee. Consider first,

5287
04:04:39,470 --> 04:04:43,190
what is my relation to men, and that we are made for one another,

5288
04:04:43,190 --> 04:04:49,410
and in another respect I was made to be set over them as a ram over the flock,

5289
04:04:49,750 --> 04:04:55,090
or a bull over the herd. But examine the matter from first principles. From this,

5290
04:04:55,590 --> 04:05:01,590
if all things are not mere atoms, it is nature which orders all things. If this is so,

5291
04:05:01,970 --> 04:05:07,510
the inferior things exist for the sake of the superior, and these for the sake of one

5292
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:14,050
another. Second, consider what kind of men they are at table, in bed, and so forth,

5293
04:05:14,350 --> 04:05:20,670
and particularly, under what compulsions in respect of opinions they are, are and as to

5294
04:05:20,670 --> 04:05:27,490
their acts. Consider with what pride they do what they do. Third, that if men do rightly

5295
04:05:27,490 --> 04:05:32,550
what they do, we ought not to be displeased, but if they do not right, it is plain that

5296
04:05:32,550 --> 04:05:38,390
they do so involuntarily and in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly deprived

5297
04:05:38,390 --> 04:05:44,090
of the truth, so also is it unwillingly deprived of the power of behaving to each man

5298
04:05:44,090 --> 04:05:49,270
according to his deserts. Accordingly, men are pained when they are called unjust,

5299
04:05:49,810 --> 04:05:55,730
ungrateful, and greedy, and in a word, wrongdoers to their neighbours. Fourth,

5300
04:05:56,290 --> 04:06:01,690
consider that thou also doest many things wrong, and that thou art a man like others,

5301
04:06:01,690 --> 04:06:07,510
and even if thou dost abstain from certain faults, still thou hast the disposition to

5302
04:06:07,510 --> 04:06:14,270
commit them, though either through cowardice or concern about reputation or some such mean

5303
04:06:14,270 --> 04:06:21,170
motive thou dost abstain from such faults. Fifth, consider that thou dost not even

5304
04:06:21,170 --> 04:06:26,250
understand whether men are doing wrong or not, for many things are done with a certain

5305
04:06:26,250 --> 04:06:35,140
reference to circumstances. And sixth, consider when thou art much vexed or grieved,

5306
04:06:35,440 --> 04:06:41,300
that man's life is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out dead.

5307
04:06:43,450 --> 04:06:50,160
Seventh, that it is not men's acts which disturb us, for those acts have their

5308
04:06:50,160 --> 04:06:54,880
foundation in men's ruling principles, but it is our own opinions which disturb us.

5309
04:06:55,380 --> 04:06:59,940
Take away these opinions, then, and resolve to dismiss thy judgment about an act as if

5310
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:10,710
it were something grievous, and thy anger is gone, by reflecting that no wrongful act

5311
04:07:10,710 --> 04:07:15,230
of another brings shame on thee, for unless that which is shameful is alone bad, thou

5312
04:07:15,230 --> 04:07:20,630
also must of necessity do many things wrong. Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought

5313
04:07:20,630 --> 04:07:25,430
on us by the anger and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves,

5314
04:07:26,030 --> 04:07:36,450
at which we are angry and vexed. For what will the most violent man do to thee,

5315
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:43,230
if thou continuest to be of a kind disposition towards him? And if, as opportunity offers,

5316
04:07:43,670 --> 04:07:48,770
thou gently admonishest him, and calmly correctest his errors at the very time

5317
04:07:48,770 --> 04:07:55,130
when he is trying to do thee harm, saying, Not so, my child. We are constituted by nature

5318
04:07:55,130 --> 04:08:03,160
for something else. Be injured, but thou art injuring thyself, my child, and show him

5319
04:08:03,160 --> 04:08:09,220
with gentle tact, and by general principles, that this is so, and that even bees do not do

5320
04:08:09,220 --> 04:08:15,040
as he does, nor any animals which are formed by nature to be gregarious. And thou must do

5321
04:08:15,040 --> 04:08:19,640
this neither with any double meaning nor in the way of reproach, but affectionately and

5322
04:08:19,640 --> 04:08:25,780
without any rancour in thy soul, and not as if thou wert lecturing. Him, nor yet that

5323
04:08:25,780 --> 04:08:30,500
any bystander may admire, but either when he is alone, and if others are in present.

5324
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:37,080
Remember these nine rules, as if thou hadst received them as a gift from the muses,

5325
04:08:37,260 --> 04:08:44,260
and begin at last to be a man while thou livest. But thou must equally avoid flattering men and

5326
04:08:44,260 --> 04:08:50,740
being vexed at them, for both are unsocial and lead to harm. You need to add some text for me

5327
04:08:50,740 --> 04:08:56,640
to talk. And let this truth be present to thee in the excitement of anger, that to be

5328
04:08:56,640 --> 04:09:03,400
moved by passion is not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they are more agreeable to

5329
04:09:03,400 --> 04:09:10,900
human nature, so also are they more manly. And he who possesses these qualities possesses

5330
04:09:10,900 --> 04:09:18,910
strength, nerves, and courage. For in the same degree in which a man's mind is nearer

5331
04:09:18,910 --> 04:09:24,690
to freedom from all passion, in the same degree also is it nearer to strength. And

5332
04:09:24,690 --> 04:09:31,530
a sense of pain is a characteristic of weakness, so also is anger. For he who yields to pain,

5333
04:09:31,690 --> 04:09:39,030
and he who yields to anger, both are wounded, and both submit. But if thou wilt, receive also

5334
04:09:39,030 --> 04:09:45,010
a tenth present from the leader of the muses, Apollo. And it is this that to expect bad men

5335
04:09:45,010 --> 04:09:54,670
not to do wrong is madness, for he who expects this desires an impossibility. You

5336
04:09:55,410 --> 04:10:01,330
aberrations of the superior faculty, against which thou shouldst be constantly on thy guard.

5337
04:10:01,630 --> 04:10:07,750
And when thou hast detected them, thou shouldst wipe them out, and say on each occasion thus,

5338
04:10:08,030 --> 04:10:14,650
This thought is not necessary. This tends to destroy social union. This which thou art

5339
04:10:14,650 --> 04:10:21,270
going to say comes not from the real thoughts. For thou shouldst consider it among the most

5340
04:10:21,270 --> 04:10:27,570
absurd of things, for a man not to speak from his real thoughts, but to allow men to behave so

5341
04:10:27,570 --> 04:10:32,950
to others, and to expect them not to do thee any wrong, is irrational and tyrannical.

5342
04:10:33,630 --> 04:10:39,630
But the fourth is when thou shalt reproach thyself for anything. For this is an evidence

5343
04:10:39,630 --> 04:10:45,030
of the diviner part, within thee and being overpowered, and yielding to the less

5344
04:10:45,560 --> 04:10:51,390
and to the perishable part, the body, and to its gross, thy areo part.

5345
04:10:52,100 --> 04:10:57,220
And all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee, though by nature they have an upward

5346
04:10:57,220 --> 04:11:03,650
tendency, still in obedience to the disposition of the universe, they are overpowered here in

5347
04:11:03,650 --> 04:11:09,810
the compound mass, the body, and also the whole of the earthy part in thee, and the watery,

5348
04:11:10,210 --> 04:11:15,190
though their tendency is downward, still are raised up and occupy a position which is not

5349
04:11:15,190 --> 04:11:21,490
their natural one. In this manner, then, the elemental parts obey the universal, for when

5350
04:11:21,490 --> 04:11:27,470
they have been fixed in any place per force, they remain there until, again, the universal

5351
04:11:27,470 --> 04:11:33,850
shall sound the signal. Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be

5352
04:11:33,850 --> 04:11:40,230
disobedient and discontented with its own place, and yet no force is imposed on it,

5353
04:11:40,230 --> 04:11:46,310
but only those things which are conformable to its nature? Still it does not submit,

5354
04:11:47,290 --> 04:11:52,860
but is carried in the opposite direction. For the movement towards injustice and intemperance

5355
04:11:52,860 --> 04:11:58,220
and to anger and grief and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from

5356
04:11:58,220 --> 04:12:03,760
nature. And also, when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that happens,

5357
04:12:04,260 --> 04:12:08,860
then too it deserts its post, for it is constituted for piety and reverence towards

5358
04:12:08,860 --> 04:12:14,200
the gods, no less than for justice. For these qualities also are comprehended under the

5359
04:12:14,200 --> 04:12:20,440
generic term of contentment with the constitution of things, and indeed they are prior to acts

5360
04:12:20,440 --> 04:12:31,850
of justice. But what I have said is not enough, unless this also is added, what this object

5361
04:12:31,850 --> 04:12:38,410
ought to be. For as there is not the same opinion about all the things, which in some

5362
04:12:38,410 --> 04:12:44,590
way or other are considered by the majority to be good, but only about some certain things,

5363
04:12:45,070 --> 04:12:55,510
that is, things which concern the common interest, ourselves an object which shall

5364
04:12:55,510 --> 04:13:02,890
be of a common kind, social and political. For he who directs all his own efforts to this object

5365
04:13:03,380 --> 04:13:13,200
will make all his acts alike, and thus will always be the same. Socrates used to call

5366
04:13:13,200 --> 04:13:18,640
the opinions of the many, by the name of Lamiae, bug-bears to frighten children.

5367
04:13:26,070 --> 04:13:30,790
The Lacedaemonians at their public spectacles used to set seats in the shade for strangers,

5368
04:13:31,050 --> 04:13:37,500
but themselves sat down anywhere. Socrates excused himself to Perdiccas for not going to

5369
04:13:37,500 --> 04:13:44,240
him, saying, It is because I would not perish by the worst of all ends. That is, I would

5370
04:13:44,240 --> 04:13:49,520
not receive a favor and then be unable to return it. In the writings of the Ephesians

5371
04:13:49,520 --> 04:13:55,020
there was this precept constantly to think of some one of the men of former times who

5372
04:13:55,020 --> 04:14:00,520
practiced virtue. The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens, that we may be

5373
04:14:00,520 --> 04:14:06,460
reminded of those bodies which continually do the same things and in the same manner perform

5374
04:14:06,460 --> 04:14:15,220
their work, and also be reminded of their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over

5375
04:14:15,220 --> 04:14:25,270
a star. Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules for others

5376
04:14:25,270 --> 04:14:32,420
before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules thyself. Much more is nisso in life.

5377
04:14:35,680 --> 04:14:45,580
And my heart laughed within. When a man kisses his child, said Epictetus, he should whisper to

5378
04:14:45,580 --> 04:14:53,680
himself, To morrow perchance thou wilt die. But those are words of bad omen.

5379
04:14:53,680 --> 04:15:03,390
You need to add some text for me to talk. Epictetus also said, A man must discover

5380
04:15:03,390 --> 04:15:09,690
an art, or rules, with respect to giving his assent, and in respect to his movements he

5381
04:15:09,690 --> 04:15:14,670
must be careful that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent with

5382
04:15:14,670 --> 04:15:20,760
social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object. From it,

5383
04:15:21,540 --> 04:15:27,100
and as to avoidance, aversion, he should not show it with respect to any of the

5384
04:15:27,100 --> 04:15:32,580
things which are not in our power. The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape,

5385
04:15:32,800 --> 04:15:37,340
all are changes, not into nothing, but into something which exists not yet.

5386
04:15:38,240 --> 04:15:43,940
No man can rob us of our free will. The dispute then, he said, is not about any common

5387
04:15:43,940 --> 04:15:49,980
matter, but about being mad or not. And Socrates used to say, What do you want?

5388
04:15:50,540 --> 04:15:57,780
Souls of rational men, or irrational? Souls of rational men, of what rational men?

5389
04:15:58,220 --> 04:16:05,680
Sound or unsound? Sound. Why then do you not seek for them? Because we have them.

5390
04:16:05,900 --> 04:16:09,800
Why then do you fight and quarrel? Book 12

5391
04:16:09,800 --> 04:16:13,940
All those things at which thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous road,

5392
04:16:14,320 --> 04:16:18,080
thou canst have now, if thou dost not refuse them to thyself.

5393
04:16:18,080 --> 04:16:25,100
And this means, if thou wilt take no notice of all the past, and trust the future to providence,

5394
04:16:25,660 --> 04:16:31,440
and direct the present only conformably to piety and justice, conformably to piety,

5395
04:16:31,760 --> 04:16:36,520
that thou mayest be content with the lot which is assigned to thee, for nature designed it for

5396
04:16:36,520 --> 04:16:43,040
thee and thee for it, conformably to justice, that thou mayest always speak the truth freely

5397
04:16:43,040 --> 04:16:48,460
and without disguise, and do the things which are agreeable to law, and according to the worth of

5398
04:16:48,460 --> 04:16:54,940
each. If then, whatever the time may be, when thou shalt be near to thy departure,

5399
04:16:55,360 --> 04:17:00,700
neglecting everything else, thou shalt respect only thy ruling faculty and the divinity within

5400
04:17:00,700 --> 04:17:13,520
thee. And if thou shalt be afraid, worthy of the universe which has produced thee,

5401
04:17:14,080 --> 04:17:19,420
and thou wilt cease to be a stranger in thy native land, and to wonder at things which

5402
04:17:19,420 --> 04:17:25,920
happened daily, as if they were something unexpected, and to be dependent on this or that,

5403
04:17:26,420 --> 04:17:31,940
and let neither another man's wickedness hinder thee, nor opinion nor voice, nor yet the

5404
04:17:31,940 --> 04:17:37,080
sensations of the poor flesh which has grown about thee, for the passive part will look to

5405
04:17:37,080 --> 04:17:46,840
this. For with his intellectual part alone, he touches the intelligence only which has flowed,

5406
04:17:46,840 --> 04:17:53,990
men being derived from himself into these bodies. And if thou also usest thyself to do this,

5407
04:17:54,490 --> 04:18:00,070
thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble. For he who regards not the poor flesh which

5408
04:18:00,070 --> 04:18:05,710
envelops him, surely will not trouble himself by looking after raiment and dwelling and fame

5409
04:18:05,710 --> 04:18:16,590
and suchlike externals, and show. You need to add some text for me to talk. Therefore,

5410
04:18:16,590 --> 04:18:21,270
if thou shalt separate from thyself, that is, from thy understanding,

5411
04:18:21,770 --> 04:18:26,210
whatever others do or say, and whatever thou hast done or said thyself,

5412
04:18:26,810 --> 04:18:30,070
and whatever future things troubled thee because they may happen,

5413
04:18:31,520 --> 04:18:38,440
and whatever in the body which envelops thee, or in the breath, life which is by nature

5414
04:18:38,440 --> 04:18:45,610
associated with the body, the independent of thy will, and whatever the external

5415
04:18:46,130 --> 04:18:52,530
vortex whirls round, so that the intellectual power exempt from the things of fate can live

5416
04:18:52,530 --> 04:18:58,690
pure and free by itself, doing what is just, and accepting what happens, and saying the truth,

5417
04:18:58,990 --> 04:19:06,160
if thou wilt separate, I say. You need to add some text for me to talk.

5418
04:19:06,580 --> 04:19:11,400
The impressions of sense, and the things of time to come, and of time that is past,

5419
04:19:11,400 --> 04:19:18,260
and wilt make thyself, like Empedocles's sphere, all round and in its joyous rest reposing.

5420
04:19:20,830 --> 04:19:25,910
Of thy death, free from perturbations, nobly and obedient to thy own daemon,

5421
04:19:26,430 --> 04:19:30,290
to the God that is within thee, of these the first two are thine,

5422
04:19:30,770 --> 04:19:36,790
so far as it is thy duty to take care of them. But the third alone is properly thine.

5423
04:19:40,300 --> 04:19:46,440
If, then, a God or a wise teacher should present himself to a man, and bid him to think of nothing,

5424
04:19:46,780 --> 04:19:51,000
and to design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived it,

5425
04:19:51,360 --> 04:19:56,600
he could not endure it even for a single day. You need to add some text for me to talk.

5426
04:19:57,280 --> 04:20:02,420
How can it be that the gods, after having arranged all things well and benevolently for

5427
04:20:02,420 --> 04:20:09,670
mankind, have overlooked this alone, that some men, and very good men,

5428
04:20:13,610 --> 04:20:17,690
should never exist again but should be completely extinguished?

5429
04:20:18,330 --> 04:20:21,770
So much more respect have we to what our neighbors shall think of us

5430
04:20:21,770 --> 04:20:27,470
than to what we shall think of ourselves. But if this is so, be assured that if it ought

5431
04:20:27,470 --> 04:20:32,990
to have been otherwise, the gods would have done it. You need to add some text for me to talk.

5432
04:20:33,550 --> 04:20:40,520
But because it is not so, if in fact it is not so, be thou convinced that it ought not to have

5433
04:20:40,520 --> 04:20:49,300
been so. For thou seest even of thyself, that in this inquiry thou art disputing with the

5434
04:20:49,300 --> 04:20:57,570
deity, ordering of the universe to be neglected unjustly and irrationally. For if it were just,

5435
04:20:57,930 --> 04:21:03,150
it would also be possible, and if it were according to nature, nature would have had it

5436
04:21:03,150 --> 04:21:07,930
so. Practice thyself even in the things which thou despairest of accomplishing.

5437
04:21:08,310 --> 04:21:13,390
For even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things, for want of practice,

5438
04:21:13,810 --> 04:21:19,710
holds the bridle more vigorously than the right hand. For it has been. Consider in what

5439
04:21:19,710 --> 04:21:26,550
condition both in body and soul a man should be when he is overtaken by death, and n consider

5440
04:21:26,550 --> 04:21:34,360
the shortness of life, the boundless abyss of time, past and future, the feebleness of all

5441
04:21:34,360 --> 04:21:40,800
matter. Contemplate the formative principles, forms, of things bare of their coverings,

5442
04:21:41,260 --> 04:21:53,250
the purposes of actions. Consider what pain is, what pleasure is. In the application of thy

5443
04:21:53,250 --> 04:22:00,490
principles, thou must be like the pancratiast, not like the gladiator. For the gladiator lets

5444
04:22:00,490 --> 04:22:07,130
fall, the sword which he uses and is killed, but the other always has his hand, and needs

5445
04:22:07,130 --> 04:22:13,830
to do nothing else than use it. See what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter,

5446
04:22:14,030 --> 04:22:19,910
form, and purpose. What a power man has to do nothing except what God will approve,

5447
04:22:20,130 --> 04:22:26,030
and to accept all that God may give him. With respect to that which happens conformably

5448
04:22:26,030 --> 04:22:31,970
we ought to blame neither gods, for they do nothing wrong either voluntarily or involuntarily

5449
04:22:31,970 --> 04:22:40,200
nor men. Consequently we should blame nobody. How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who

5450
04:22:40,200 --> 04:22:45,540
is surprised at anything which happens in life. Either there is a fatal necessity,

5451
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:51,700
an invincible order, or a kind providence, or a confusion without a purpose and without

5452
04:22:51,700 --> 04:22:58,920
a director. If, then, there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou resist? But if there

5453
04:22:58,920 --> 04:23:04,080
is a providence which allows itself to be propitiated, make thyself worthy of the

5454
04:23:04,080 --> 04:23:09,840
help of the divinity. But, if there is a confusion without in governor, be content

5455
04:23:09,840 --> 04:23:16,670
that in such a tempest thou hast in thyself a certain ruling intelligence. And even if

5456
04:23:16,670 --> 04:23:22,990
carry thee away, let it carry away the poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else,

5457
04:23:23,230 --> 04:23:28,820
for the intelligence, at least it will not carry away. Does the light of the lamp

5458
04:23:28,820 --> 04:23:33,120
shine without losing its splendour until it is extinguished, and shall the truth

5459
04:23:33,120 --> 04:23:38,160
which is in thee and justice and temperance be extinguished before thy death? What a man

5460
04:23:38,160 --> 04:23:43,560
has presented the appearance of having done wrong, say, How, then, do I know if this

5461
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:54,620
is a wrongful act? Consider that he who would not have the bad man do wrong is like

5462
04:23:54,620 --> 04:24:00,080
the man who would not have the fig-tree to bear juice in the figs and infants to

5463
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:07,280
cry and the horse to neigh, and whatever else must of necessity be. For what must

5464
04:24:07,280 --> 04:24:12,780
a man do who has such a character? If, then, thou art irritable, cure this man's

5465
04:24:13,200 --> 04:24:18,960
disposition. If it is not right, do not do it. If it is not true, do not say it.

5466
04:24:19,610 --> 04:24:25,070
For let thy efforts be, in everything always observe what the thing is which produces

5467
04:24:25,070 --> 04:24:30,610
for thee an appearance, and resolve it by dividing it into the formal, the material,

5468
04:24:31,370 --> 04:24:37,430
the. Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better, and more divine than

5469
04:24:37,430 --> 04:24:42,490
the things which cause the various effects. And as it were, pull thee by the strings.

5470
04:24:43,610 --> 04:24:48,990
What is there now in my mind? Is it fear, or suspicion, or desire, or anything of

5471
04:24:48,990 --> 04:24:57,930
the kind? First, do nothing inconsiderately, nor without a purpose. Second, make thy acts

5472
04:24:57,930 --> 04:25:07,490
refer to nothing else than to a social end. E.N. Consider that, E.N. Consider that,

5473
04:25:07,690 --> 04:25:14,430
before long thou wilt be nobody. For all things are formed by nature to change

5474
04:25:14,430 --> 04:25:18,490
and to be turned, and to perish, in order that other things in continuous succession

5475
04:25:18,490 --> 04:25:24,050
may exist. Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power.

5476
04:25:24,390 --> 04:25:28,490
Take away, then, when thou choosest thy opinion, and like a mariner,

5477
04:25:28,670 --> 04:25:32,830
who has doubled the promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable,

5478
04:25:33,070 --> 04:25:39,690
and a waveless bay. Any one activity, whatever it may be, when it has ceased at

5479
04:25:39,690 --> 04:25:46,770
its proper time, suffers no evil. Because it has ceased, nor he who has done this act,

5480
04:25:47,330 --> 04:25:52,810
does he suffer any evil for this reason. In like manner, then, the whole which consists

5481
04:25:52,810 --> 04:25:59,350
of all the acts, which is our life, if it cease at its proper time, suffers no evil

5482
04:25:59,350 --> 04:26:05,930
for this reason that it has ceased. Nor he who has terminated this series at the proper time

5483
04:26:05,930 --> 04:26:11,750
has he been ill dealt with. But the proper time and the limit nature fixes, sometimes,

5484
04:26:11,750 --> 04:26:18,670
as in old age, the peculiar nature of man, but always the universal nature, by the change

5485
04:26:18,670 --> 04:26:24,850
of whose parts the whole universe continues, ever young and perfect. And everything which

5486
04:26:24,850 --> 04:26:30,430
is useful to the universal is always good, and in season. Therefore the termination of

5487
04:26:30,430 --> 04:26:36,450
for every man is no evil, because neither is it shameful, since it is both independent of the

5488
04:26:36,450 --> 04:26:42,650
will, and not opposed to the general interest, but it is good, since it is seasonable and

5489
04:26:42,650 --> 04:26:48,250
profitable to, and congruent with, the universal. For thus, too, he is moved by the

5490
04:26:48,250 --> 04:26:53,110
Deity, who is moved in the same manner with the Deity, and moved towards the same things

5491
04:26:53,110 --> 04:27:02,800
in his mind. In the things which thou doest, do nothing, either ninconsiderately or otherwise,

5492
04:27:02,800 --> 04:27:09,000
than as justice herself would act, but with respect to what may happen to thee from, without,

5493
04:27:09,580 --> 04:27:13,720
consider that it happens either by chance or according to providence, and thou must

5494
04:27:13,720 --> 04:27:20,540
neither blame chance nor accuse providence. Second, consider what every being is, from the

5495
04:27:20,540 --> 04:27:26,260
seed to the time of its receiving a soul, and from the reception of a soul to the giving

5496
04:27:26,260 --> 04:27:31,240
back of the same, and of what things every being is compounded, and into what things it

5497
04:27:31,240 --> 04:27:38,180
is resolved. You need to add some text for me to talk. Third, if thou shouldst suddenly be raised

5498
04:27:38,180 --> 04:27:43,760
up above the earth, and shouldst look down on human things, and observe the variety of them,

5499
04:27:43,960 --> 04:27:49,780
how great it is, and at the same time also shouldst see, at a glance, how great is the

5500
04:27:49,780 --> 04:27:55,460
number of beings who dwell around in the air and the ether, consider that, as often as

5501
04:27:55,460 --> 04:28:02,340
be raised up, thou wouldst see the same things, sameness of form and shortness of duration.

5502
04:28:02,940 --> 04:28:08,400
When thou art troubled about anything, thou hast forgotten this, that all things happen

5503
04:28:08,400 --> 04:28:14,500
according to the universal nature, and forgotten this, that a man's wrongful act is nothing to

5504
04:28:14,500 --> 04:28:25,180
thee. How close is the kinship between a man and the whole human race, for it is a community,

5505
04:28:25,180 --> 04:28:30,800
not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence. You need to add some text for me to talk,

5506
04:28:31,280 --> 04:28:36,920
and thou hast forgotten this, too, that every man's intelligence is a god, and is an efflux

5507
04:28:36,920 --> 04:28:43,380
of the deity, and forgotten this, that nothing is a man's own, but that his child and his body

5508
04:28:43,380 --> 04:28:48,080
and his very soul came from the deity, forgotten this, that everything is opinion,

5509
04:28:48,480 --> 04:28:55,160
and lastly, thou hast forgotten that every man lives the present time only, and loses only

5510
04:28:55,160 --> 04:29:00,800
this. In constantly bring to thy recollection those who have complained greatly about

5511
04:29:00,800 --> 04:29:07,060
anything, those who have been most conspicuous by the greatest fame or misfortunes or enmities

5512
04:29:07,060 --> 04:29:20,030
or fortunes of any kind, violently strain, and how much more philosophical it is for a

5513
04:29:20,030 --> 04:29:25,210
man and the opportunities presented to him to show, are these things to be proud of?
