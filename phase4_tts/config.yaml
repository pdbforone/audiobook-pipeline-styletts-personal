# config.yaml - Phase 4 TTS Configuration
# Why: Centralizes settings for reproducibility and easy tuning. Loaded in main.py.
# HQ Voice Cloning Tips: Use a clean 10-20s ref audio (e.g., neutral speech from LibriVox).
# Adjust exaggeration for emotion (0.0-1.0; higher for dramatic audiobooks), cfg_weight for stability.

sample_rate: 24000  # Matches model default; for high-quality audio
language: "en"      # Language ID for multilingual model
ref_url: "https://www.archive.org/download/roughing_it_jg/rough_09_twain.mp3"  # HQ public domain ref; download and trim in code
exaggeration: 0.5   # Emotion intensity (0.0 neutral, 1.0 dramatic)
cfg_weight: 0.5     # Pacing/stability (lower for faster speech)
temperature: 0.7    # Creativity/randomness (lower for consistent cloning)
sub_chunk_retries: 3  # Retries for failed sub-chunks to avoid artifacts
silence_duration: 0.5  # Seconds of silence for failed parts
enable_splitting: true  # NLTK-based splitting for long text (prevents truncation)
output_dir: "audio_chunks"  # Relative to phase4_tts; absolute in code
